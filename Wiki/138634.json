 "text": "\"A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld\" is a mix of a song by the ambient house group The Orb. The song is about being in love with a beautiful person. The song was at first a Minnie Riperton song called Lovin' You. The Orbs version was first sold in October 1989 and was in the UK Singles Chart in 1990, at number 78. In April 1991, it was sold as part of the album The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. The name is taken from a sound effects track from Blake's 7 on BBC Sound Effects No. 26 - Sci-Fi Sound Effects called \"The Core, A Huge Evergrowing Pulsating Brain which Rules from the Centre of Ultraworld\". == History == In 1989, The Orb, with Martin \"Youth\" Glover, developed the musical style of ambient house using samples. The best of their musical work came when The Orb recorded music for John Peel on BBC Radio 1. The song, then known as \"Loving You\", was made quickly with many sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and Minnie Riperton's \"Lovin' You\". Before the song was sold by record company Big Life, The Orb changed the name to \"A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld\". After the first week of sale Minnie Ripertons record company forced Big Life to remove her voice from the song. After the first week another singer sang the song. The Orbs version of the song was 19 minutes long and became number 78 on the UK Singles Chart. UK Singles Chart Week 01 02 03 Position == Tracklisting == === 12\": WAU!
