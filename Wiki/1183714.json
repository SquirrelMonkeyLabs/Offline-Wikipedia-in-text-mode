 "text": "Triphenylmethanol is an organic compound with the chemical formula . It is a molecule of methanol where the non-alcoholic hydrogen atoms have been replaced by phenyl functional groups. It is an ingredient in a type of dye called triarylmethane dyes. It is more basic than other alcohols. Protonation by a strong acid happens on the oxygen atom, and is followed by elimination of a water molecule. This leaves the very stable trityl cation, a carbocation with a positive charge on the central carbon atom. Triphenylmethanol was important to the discovery of carbocations. A solution of triphenylmethanol and sulfuric acid, two colorless chemicals, turns bright yellow. Adolf von Baeyer saw that this solution contained a salt-like chemical, now known as trityl bisulfate. von Baeyer named the tendency for organic compounds like triphenylmethanol to make colored salts \"halochromy\". == References == Category:Aromatic compounds Category:Alcohols Category:Bases",
