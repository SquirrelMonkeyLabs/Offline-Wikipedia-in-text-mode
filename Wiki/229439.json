It runs about 3 minutes and 44 seconds. The lyrics of the song tell of the horrors of the world and a longing for a \"life less frightening\" (\"...I'm soaking with the sins of knowing what's gone wrong...\") and tells that lack of action will only cause the problems to worsen (\"Time again I have found myself stuttering/Foundations pulled out from under me.\").
