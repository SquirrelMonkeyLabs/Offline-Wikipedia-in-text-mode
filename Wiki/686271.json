 "text": "The Rebel Alliance (or The Alliance to Restore the Republic) was a group of people and aliens in the Star Wars series that fought the Galactic Empire and brought back freedom and democracy to the Star Wars galaxy. Important characters in the Rebel Alliance were Princess Leia, Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO, as well as Jyn Erso, Kanan Jarrus, and Admiral Ackbar. After the Republic turned into the Empire, small cells of rebels loosely fought the Empire, led by Bail Organa. These cells later joined together into a larger Rebellion, stealing the plans of the Death Star and destroying it. Later, the Rebels fought again and destroyed the second Death Star, ending the Empire and restoring the Republic. Many of the Rebels would later join the Resistance against the First Order. == References == Category:Star Wars",
