 "text": "Kiryat Matlon is al neighborhood in Petah Tikva. People live in the western part. There is a high-tech industrial area in the eastern part. The neighborhood is near the Geha intersection, south of the Jabotinsky axis, north of Givat Shmuel and the Kfar Ganim neighborhood, and west of Derech Rabin and the Neve Oz neighborhood. == History == Kiryat Matlon was established by the Matlon family who bought the land from Baron Menashe. The Matlon family employed the Pinchas family to manage the orchard from the beginning of the 1930s to the end of the 1940s. Private houses were built which were sold. The orchard that the Pinhas family managed had a private well that supplied water to the orchard. Later, the well provided water to the residents of the neighborhood and to the house of the Pinhas family until the end of 1976. Then the ownership of the well was transferred to the Municipality of Pat along with the house that the Pinchas family lived in. That is still called \"Beit HaBaer\" to this day. The opening of Em HaMoshavot Bridge led to great interest in living in the neighborhood. In the second decade of the 21st century, detached houses were built there. == Industrial zone == The industrial area was named after the residential neighborhood in Petah Tikva that lies to the west of it. It was named after Moshe Matlon, who was one of its founders. Another name of the industrial area is \"Ramat Siv\", due to the number of fiber factories that were there. One of the main streets in the industrial area is called \"HaSivim\". The area was established in the 1940s at the initiative of the Association of Industrialists in Israel . The industrial zone covers an area of about 2,000 dunams. About 800 businesses operate there. This industrial zone is the third in scope in Petah Tikva, after Kiryat Aryeh and Segulah. Among the companies operating in Kiryat Matlon are AIG, Bezeq International, 012, ECI, Porsche Israel and Strauss Group, Teva. An entertainment complex has recently developed in Kiryat Matlon. Many pubs, cafes and restaurants have opened there. The heart of the complex is in the east of the industrial area, in \"Yachin Center\", which is the center of a large number of cafes and restaurants. ==References== Category:Petah Tikva",
