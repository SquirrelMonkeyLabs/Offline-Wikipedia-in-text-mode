The other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans,Bainbridge, David A. 2003. The X in sex: how the X chromosome controls our lives. Harvard. and in most other mammals. Although females have two X chromosomes, each cell can only have one X chromosome active. During early development, a process called X-inactivation occurs. In each cell one of the X chromosomes randomly deactivates. This causes different parts of the body to have different X-linked genes, and is responsible for the black and orange coloration of calico cats. == Related pages == *Sex determination *Karyotype *Chromosome == References == Category:Biological reproduction Category:Chromosomes",
