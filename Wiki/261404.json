It became the lead single from the album of the same name (1994). \"Amor Prohibido\" is about the relationship between a man and a woman. Their love is put to the test. These include problems over money, and their parents not supporting their relationship because they both come from different places. Some music reviewers believe the song is similar to the Romeo and Juliet story because of its theme of forbidden love. \"Amor Prohibido\" became one of the most successful singles, along with \"No Me Queda Más\", of 1994 and 1995. It later became one of Selena's signature songs. The song won awards at the Tejano Music Awards and at the Premio Lo Nuestros in 1994 and for the next three years. \"Amor Prohibido\" reached number one on the U.S. Hot Latin Songs and number five on the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts on Billboard. The song helped Selena attract larger and younger audiences to her concerts because of its different sounds. Selena chose to explore Latin dance-pop music with the song. She had usually recorded Tejano sounds. Non-Mexicans also started liking Tejano music because of the new sounds in Selena's music. The music video was filmed in Joshua Tree, California. It was released on all the Spanish-language television channels in the United States and Mexico on Valentine's Day. It was later certified gold by AMPROFON, while 500,000 copies were sold in the United States.

Selena was named the \"Top Latin Artist of the '90s\" and \"Best selling Latin artist of the decade\" by Billboard. This was because she had fourteen top-ten singles in the \"Hot Latin Songs\" chart, including seven number one hits.

Selena begins singing the song while walking in the desert, with the wind blowing her hair around. She sings of how much she really wants to hear her boyfriend speak. The video then changes scenes to Selena at the open door dancing and singing along with the song. After Selena spins around once, she is seen looking out from a window, seeing herself and her boyfriend dancing. She tells him that their love should not be about money and that they should not worry about what their parents had told them. More love scenes are shown with Selena and her boyfriend laughing and enjoying each other's company. After telling him that their love should be based on how much they love each other, Selena looks at her reflection in a small puddle.

The video ends with Selena and her boyfriend running away from the world and going into a new one together. == Track listing == ;U.S. Promo Single #Amor Prohibido - 2:50 ;Mexico Promo Single #Amor Prohibido - 2:50 == Credits and personnel == *Selena – vocals, producer *Stephanie Lynn – additional vocals *Rick Alvarez – additional vocals *Joe Ojeda – keyboards *Ricky Vela – keyboards *Chris Pérez – guitar *Henry Gomez – guitar *Johnny Saenz – accordion *Suzette Quintanilla – drums *Rene Gasca – trumpet *Gilbert Garza – trombone *Los Dinos – bajo sexto *A.B.
