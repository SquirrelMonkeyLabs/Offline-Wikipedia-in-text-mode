 "text": "The Norfolk Tides are a Minor League Baseball team from Norfolk, Virginia. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Tides are partnered with the Baltimore Orioles, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Orioles. The team is named \"Tides\" because Norfolk is located on the Chesapeake Bay. The Tides play at a stadium called Harbor Park, which opened in 1993. Before playing there, the team played at High Rock Park in 1961 and 1962, Frank D. Lawrence Stadium from 1961 to 1969, and Met Park from 1970 to 1992. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1960s establishments in the United States Category:Baltimore Orioles Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Sports in Norfolk, Virginia",
