They are one of the oldest car manufacturers in the world. They own other car companies such as Dodge, Jeep, and Ram Trucks. 1925 Chrysler Corporation was created by Walter P. Chrysler in 1925 when he renamed the Maxwell Motor Company. From 1998 to 2007, Chrysler was part of DiamlerChrysler, a large German company. Then it was owned by Cerberus Capital Management. Chrysler declared Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on August 30, 2009. In 1978 Lee Iacocca left Ford Motor Company to become president and CEO of Chrysler Corporation in 1978. In 1979 Lee Iacocca added the title of chairman, until his retirement in 1992. In 1979, Chrysler Corporation had financial problems. They got 1.5 billion dollars from the U.S. government. Then, Chrysler Corporation created the K-car platform, invented the minivan, and sold many trucks to the army. Chrysler Corporation acquired American Motors in 1988, and rebranded the auto company as Eagle. They slowly recovered. Chrysler is currently owned by Italian automotive Fiat, the two companies merged forming Fiat Chrysler Automobiles or FCA for short. FCA in 2020 merged with the PSA group to form Stellantis.
