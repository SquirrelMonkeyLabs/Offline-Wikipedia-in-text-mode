 "text": "The Minnesota Twins are a Major League Baseball team in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They began in 1901 as the Washington Senators, based in Washington, D.C. They moved to the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in 1961. That area is often called the \"Twin Cities\", so the team was renamed the \"Twins\". They have often worn a \"TC\" emblem on their uniforms and caps. As the Senators, they were not very successful overall. They had some strong teams in the 1920s and 1930s, but most years they played poorly. As the Twins, they have had much better success, with two World Series championships, in 1987 and 1991, and many other post-season games. They first played at Metropolitan Stadium in the suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota. They moved to the Metrodome in 1982, and then to Target Field in 2010. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Website Category:1960s establishments in Minnesota Category:1894 establishments in the United States Category:Sports in Minneapolis",
