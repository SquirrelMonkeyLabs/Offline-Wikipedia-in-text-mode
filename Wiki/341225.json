 "text": "The coat of arms of Antigua and Barbuda was made in 1966 by Gordon Christopher. It is similar to the Flag of Antigua and Barbuda. The symbolism is more complex. At the top of the Coat of Arms is a pineapple. The island is famous for this fruit. Many plants are around the shield: red hibiscus, sugarcane, and yucca plant. The pair of deer are for the wildlife of the islands. The shield shows the sun, also found on the flag, rising from a blue and white sea. The sun is for a new beginning. The black background is for the African origins of many of the nations's people. At the bottom of the shield, in front of the sea, sits a sugar mill. The national motto is at the bottom: \"Each endeavouring, all achieving\". Antigua and Barbuda Category:National symbols of Antigua and Barbuda",
