 "text": "The West Coast Conference (WCC) is a college sports conference (group of sports teams that play against each other) in the western United States. There are many sports in the conference. The conference does not have football, and only one of its current members has a football team. The WCC began in 1952 when five schools in and around the San Francisco Bay Area formed the California Basketball Association. The league was then called the West Coast Athletic Conference from 1956 to 1989. All nine of its current members were founded by churches. Seven of the colleges are Catholic schools. Only the University of the Pacific, which was started by Methodists, no longer gets money from a church. == Members == The WCC has 9 members, all located in West Coast states. Two other schools, one in a West Coast state and the other in the inland west, will join in 2025. Gonzaga will leave in 2026 for the Pac-12 Conference.
