He was also known as Rama IX. He was one of the world's longest-serving heads of state. His reign of 73 years and 126 days is the longest of any Thai monarch, the longest of an independent Asian sovereign and the third longest verified reign of any monarch of a sovereign state in history after Louis XIV and Elizabeth II. He was like a semi-divine figure for some Thais. ==Early life== Bhumibol was born at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. He was taught in Switzerland.
