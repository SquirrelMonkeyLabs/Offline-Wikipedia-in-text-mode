 "text": "MiG-23 Flogger is a Soviet interceptor-fighter aircraft. It first entered the Soviet Air Force in 1970. This is the first MiG that has variable geometry swing-wings, meaning that you can control the wings to be at a certain angle. The MiG-23 was a replacement for the MiG-21. It was used by Iraq in the Iran- Iraq War, the Kuwait Invasion, and the Gulf War. Today, it is still used, but not as much as other modern jets. ==References== Category:Soviet military aircraft",
