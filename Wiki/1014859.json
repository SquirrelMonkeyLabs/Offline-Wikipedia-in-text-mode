 "text": "Snap general elections are scheduled to be held in Ecuador in August 2023. Current president Guillermo Lasso was eligible for a second term, however he declined to run. ==Overview== The officials elected — to both the executive and legislative branches — will serve out the remainder of the current presidential and legislative terms (2021–2025). A regular election for a full four-year term will happen in early 2025. ==Background== Originally scheduled for 2025, the general elections were moved forward earlier after President Lasso used the muerte cruzada measure which dissolved the National Assembly to avoid impeachment. Advancing to the 15 October run-off, Luisa González of the Citizen Revolution Movement came in first place, winning 33% of the vote with Daniel Noboa of the National Democratic Action coming in second place with 24% of the vote. Noboa's second-place finish was seen as surprising and an upset. Noboa ended up beating González with 52% of the votes in the runoff election, a similar result to that of Guillermo Lasso in 2021, making Noboa the President-elect of Ecuador. At 35 years old, he is the youngest president in the country's history. == Presidential candidates == === Declared === Name Born Experience Announced Ref Otto Sonnenholzner (age ) Guayaquil, Guayas Vice President of Ecuador (2018–2020) Yaku Pérez Guartambel (age ) Cuenca, Azuay Provincial Prefect of Azuay Province (2019–2020) and 2021 presidential candidate Jan Topić (age ) Guayaquil, Guayas Businessman Daniel Noboa Azín (age ) Guayaquil, Guayas Member of the National Assembly (2021–2023) Bolívar Armijos Velasco 1980 (age ) San Lorenzo, Esmeraldas President of CONAGOPARE (2014–2019) Xavier Hervas (age ) Guayaquil, Guayas President of NovaAlimentos S.A.
