It featured the successful singles \"Novacane\" and \"Swim Good\". It was supposed to be reissued as an extended play, but this was cancelled. The mixtape caught the attention of rappers Kanye West and Jay-Z, who got Ocean as a featured artist on their Watch The Throne album. The mixtape caused controversy in March 2012 because of the track \"American Wedding\", which is a remake of \"Hotel California\" by The Eagles. ==Tracklisting== ==References== Category:2011 albums Category:R&B; albums",
