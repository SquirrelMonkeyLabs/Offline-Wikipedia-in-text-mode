 "text": "Many civil protests against poverty are taking place in several cities in Chile. The protests began in the capital Santiago as a campaign by secondary school students to avoid paying the Metro de Santiago subway in response to recent price hikes, leading to multiple takeovers of the city's main train stations. This had led to open confrontations with the national police (Carabineros). On 18 October, the situation escalated as organized bands of protesters rose in rebellion across the city, taking control of many terminals of the Santiago Metro network (part of Red) and disabling them with extensive infrastructure damage. The Metro network was disabled in its entirety. On 18 October, President of Chile Sebastián Piñera announced a state of emergency, sending Chilean Army forces across the main regions to enforce order and crack down on the destruction of public property because of privatization. A curfew was declared on 19 October in the Greater Santiago area, for the first time since 1987, at the end of the Pinochet dictatorship. ==References== Category:2019 crimes Category:2010s in Chile Category:2010s riots Category:Arson Category:Crime in South America Category:December 2019 events Category:February 2020 events Category:January 2020 events Category:November 2019 events Category:October 2019 events",
