 "text": "In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound to the catcher to begin each play, trying to retire a batter who tries to get on base, usually by hitting the ball with their bat or by taking a walk. A pitcher can also 'pick off' a base runner by throwing the ball to the baseman of the base they stepped off of if they don't make it back in time. This adds one out to the inning, putting the team closer to being able to bat. ==Related pages== * Baseball Category:Baseball positions",
