 "text": "Alcoholism is a dependence on alcohol. Alcoholism does not occur often in children and adolescents. When they do, it is usually called alcoholism in adolescence. True alchoholism can take a long time to develop, often years. When children and adolescents drink, they are more looking for binge drinking, having fun, and getting drunk together. Adolescents, aged 13-19 years, that have a problem with alcohol become violent more often. With boys around a third of the incidents where they become physically violent is caused by alcohol. With girls, about two thirds of these incidents are caused by alcohol. Adolescents with alcohol problems almost always also have problems at school. Category:Alcoholism",
