 "text": "The 1998–99 season was Manchester United's seventh season in the FA Premier League. It was also their 24th season in a row in the top division of English football. United won the Treble. They won the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. It was the first club in English football to win the Treble. That season, United lost only five times: in the Charity Shield against Arsenal; in the fifth round of the League Cup against Tottenham Hotspur (who later won the cup); and three times in the league. One time was at home, against Middlesbrough in December 1998. United did not lose for 33 games in all competitions, starting on 26 December at home to Nottingham Forest. They also won against Nottingham Forest 8–1 away from home in February 1999. This is Manchester United's record away win in the Premier League. The season was famous for United making comebacks (winning late in a match). For example, in the FA Cup fourth round against Liverpool and the semi-finals of the Champions League against Juventus. The most famous comeback was in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich. The team was losing 1–0 in the 90th minute, but Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored in injury time. Manchester United won 2–1, meaning they also won the treble. Some experienced players, Gary Pallister and Brian McClair, had left the club before the season started. The club bought players to replace them: Dutch defender Jaap Stam from PSV Eindhoven and Trinidadian striker Dwight Yorke from Aston Villa). In November 1998, goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel said he wanted to leave the club after eight years at Old Trafford. He went to Sporting CP at the end of the season. There was also a takeover bid of more than £600 million from BSkyB early in the season. However, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission blocked it in March 1999. Fans and writers view the Treble as manager Alex Ferguson's greatest success. Ferguson got a knighthood. He also got the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in November 1999. David Beckham won UEFA Club Footballer of the Year for the 1998–99 season. He was second to Rivaldo for the 1999 Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year awards. The only other English club to win the Treble is Manchester City in the 2022–23 season. == References == Category:Manchester United F.C.",
