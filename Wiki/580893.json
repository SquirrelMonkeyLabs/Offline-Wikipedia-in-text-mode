 "text": "The Seven Commandments of the Children of Noah are laws that must be followed by non-Jewish peoples, according to the Talmud. Some of them can be found in the Book of Jubilees. The seven laws are very similar to the Ten Commandments prescribed to Jews, as they do not allow idolatry, adultery, stealing, murder, and animal cruelty. Idolatry can also be called adultery of the soul. These were created to match the 10 commandments written by God, so the Gentiles could \"keep in line\". *1. \"No idolatry\" - There is only one god to worship. *2. \"No adultery\" - No \"cheating\" once you're married. *3. \"Don't eat meat taken from a still-living animal,\" as it constitutes cruelty. *4. \"Do not steal things from others,\" it's their property. *5. \"Keep God's good name,\" respect and praise him. *6. \"Do not murder or inflict harm on others\" *7. \"Set up a law system\" (to keep the peace) that agrees with God's ``basic laws``. ==References== * Category:Hebrew Bible",
