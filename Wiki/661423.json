 "text": "\"White Rabbit\" is a song written by Grace Slick and recorded by the American rock band Jefferson Airplane for their 1967 album Surrealistic Pillow. The song is notable for its opening bassline played by Jack Casady, its bolero- type form, and for its drug references, which are believed to be the first of their kind to make it past radio censorship. The song is influenced by Alice in Wonderland. It is notably used in the movie Platoon (not to be confused with the film's theme, which is Adagio for Strings). The song often appears on critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time, and at 2:31, it is often one of the shortest songs in length on these lists. Category:1967 songs",
