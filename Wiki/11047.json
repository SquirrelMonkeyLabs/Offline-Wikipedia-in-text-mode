 "text": "The Muppets are puppet characters created by Jim Henson. The characters include Kermit the Frog and the Muppet cast of Sesame Street. The Muppets are known for an absurd burlesque and humorous style of variety-sketch comedy. Jim Henson started work with the Muppets in the 1950s and continued until his death in 2009. He said the name \"muppet\" came from combining the words \"puppet\" and \"marionette.\" However, he also said he just liked the way the word sounded. The Muppets are now owned by The Muppets Studio and The Walt Disney Company. The term \"muppet\" is trademarked and owned by The Walt Disney Company. Muppets used in Sesame Street are still called muppets at times, and have special permission from The Walt Disney Company to use that name. == Description == Many of Jim Henson's muppets have large eyes, round noses, and large mouths that go from one end of the face to the other (almost ear to ear). Muppets are often made out of foam with felt on top. Puppeteers usually control the muppet with one hand in the head while the other hand controls the arms. Sometimes the arms have a stick that is used to move the hand and arm - this is called the \"arm rod.\" Puppeteers hold the arm rod at one end and the other end touches the muppet hand. Some muppets have hands that are gloves. Puppeteers put their hands in the gloves of these muppets so the muppet can move its fingers. For this reason, most muppets appear to favor their left hands. ==Muppeteers and their characters== ===Main Muppeteers=== Many Muppeteers voiced a variety of characters. For example, Jim Henson was the voice of Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog, The Swedish Chef, Dr. Teeth, Link Hogthrob, Mahna Mahna, Waldorf, Shakey Sanchez, Green Frackle, Green Heap, Beautiful Day Monster, The Newsman, Flower Eating Monster, Cantus the Minstrel, Sam, Harry the Hipster, Yorick, Emmet Otter, Timmy Monster, Lubbock Lou, and various other characters.
