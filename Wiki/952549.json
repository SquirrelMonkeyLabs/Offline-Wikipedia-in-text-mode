 "text": "A glottal consonant is a sound made using only the glottis. English has three glottal consonants, [h], as in hat, [ʔ], as in uh-oh, and [ɦ], as in uh-huh. The International Phonetic Alphabet has symbols for three glottal consonants: *[ʔ] - the glottal stop *[h] - the voiceless glottal fricative *[ɦ] - the voiced glottal fricative [h] and [ɦ] often are not true fricatives, and are more similar to voiceless vowels.
