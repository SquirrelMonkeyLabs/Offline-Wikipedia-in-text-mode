Annoyed and angered, the chipmunks plan to teach him a lesson, and approach the house where they discover that Donald's trying to pop some popcorn which they plan to get steal and eat. While he goes out to collect some firewood, the chipmunks enter the house and try to eat the uncooked popcorn. They aren't able to chew it, and a frustrated Chip kicks some bits of corn into the fireplace, which pops. Donald returns and pops a bowl of popcorn with Chip & Dale inside, but they find a way to steal his bowl. The duck enters a fierce battle with the chipmunks for possession of the popcorn, including swapping its location, and a game of catch, which ends with Donald trying to burn down Chip and Dale's tree.
