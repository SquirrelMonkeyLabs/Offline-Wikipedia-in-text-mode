 "text": "A second-class citizen is a person who is discriminated by their country, even though they are a citizen or legal resident. Second-class citizenry is usually seen as a violation of human rights. African-Americans who lived in the United States during segregation, Indian natives during British rule in India, and black Africans who lived in South Africa under apartheid, were often described in this way. Other groups of people that have been or still are being treated as second class citizens are the Dalit of India, and Arab Christians. ==Related pages== * Constitution * Constitutional economics * Makoto Sakurai Category:Social groups Category:Human rights abuses Category:Discrimination Category:Rights",
