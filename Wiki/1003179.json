John McCarthy and Bill Stone became partners in 1961, and in 1977 they built their first retirement housing development in Hampshire. Because the population was getting older they did very well. It is the largest provider of new Extra Care developments in the UK. In 2023 it opened its 500th retirement community. It supports more than 22,000 older people, mostly in their 80s. == References == Category:Old age Category:Housing in the United Kingdom Category:Social care",
