 "text": "In organic chemistry, a functional group is a piece of a molecule that helps determine how it reacts with other chemicals. Having specific functional groups is what defines a family of organic chemicals. Functional groups are usually specific arrangements of specific atoms, but can also be grouped into families with similar structures and reactinos (like methyl and ethyl both being in the alkyl family). Molecules can have more than one functional group and belong to multiple families. Some families, like amino acids, are defined by having multiple functional groups. A molecule with two functional groups is bifunctional, and a molecule with more is polyfunctional. ==Examples== *Alkyl *Alkene *Alkyne *Alcohol *Aldehyde (Like in Formaldehyde) *Carboxylic acid (Like in Acetic acid) *Ester *Ether *Ketone *Amine *Amide ==References== Category:Organic chemistry",
