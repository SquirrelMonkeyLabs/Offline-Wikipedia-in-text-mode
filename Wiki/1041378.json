 "text": "The karge Ponmudi bush frog (Raorchestes ponmudi) is a frog. It lives in southern India. Scientists saw this frog on Ponmudi Hill in the Western Ghat mountains, about 1000 meters above sea level. The frogs were sitting on plants 8-15 meters off the ground, high in the trees where the branches touch. Most of the time, people see them in evergreen trees. Sometimes people see them on coffee plants. The adult frog is 35.9-38.9 mm long from nose to rear end. Unlike other frog species, the male frogs of R. ponmudi are larger than the female frogs. They are larger than all other frogs and toads where they live. Each frog has two stripes from their eyes to their rear end. These stripes make an X on the back. There is a light brown between the eyes. The skin of the frog's belly is gray-yellow in color with some white and black. The back legs are light brown with gray marks. The iris of the eye is gold-bronw in color with a gray circle. There is some green color on the front legs. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
