During the 1980s, he was sued by his record company, Geffen Records, who believed he was making records that would not sell very many copies on purpose. Young won out over Geffen in court.

He is a long- time supporter of the family farmer. In 1985 Young, along with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp, co-founded the benefit concert called Farm Aid which has continued every year to help raise money to keep farmers in business. He also did not support George W. Bush when he was the president of the United States, and even wrote a song called \"Let's Impeach the President\" about how he thought Bush should lose his powers. In the 1970s, Young released two songs (on his After The Gold Rush and Harvest albums) critical of racism in the Southern United States. These songs were called \"Southern Man\" and \"Alabama\".
