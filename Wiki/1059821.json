 "text": "Fyter Fest (2019) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on June 29, 2019 at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida. It was the first Fyter Fest event held by AEW. The event was in co-sponsorship with the esports tournament Community Effort Orlando (CEO) and was held alongside it. It was streamed for free on B/R Live in Canada and the United States. The main event saw Jon Moxley defeat Joey Janela in an unsanctioned match. While on top of a bunch of thumbtacks, Moxley hit the Paradigm Shift on Janela into them and got the pinfall victory. This was the only Fyter Fest event to happen as a PPV event, as future events under that name aired as special episodes of AEW's television shows Dynamite, Rampage, and Collision. ==Matches== No. Matches Stipulations Times 1 Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta) defeated SoCal Uncensored (Frankie Kazarian and Scorpio Sky) and Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) Three-way Tag team match 16:00 2 Allie defeated Leva Bates (with Peter Avalon) Singles match 8:50 3 Michael Nakazawa defeated Alex Jebailey Hardcore match 9:30 4 Cima defeated Christopher Daniels Singles match 9:40 5 Riho defeated Yuka Sakazaki and Nyla Rose Three-way match 12:30 6 Adam Page defeated Jimmy Havoc, Jungle Boy (with Luchasaurus), and MJF Four-way match 10:50 7 Cody (with Brandi Rhodes) vs. Darby Allin ended in a time limit draw Singles match 20:00 8 The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) defeated Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Rey Fénix) and Laredo Kid Six-man tag team match 20:50 9 Jon Moxley defeated Joey Janela Unsanctioned match 20:00 ==References== Category:2019 in sports Category:2019 in the United States Category:AEW Fyter Fest Category:Daytona Beach, Florida Category:Sports in Florida",
