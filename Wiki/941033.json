 "text": "Phineas and Ferb is a Disney Channel cartoon television series created by Dan Povenmire and Swampy Marsh. It aired from 2007 to 2015 and inspired two spin- offs called The OWCA Files and Milo Murphy’s Law. It was also adapted into two movies: Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across The Second Dimension and the Disney Plus original movie Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Candace Against the Universe. ==Premise== Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher are two children who spend their summer vacation inventing new machines and/or building large contraptions so that they and their friends can have fun. Phineas’s sister Candace Flynn thinks that their mother would be angry with Phineas and Ferb if she saw the things they build so Candace spends each day trying to show her what Phineas and Ferb created to get her to punish them (or as Candace puts it to “bust” them.) But Phineas and Ferb’s pet platypus Perry is actually a spy secretly working for a group called OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym) known as Perry the Platypus or Agent P who spends every day fighting the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz. And every day Perry’s battle with Doofenshmirtz leads to him accidentally destroying whatever Phineas and Ferb built just before Candace shows it to her mother Linda so Linda sees nothing and doesn’t believe Candace who ends up looking crazy.
