 "text": "The Pontiac Vibe was a compact car made by General Motors with Toyota at New United Motor Manufacturing plant in Freemont, California. It was only sold as a five-door hatchback. The Vibe has the same engine and parts as the Toyota Matrix and Toyota Corolla. The Vibe and Matrix were made in different factories. The Vibe had replaced the Chevrolet Prizm in 2002 due to low sales and the discontinued Toyota Sprinter (Prizm was a mere rebadged version of this car).The Vibe was sold in Japan by Toyota as the Voltz from 2002 to 2004. Pontiac Vibe discontinued in 2009 due to General Motors and Toyota's decision to close down NUMMI. After Pontiac announced it would go out of business, General Motors announced that the Vibe would be replaced with Buick Verano (a badge engineered Opel Astra). Though it only offered limited AWD it was often categorized as a compact crossover and competed with the Dodge Caliber. Some components (IE: 2004-2008 AWD Front Wheel-bearings & front drive shafts, and HVAC Balancer valve) are not Toyota compatable.
