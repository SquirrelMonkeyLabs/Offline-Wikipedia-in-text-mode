 "text": "FNaF World is an indie based role-playing game (RPG) produced by Scott Cawthon. It was a spin-off of the popular horror video game series, 'Five Nights at Freddy's'. FNaF World was released on January 21, 2016 for Microsoft Windows and first announced on the gaming website/software Steam on September 15, 2015. The game was taken off of Steam because Scott Cawthon was not happy with the negative reviews and ratings it had received, although the game wasn't necessarily hated. It was republished to the Gamejolt Website after being updated, and it is still available today as a free-to-play title. ==References== Category:Role-playing video games",
