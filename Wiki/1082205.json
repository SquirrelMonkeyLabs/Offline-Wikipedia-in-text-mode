He was born in Vienna to a Jewish family but later abandoned Jewish customs to pursue secular studies in philosophy. In 1902, he owned the daily newspaper Die Welt - the central organ of the Zionist movement, although he later withdrew from Zionist organizing activities. In 1923, he wrote Ich und Du (\"I and Thou\"), and in 1925 began translating Hebrew Bible into German. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature ten times and the Nobel Peace Prize seven times. == References == Category:1878 births Category:1965 deaths Category:19th- century philosophers Category:Writers from Vienna Category:People from Lviv Category:People from Jerusalem",
