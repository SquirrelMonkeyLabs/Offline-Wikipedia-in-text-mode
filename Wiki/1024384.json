 "text": "The 2010 Australian federal election was held on 21 August 2010 to elect the 43rd Parliament of Australia. It was conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). The incumbent Labor government, led by Prime Minister Julia Gillard, won a second consecutive term in government, opposed by the Liberal/National Coalition, led by Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, in a minority government. The result delivered a hung parliament, with both major parties winning 72 seats. The Greens won one seat, the WA Nationals won one seat and independents won four seats. It is the most recent Australian federal election to have been won by a Prime Minister from a state other than New South Wales. ==References== Category:2010 elections in Australia",
