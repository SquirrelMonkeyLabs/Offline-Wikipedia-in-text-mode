 "text": "Cartoon Network Studios is an American animation studio owned by the Warner Bros. Television Studios division of Warner Bros., a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). The studio is the production arm of Cartoon Network, and started operating on October 21, 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera until the latter absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001. Located in Burbank, California, the studio primarily produces and develops animated programs and shorts for Cartoon Network and later Cartoonito. In the 2010s and beyond, their programs began to expand into their sister companies Adult Swim and HBO Max. So far, the company has only produced one theatrically released film, The Powerpuff Girls Movie, distributed by its sister company, Warner Bros. Pictures. The actual animation service for their productions is done overseas, mainly in South Korea at Digital eMation, Saerom Animation, Rough Draft Korea, and Sunmin Image Pictures, with pre-production and post-production being United States-based. == Filmography == === TV series === Title Year(s) Creator(s)/ Developer(s) Co-production(s) Network Notes 1990s What a Cartoon! 1996–97 Fred Seibert Cartoon Network Also known as World Premiere Toons, The What-A- Cartoon!
