 "text": "The Prodremotherium is one of the most ancient ancestors of the giraffe and the okapi. It is a member of the Gelocidae family. It lived largely in Europe. There are three genera in the Deinotheriidae family: Prodeinotherium, Europe, Africa, and Asia; the other two genera include Chilgatherium from Africa. Deinotherium came after Prodeinotherium, while Chilgatherium came before it. The original Prodeinotherium species, P. hobleyi, spread throughout Asia and Europe before changing into P. pentapotamiae and finally P. bavaricum. Before Deinotherium took its place, Prodeinotherium survived the Early and Middle Miocene. Though more evolved than Barytherium and Moeritherium, the deinotheriids represent an early branch of the proboscideans. == References == Category:Even-toed ungulates",
