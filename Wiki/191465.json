Exploring the Dynamics of Collaboration in Interorganizational Settings, Ch. 4, p. 83, in Schuman (Editor). Creating a Culture of Collaboration . Jossey-Bass, 2006. . It involves co-operation and teamwork and the sharing of ideas, knowledge and skills to reach the same objective.Collaboration, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, 2007 The objective is usually creative in nature.Collaboration, Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., (1989). J. A. Simpson & E. S. C. Weiner (eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press. Most collaboration needs leadership or some kind of co-ordination, although responsibilities can be shared within an egalitarian group.Spence, Muneera U. \"Graphic Design: Collaborative Processes = Understanding Self and Others.\" (lecture) Art 325: Collaborative Processes. Fairbanks Hall, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. 13 April 2006. Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the process of collaboration. For instance, to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough. Not only individuals collaborate; groups also do it. Large construction projects are usually done by collaborations between corporations, wars are often fought between alliances of countries, and political parties often collaborate in government. ==Related pages== * Critical thinking ==References== Category:Communication",
