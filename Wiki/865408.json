 "text": "Phyllomedusa is a genus of tree frogs in the family Phyllomedusidae. These frogs live in tropical and subtropical South America and Panama. There are 16 species in this genus. ==Secretion== Some Phyllomedusa frogs make a waxy substance that stops water from leaving their bodies through their skins. If the frogs begin to dry out, they spread the waxy substance over their skin. ==Reproduction== These frogs put their eggs on leaves above water. They put jelly next to the eggs. Then the frogs fold the leaves around the eggs with their legs. The jelly acts as a plug so the eggs do not fall out. When the tadpoles hatch, the jelly turns to liquid and the tadpoles fall through into the water below. ==Scientific classification== Most of these species are in Phyllomedusa, but some scientists say some of these frogs should be in Pithecopus instead. * Phyllomedusa azurea (in Pithecopus) * Phyllomedusa bahiana * Phyllomedusa bicolor, giant leaf frog * Phyllomedusa boliviana * Phyllomedusa burmeisteri, Burmeister's leaf frog * Phyllomedusa camba, black- eyed monkey frog * Phyllomedusa chaparroi * Phyllomedusa coelestis * Phyllomedusa distincta * Phyllomedusa iheringii * Phyllomedusa neildi * Phyllomedusa sauvagii, painted-belly leaf frog * Phyllomedusa tarsius, tarsier leaf frog * Phyllomedusa tetraploidea * Phyllomedusa trinitatis * Phyllomedusa vaillantii, white-lined leaf frog * Phyllomedusa venusta, lovely leaf frog Scientists used to put some other frogs in Phyllomedusa, but now they put them in other phyllomedusid genera: Callimedusa and Pithecopus. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==Other websites== *Phyllomedusa Gallery with some infos *Use of the Phyllomedusa bicolor venom as a vaccine by the Matses Indians, with pharmacological info Category:Frogs of South America",
