 "text": "The Mitsubishi i-MiEV (MiEV stands for Mitsubishi innovative Electric Vehicle) is a five-door electric city car produced in the 2010s by Mitsubishi Motors. It is the electric version of the Mitsubishi i. Rebadged variants of the i-MiEV are sold by PSA as the Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero, primarily in Europe. The i-MiEV was the world's first modern highway-capable mass production electric car. ==History== The i-MiEV was launched for fleet customers in Japan in July 2009 and The i-MiEV was known for being one of the most fuel-efficient vehicles at its time, ranking first in the U.S. EPA’s 2012 Annual Fuel Economy Guide. ==Markets== The i-MiEV was launched in Japan for fleet customers in July 2009 and for the public on April 1, 2010. International sales to Asia, Australia, and Europe started in 2010, with further markets in 2011, including Central and South America. Sales in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2011. ==Discontinuation== The Mitsubishi i-MiEV was discontinued in 2021 after over a decade of production. The decision to phase out the model was influenced by various factors, including declining demand and Mitsubishi's strategic shift towards new electric vehicle (EV) models and technologies. While the i-MiEV was pioneering as the first mass-produced electric vehicle to be sold globally, it faced stiff competition from more advanced and efficient EVs in the market. As a result, Mitsubishi shifted its focus to newer electric and hybrid models, such as the Mitsubishi eK X EV in Japan, which replaced the i-MiEV as the company's flagship small electric vehicle. ==References== Category:Mitsubishi automobiles fo:Mitsubishi i-MiEV pa:مٹسوبیشی مائیو",
