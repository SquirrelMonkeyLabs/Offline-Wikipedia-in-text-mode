The first-born son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, Hector was the heir apparent to the throne and the greatest of Troy's warriors in the defense of the city. Hector fought against a various number of the Greeks through the course of the Trojan War, including Protesilaus and Ajax. He was married to Andromache, with whom he had a son, Astyanax, whom the Trojans called Scamandrios. Hector is eventually killed by Achilles (Book XXII of The Iliad). == Related pages == *624 Hektor ==Other websites== * * Category:People in Greek mythology",
