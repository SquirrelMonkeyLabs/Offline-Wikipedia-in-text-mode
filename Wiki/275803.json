 "text": "Rites of Spring was an American emo band from Washington, D.C. They formed in 1984. The band was known for its fast, energetic live performances. Rites of Spring was a part of the D.C. hardcore punk scene. They increased the violence and passion of hardcore while at the same time experimenting with its rules. Compared to other bands of the time, their lyrics were very personal. This led to them being considered the first emo band. The band only performed 15 concerts during their time. The band disbanded in 1986. Singer and guitarist Guy Picciotto and drummer Brendan Canty went on to play in the post-hardcore band Fugazi in the late-1980s through the 2000s. ==References== Category:Emo bands Category:Post-hardcore bands",
