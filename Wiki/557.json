It is to the east of the Pacific Ocean, the west of the Atlantic Ocean, the south of the Arctic Ocean, and it is the northern part of the Americas. The southernmost part is Central America. It is the third largest continent in the world after Asia and Africa. North America has a population of around 528 million, and is the 4th most populous continent in the world. North America has three subregions which are the Caribbean, Central America, and North America. Depending on how it is used, \"North America\" can be used to mean as the continent as a whole to include all 23 countries or as a subregion to mean Canada, Mexico, and the United States only. Hundreds of millions of years ago, North America was part of a larger ancient supercontinent named Laurasia. A few million years ago, a new land bridge arose and connected North America to South America. Beringia connected North America to Siberia a few times during ice ages in the past 20,000 years. North America has many warm tropical islands such as the Bahamas. North America is currently north of South America. ==Countries== Flag Official name(s) Area (km2 or sq mi) Population Density (pop. km2) Capital Official language(s) Antigua and Barbuda 101,489 622 St. John's English Bahamas Commonwealth of the Bahamas 358,508 24 Nassau English Barbados 303,431 755 Bridgetown English Belize 419,137 16 Belmopan English Canada 38,486,736 5 Ottawa English French Costa Rica Republic of Costa Rica 5,256,612 112 San Jose Spanish Cuba Republic of Cuba 10,985,974 95 Havana Spanish Dominica Commonwhealth of Dominica 74,656 96 Roseau English Dominican Republic 10,790,744 188 Santo Domingo Spanish El Salvador Republic of El Salvador 6,670,304 330 San Salvador Spanish Grenada 114,700 477 St. George's English Guatemala Republic of Guatemala 17,980,803 133 Guatemala City Spanish Haiti Republic of Haiti 11,270,161 77 Port-au-Prince French Honduras Republic of Honduras 9,571,352 92 Tegucigalpa Spanish Jamaica Republic of Jamaica 2,830,932 232 Kingston English Mexico United Mexican States 129,875,729 87 Mexico City Spanish Nicaragua Republic of Nicaragua 6,359,689 221 Managua Spanish Panama Republic of Panama 4,404,108 66 Panama City Spanish Saint Kitts and Nevis Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis 54,817 313 Basseterre English Saint Lucia 167,591 586 Castries English Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 100,814 722 Kingstown English Trinidad and Tobago Republic of Trinidad and Tobago 1,534,937 295 Port of Spain English United States United States of America 338,946,000 15 Washington, D.C.
