 "text": "A false alarm is an alert that is caused in error. False alarms can happen because of a problem with a technical system (like a faulty fire alarm), or they occur because someone alerted the emergency services in error. Many countries have laws that make causing a no alarm with lousy intent (such as making hoax calls to the Police or Fire department) illegal. If there is no bad intent, there is also no punishment.
