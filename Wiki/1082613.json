 "text": "Alexandra Grant (born 1970) is an American artist who is known for checking language and written texts by things like painting, drawing, and other art. A large part of her art involves talking with writers and language. Grant sees how writing and ideas relate to language theory in art. Grant also makes pictures that are inspired by words and has worked with other people to set up art displays. She lives in Los Angeles and has been in a relationship with Canadian actor Keanu Reeves since November 2019. ==Personal life== At a party in 2009, Grant got to meet Canadian actor Keanu Reeves. The result of this meet led to the two creating a book called Ode to Happiness, which they released in the start of 2011. This was Grant and Reeves' first book together. It was also Reeves's first book as a writer and Grant's first as an artist. Grant and Reeves worked again in 2016 on Shadows, their second work that included a book and a set of images. In November 2019, Grant got into a relationship with Reeves. ==Notes== == References == Category:Living people Category:1970 births",
