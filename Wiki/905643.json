 "text": "A superabundant number is a type of natural number. They were defined by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős in 1944. ==Definition== Any natural number n is called superabundant when a certain equation is true. : \\frac{\\sigma(m)}{m} < \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{n} In this equation, m is every integer less than n. σ is the sum of every positive divisor of that number. An example would be to use the number 9. For every number less than 8, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 10, 8 and 16. (σ(m))/m is 16/9. (σ(n))/n is equal to 13/9. 13/9 is less than 16/9. This makes 9 not a superabundant number The first few superabundant numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, ... . == Properties == Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős proved that if n is superabundant, then there is a k and a1, a2, ..., ak such that : n=\\prod_{i=1}^k (p_i)^{a_i} where pi is the i-th prime number, and : a_1\\geq a_2\\geq\\dotsb\\geq a_k\\geq 1. Basically, they proved that if a number is superabundant, the exponent of a larger prime number is never bigger than a smaller prime number during prime decomposition(the process of a composite number become smaller prime numbers). All primes from 0 to p_k are also factors of n. The equation says that a superabundant number has to be an even integer. It also is a multiple of the k-th primorial p_k\\\\#. Superabundant numbers are like highly composite numbers. Not all superabundant numbers are highly composite numbers, though. Alaoglu and Erdős observed that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. == References == * . * . * . == Other websites == * MathWorld: Superabundant number Category:Integer sequences",
