 "text": "Murad II (, , 16 June 1404 – 3 February 1451) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1421 to 1444 and from 1446 to 1451. Murad II's reign was a period of important economic development. The amount of trade grew during his rule. Ottoman cities grew larger as well. In 1432, Bertrandon de la Broquière noted that Ottoman yearly revenue rose to 2,500,000 ducats. He said that if Murad II had used all of the resources of the Empire, he could easily have invaded Europe. Murad II defeated a large group of Crusader armies from different states of Europe at the Battle of Varna. ==Refernces== Category:1404 births Category:1451 deaths Category:Sultans of the Ottoman Empire",
