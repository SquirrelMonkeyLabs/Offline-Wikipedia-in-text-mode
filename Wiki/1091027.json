As for the pieces, they are designed so players can merge them. == Gameplay == Chessplus is played similarly to basic chess, but pieces can merge. The only piece that can not merge is the king. Pieces can only merge with other pieces of their own color. Only 2 pieces can be merged at a time. Pieces may split, in which they use their original move. Names of Piece Combinations First Piece Second Piece Combination Name Queen Queen DQueen Queen Bishop Quishop Queen Knight Quight Queen Rook Quook Queen Pawn Quawn Bishop Knight Bight Bishop Bishop DBishop Bishop Rook Biook Bishop Pawn Biawn Knight Knight DKnight Knight Rook Knook Knight Pawn Knawn Pawn Pawn DPawn === Castling === Castling may be done with a piece merged with a rook. Just like in regular chess, the rook can not have moved. For example, if a knight moved to combine with a rook, castling is possible, but if that rook moved to combine with the knight, then that rook can no longer castle. === En passant === Similar to the castling rules, en passant can only be used on a combination of 2 pawns. If the combination were to be a pawn and another piece, en passant is not allowed. == Inspiration == It was inspired by an illegal move the leader's daughter, Aimee, who, at age 8, made during a chess match with her father. == Reception == Chessplus received mostly good reviews. == References == == Further reading == * https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/research/reports/HonsReps/2020/hons_2002.pdf * ChessPlus - A great Christmas gift Category:Chess variants *[c.]: circa",
