 "text": "Plymouth Rock is an American historic site in Plymouth, Massachusetts. People say the Mayflower Pilgrims arrived there in 1620. But, they may not have. Edward Winslow did not mention the rock in Mourt's Relation (1620–1621). William Bradford did not mention it in his journal Of Plymouth Plantation (1620–1647). The first written reference to the Pilgrims landing on a rock is found 121 years after they landed. ==References== == Other websites == Category:History of Massachusetts Category:Plymouth Colony",
