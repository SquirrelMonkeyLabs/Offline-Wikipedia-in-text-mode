 "text": "The convection zone (or convective zone) is a layer of the Sun. The Sun has three inner layers: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. Outside these are three outer layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona (the Sun's atmosphere). The convective zone helps to transfer heat from the inside of the Sun to its surface. Specifically, in this zone, energy (in the form of hot gases) is transferred to the photosphere by convection. This allows the energy to escape in the form of sunlight and heat. ==References== Category:Sun",
