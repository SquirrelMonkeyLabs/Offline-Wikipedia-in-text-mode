 "text": "Jean-Yves Stephane Marcel Raimbaud (February 27, 1958 – June 28, 1998) was a French animator and screenwriter. He is known for creating the animated series, \"Oggy and the Cockroaches\", which officially debuted on September 6, 1998, on the television channel France 3. Raimbaud died in June 1998. == Early life == Raimbaud was born on the 27th February in 1958, in Évreux, France. At the age of 14, he abandoned his studies in favor of training as a painter. He made his debut in drawing, although initially, he mainly drew billboards. == Career == In 1975, he joined a small animation studio called DIC Entertainment, founded by Jean Chalopin. This was where he learned how to make cartoons. In the studio, he met the directors Bruno Bianchi (Inspector Gadget) and Bernard Deyriès (The Mysterious Cities of Gold). In 1986, Raimbaud created his own studio, Jingle, with Christian Masson ( an advertiser and producer). It was not until 1988 that Jingle itself made a series: Manu, created by cartoonist Frank Margerin. 104 episodes were shown on La Cinq, starting in March 1990. In 1992, the bankruptcy of La Cinq caused the closure of many companies, and in 1993, Jingle became bankrupt. === Gaumont Multimedia === By then, Raimbaud was well known, and Gaumont Film Company hired him to revive the films of Asterix and Lucky Luke that were last produced in the 1970s. Raimbaud was promoted to artistic director of the new studio, Gaumont Multimedia. Raimbaud began working on Highlander: The Series for M6. During this time, he also created the series \"The Little Witches.\" The series was produced by Millésime Productions for TF1, and it was sold cheaply in Europe. Raimbaud created the series \"Home to Rent\" in the style of 1950s cartoons. The title of the series became \"Space Goofs\" during its broadcast in France in September 1997. The series became one of the most popular programs introduced. It was also exported beyond France. == Illness and death == Raimbaud had been diagnosed with lung cancer in the early 1990s according to a doctor, and he died of it on June 28, 1998, in Paris, France. == Creations' success == Space Goofs was popular with children and adults. It received a second season in the 2000s, a single of \"Monster Men\" (the theme song, by Iggy Pop), a few DVD releases, a video game adaptation co-produced by Ubisoft Entertainment, and an unfinished film adaptation that only had one preview available online. However, Oggy and the Cockroaches became his longest-running franchise, due to it being under Xilam's ownership – receiving 7 seasons, 2 spinoffs (Oggy Oggy and Oggy and the Cockroaches Next Generation), and a film adaptation. The series was also popular in certain countries including India. Both of these television series were officially available within their official YouTube channels. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1958 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Évreux Category:French animators Category:French screenwriters Category:Writers from Normandy",
