 "text": "Macbeth (Mac Bethad mac Findlaích in Gaelic) was King of Scotland from 1040-1057. William Shakespeare wrote a famous play about him called Macbeth. In the play, Macbeth is an evil king who murders his cousin so he can become king. == Birth == Macbeth was born around 1005 in Morayshire, Scotland. His name in Gaelic was \"Mac Bethad mac Findlaích\" (in modern Gaelic, it is MacBheatha mac Fhionnlaigh), meaning \"son of life\". His father was Findláech mac Ruaidrí, Mormaer of Moray. When Macbeth was born, he became Mormaer of Moray. Macbeth's mother, Donada, may have been Malcolm II's second daughter. == Marriage == In 1032, before he became king, Macbeth married Gruoch of Scotland (called \"Lady Macbeth\" in English). They remained married until his death in 1057. She died three years later, in 1060. == Children == Macbeth may have had one child with Gruoch, but this is not certain. This child was Ferchar Og, Prince of Scots. Macbeth did have a stepson, Lulach, who succeeded him as king but died in 1058. == King of Scots == On 14 August 1040, Macbeth murdered his cousin King Duncan I in battle and was crowned King of Scotland. Macbeth was defeated by Duncan's son Malcolm (Canmore) and his ally Siward of Northumbria at Dunsinane Hill in 1054. Specifics of Macbeth's death are uncertain, being mortally wounded in skirmishing about the Cairn o'Mounth Pass into the Dee Valley, or at the Battle of Lumphanan on 15 August 1057. Macbeth was succeeded by his stepson Lulach the Simple (son of Gruoch by her first marriage), although Lulach's authority extended only over northern Scotland. In 1058, Lulach was killed in battle at Essie by his cousin Malcolm III, who then became king. == Burial == Macbeth's burial most likely took place soon after his death. He was buried in Iona, Scotland. This is a place where many kings have been buried, starting with the mythical first King of Scots, Kenneth MacAlpin. == Media == Macbeth is seen in a famous play by William Shakespeare, where he kills his cousin. In real life, Macbeth was more peaceful than this, though he did kill King Duncan I of Scotland. == References == Category:Kings and Queens of Scotland Category:1057 deaths Category:1000s births Category:11th century in Scotland",
