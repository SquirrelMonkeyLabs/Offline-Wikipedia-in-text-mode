 "text": "The Lightning Thief is a 2005 fantasy-adventure novel which is based on Greek mythology. It is the first young-adult book written by author Rick Riordan. It is the first book in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. The series is about the adventures of a modern 12-year-old named Percy Jackson after he discovers he is a demigod (half-human, half-god). Percy is the son of a mortal woman, named Sally Jackson and the Greek god Poseidon. Percy and his friends try to prevent a war between the Greek gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Rick Riordan finished writing his manuscript in 1994. The Lightning Thief was first bought by Bantam Books in 1997. Bantam sold it to Miramax Books. Miramax published it on June 28, 2005. The book sold more than 1.2 million copies in the next four years. The book won many awards. In 2007, it was on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's books. It was one of the Young Adult Library Services Association's Best Books for Young Adults. It was made into a movie named Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. The movie was first shown in the United States on February 12, 2010. The next book in the series is The Sea of Monsters. == Concept and development == Planning for both The Lightning Thief and the series began when Riordan started making up stories for his nine-year-old son, Haley. He had started studying Greek mythology (stories) in second grade. He wanted his father to tell him stories about them before he went to sleep. Riordan had taught Greek myths as a middle school teacher. He remembered some of the myths, which he then told to his son. Soon, Riordan had told him all the stories. When Haley wanted him to make up new stories using the characters from the myths, Riordan created the character of Percy Jackson. Like Percy, Haley had ADHD and dyslexia. He made up the story of how Percy traveled across the United States to search for Zeus' master bolt. After hearing the story, Haley wanted his father to write a book about Percy and his friends. In June 1994, Riordan finished the story. He started looking for agents to publish it. He went to many local colleges to find an editor before finding an agent. He gave his manuscript to his agent and editor to review. At the same time, he gave the book to some sixth, seventh and eighth graders to read and tell him what was good or bad about it. They named the book and helped Riordan describe how Percy's sword (Riptide) worked. In June 1997, Riordan signed with Bantam Books to prepare the book for publishing. In 2004, Miramax Books bought the book. The money was enough for Riordan to quit his teaching job and spend his time on writing. The book was published on June 28, 2005. It sold over 1.2 million copies. The book had hardcover, softcover and audio editions. It has been translated into many languages. It has been published all over the world. == Plot == The Lightning Thief is a fantasy–adventure novel which uses the ideas of ancient Greek mythology in today's world. It is written in a fast-paced, humorous (funny) style. === Summary === Percy Jackson is a 12 year old boy. He has ADHD and dyslexia. He has been thrown out of many schools.

He is under the care of Luke Castellan, the cabin counselor (leader). During a game, the children of the war god Ares attack Percy. He is healed when he steps into a river. When Poseidon's trident appears above his head, Percy learns that he is Poseidon's son. After World War II, Poseidon, Hades and Zeus made an oath (promise) not to have any more children because they were too powerful. However, Poseidon broke the oath by having Percy. Chiron tells Percy to find Zeus' master lightning bolt. Chiron thinks Hades stole the bolt. However, Zeus discovers that Poseidon has broken his oath, and thinks Poseidon told Percy to steal the bolt. He tells Percy that he has ten days until the summer solstice to find it. Before leaving, Luke gives Percy magic shoes. Percy gives them to Grover (a satyr and Percy’s best friend from Yancy). Annabeth (a daughter of Athena) and Grover join Percy in his quest to find the bolt. They decide to travel west to reach the entrance to the Underworld, which is in Los Angeles. They also meet Ares. When they come near the pit of Tartarus, Luke’s shoes try to pull Grover into it, but he escapes. Percy meets Hades, who also thinks Percy stole the Master Bolt. He also thinks Percy stole his Helm of Darkness. Percy knows that Ares has tricked him when he finds the bolt in his backpack. He runs away from the Underworld. He has to leave his mother there. Percy fights and wins. Ares gives Percy the Helm of Darkness. Percy gives it back to Hades. Olympus is now present at the top of the Empire State Building in New York City. Percy arrives there to give the master bolt to Zeus. Percy goes back to camp after hearing that his mother is alive. He meets Luke, who says that he stole the bolt for Kronos.

Kirkus praised the book and said, \"Packed with humorous (funny) allusions to Greek mythology and clever updates of the old stories, along with rip-snorting [intense] action sequences, the book really shines in the depiction of Percy – wry, impatient, academically hopeless, with a cut-to-the-chase bluntness one would wish for in a hero of old.\" Eoin Colfer, author of Artemis Fowl, called it \"A fantastic blend (mix) of mythology and modern\". Publishers Weekly also praised the book, regarding it as \"swift and humorous\" and added that the book would \"leave many readers eager for the next installment.\" On April 8, 2007, The Lightning Thief was ranked ninth on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's books.
