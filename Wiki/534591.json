 "text": "Caesar's Comet (C/-43 K1) is also known as 'Comet Caesar' and the 'Great Comet of 44 BC'. It was one of the most famous comets of ancient times. Many Romans thought the comet's seven-day appearance was a sign of the deification of recently assassinated dictator, Julius Caesar (100–44 BC).Grant, Michael 1970. The Roman Forum. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 94. Caesar's Comet was one of only five comets known to have had a negative absolute magnitude and may have been the brightest daylight comet in history.Flare-up on July 23–25, 44 BC (Rome): −4.0 (Richter model) and −9.0 (41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresák model); absolute magnitude on May 26, 44 BC (China): −3.3 (Richter) and −4.4 (41P/TGK); calculated in Ramsey and Licht, The Comet of 44 B.C. and Caesar's Funeral Games, p. 236. It was not periodic, and it had a parabolic orbit. The comet might now be more than 800 AU from the Sun. == References == Category:Comets",
