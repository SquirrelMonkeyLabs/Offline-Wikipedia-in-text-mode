 "text": "The Mato Grasso leaf frog (Pithecopus centralis) is a frog that lives in Mato Grasso in Brazil. People have seen it higher than 520 meters above sea level. This frog lives in drier places than other frogs: grasslands with many rocks. The male frogs have been heard calling near streams. This frog lays eggs during the time of year when the weather is drier. Scientists think this frog is in some danger of dying out because the place it lives is not very big and because human beings continue to change it in ways that are not good for the frog. For example, the frog is now extinct in some parts of Brazil because people built an artificial lake to store drinking water and flooded the place where the frogs lived. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
