Three human brothers, Kenai, the youngest; Denahi, the middle and Sitka, the elder; return to the tribe to receive totems, necklaces that take the shape of prehistoric creatures, with each animal being representative of something the brothers must achieve to prove themselves as men. Unlike Sitka, who receives the Haast's eagle of guidance, and Denahi, the dire wolf of wisdom, Kenai receives the cave bear of love, to which he objects, believing them to be thieves; he makes his point a fact when a female cave bear steals their basket of fish. Kenai and his brothers pursue her; when the fight culminates on top of a glacier, Sitka sacrifices himself to save his brothers, by dislodging the glacier, but the creature survives. Kenai takes it upon himself to slay her, blaming it for his brother's death. After fighting and slaying the bear, Sitka's spirit appears in the form of a bald eagle, and the Spirits transform Kenai into a cave bear. Denahi arrives and, thinking that the cave bear also killed Kenai, vows to avenge his brother by killing her. Kenai falls down some rapids and is healed by Tanana, the tribal shaman; while she does not speak the bears' language, but advises him to travel to the mountain where Sitka's spirit will turn him back into a human being, but only if he atones for his crime; vanishing without explanation. Kenai discovers he can now communicate with animals, meeting two moose called Rutt and Tuke. He ends up getting caught in a hunter's trap, but is freed by Koda, a sassy cave bear cub. The two strike a deal; in exchange for leading Koda to an annual salmon run, he will take Kenai to the mountain. The two form a brother-like relationship, and Koda reveals his mother is missing. The two are pursued by Denahi, who is out to avenge Kenai; unbeknownst to him, his brother is the bear he is hunting. Upon reaching the salmon run, where several bears congregate, including the leader Tug. Kenai accepts his new surroundings and is comfortable living amongst the bears. During a discussion, Koda tells a story about his mother getting involved in a fight with human hunters; this reminds Kenai of his brothers' fight with the bear, and he realizes, to his horror, that he killed Koda's mother. Horrified by his actions, Kenai runs away in guilt, but Koda follows him. Upset, he confesses to Koda that he killed his mother, and the bear cub runs off in grief; an apologetic Kenai then travels to the mountain on his own. Meanwhile. Rutt and Tuke have a fight, but reconcile with each other in front of Koda, prompting him to forgive Kenai. On the mountain, Kenai is attacked by Denahi, but Koda steals his spear. Out of love for the bear cub, Kenai sacrifices himself, and Sitka's spirit transforms him back into a human, much to the surprise of Koda and Denahi. Upon realizing that the cub needs him due to his own mistakes, Kenai asks to be transformed back into a bear, with Denahi's support. Sitka complies, and transforms his brother back to his bear form, and Koda is briefly reunited with his mother's spirit, before she and Sitka depart to the spirit realm. In the end, Kenai lives with the other bears and gains his title as a man through living as a bear. ==Reception== The reaction from movie reviewers was mixed to negative with many panning the movie as copying older Disney movies like The Lion King and the 20th Century Fox movie Ice Age (although Brother Bear began production before Ice Age did), while others defended the movie as a different and reasonable variation of the theme. The popular American movie critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper have given positive reviews of the movie. However, Brother Bear holds a rating of 38% in Rotten Tomatoes, which says that \"Brother Bear is gentle and pleasant if unremarkable Disney fare, with so-so animation and generic plotting\".http://www.animated-news.com/2003/brother- bear-two-thumbs-up/ Animated News Â» Brother Bear Two Thumbs Up! ==Voice cast== * Joaquin Phoenix as Kenai, the youngest of three brothers who gets turned into a bear, to teach him to see through their eyes * Jeremy Suarez as Koda, a wisecracking grizzly bear cub, who helps Kenai on his journey to where the Lights Touch the Earth * Jason Raize as Denahi, the middle brother ** Harold Gould as Old Denahi (English) ** Angayuqaq Oscar Kawagley as Old Denahi (Inuktitut) * Rick Moranis as Rutt, a comic Canadian moose * Dave Thomas as Tuke, another comic Canadian moose * D.B.
