 "text": "Subic Bay, is a bay on the west coast of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is about 100 kilometers (62 mi) northwest of Manila Bay. The bay is 35 miles (55 km) northwest of the mouth of Manila Bay and extends northward along the Luzon coastline. From 1901 to 1992 the United States operated a naval base, Subic Bay Naval Station, on the southeast coast of the bay. Following the U.S. turnover of the base to the Philippines in 1992, the area was redeveloped as a free-enterprise zone that included establishing a free port and technopark; and converted the naval air base there to an international airport. ==Subic Bay International Airport== Subic Bay International Airport serves as a secondary and diversion airport for the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Metro Manila and the Clark International Airport in Pampanga. ==References== ==Other websites== Map of Subic Bay Subic Bay Port Facilities Exploring the Philippines: Freeports and Special Economic Zones Category:Bays of the Philippines Category:Ports and harbours of the Philippines",
