 "text": "Chewing gum is a type of candy flavored with natural sugar or artificial sweeteners and also flavors such as mint. Gum is made to be chewed, and not swallowed. People chew gum for personal enjoyment and also to help clean teeth. Before it is chewed, the gum comes either soft and chewy or hard and then softens in your mouth. People are usually finished with gum once all the flavor is extracted, or their mouth becomes sore. Once people are done with gum, they throw it away. == History == Chewing gum was invented at least 5000 years ago and in many places, made from many different plants.
