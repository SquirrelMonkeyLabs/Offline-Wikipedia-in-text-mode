 "text": "The Dauphin was the heir apparent to the throne of France from 1350–1791, and from 1824–1830. ==History== Guy VIII, Count of Vienne, had a dolphin on his coat of arms and had been nicknamed le Dauphin (French for dolphin). The title of Dauphin of Viennois descended in his family until 1349, when Humbert II sold his signeurie, called the Dauphiné, to King Philippe VI on condition that the heir of France assumed the title of le Dauphin and govern this territory.Roland Mousnier, The Institutions of France Under the Absolute Monarchy, 1598-1789, Vol. 2 (Chicago; London: University of Chicago, 1984), p. 4 The Dauphin retained the title only.Encyclopædia Americana, Vol. 4, eds. Francis Lieber; Edward Wigglesworth; Thomas Gamaliel Bradford (Philadelphia: Carey, Lea & Carey, 1830), p. 129 The estates belonged to the crown. On the death of the Dauphin, his eldest son inherits the title. If there is no son, his oldest brother succeeds him. If the king does not have a son the title does not go to anyone. It is never given to a brother of the king. The wife of the Dauphin was known as the Dauphine. The first French Dauphin was Charles V. The title is roughly equivalent to the English title Prince of Wales. The Dauphin was entitled to the use of the style of Royal Highness but this was only ever used in written form. The title of Dauphin of Auvergne was used by the Count of Clermont. == Dauphins of France, 1349–1830 == # Charles V of France 1349–1364 # Charles, eldest son and heir of Charles V; future Charles VI 1368–1380 # Charles 1389 # Charles 1392–1401 # Louis, 1401–1415 # John, 1415–1417 # Charles VII of France 1417–1422 # Louis XI of France 1423–1461 # Charles VIII of France 1470–1483 # Edward of Middleham (disputed) 1483–1484 # Charles Orland 1492–1495 # Charles 1496 # François 1497–1498 # François 1518–1536 # Henry II of France 1536–1547 # Francis II of France 1547–1559 # Louis XIII of France 1601–1610 # Louis XIV of France 1638–1643 # Louis, Grand Dauphin 1661–1711 # Louis, Petit Dauphin 1711-1712 # Louis 1712 # Louis XV of France 1712–1715 # Louis 1729–1765 # Louis XVI of France 1765–1774 # Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France 1781–1789 # Louis XVII of France 1789–1791 (in 1791 his title was changed to \"Prince Royal\") # Louis XIX of France 1824–1830 ==Related pages== *Prince of Wales *Titles of European royal heirs == References == Category:Ranks in the old Kingdom of France Category:Titles in the old Kingdom of France",
