 "text": "Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of the Islamist group al-Qaeda, was killed in Afghanistan on July 31, 2022. The strike came nearly a year after the conclusion of the War in Afghanistan. U.S. officials called al-Zawahiri's presence in Afghanistan a violation of the agreement for the withdrawal of American forces from the country, under which the Taliban would not allow al- Qaeda members any sanctuary. Following the strike, members of the Haqqani network tried to cover up al-Zawahiri's death, although the U.S. was able to confirm it. In response to the strike, Biden released a statement announcing al-Zawahiri's death, calling it a \"deliverance of justice\". ==References== Category:2022 deaths Category:July events Category:Joe Biden Category:2020s in Afghanistan",
