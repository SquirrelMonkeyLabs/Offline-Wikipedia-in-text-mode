The chocolate bar was first created sometime in the early 1900s by the Lowney Chocolate Factory in Canada. It was given the name Eat- More by New Waterford, Nova Scotia resident Angus B. MacDonald and is advertised with the slogan \"A Real Long Chew\". On May 1, 1995, Hershey Canada announced that they were releasing a caramel flavour called Eat-More Caramel. They do not make Eat-More Caramel anymore. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:Canadian food Category:Chocolate bars",
