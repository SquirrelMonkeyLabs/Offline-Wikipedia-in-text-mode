 "text": "\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" is a song from the 1967 album by The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was composed mainly by John Lennon with input from Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon/McCartney. ==Inspiration== Lennon wrote the song taking inspiration from a nineteenth century circus poster for Pablo Fanque's circus which he purchased in an antique shop on 31 January 1967 while filming the promotional video for the song \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in Kent. Lennon said that \"Everything from the song is from that poster, except the horse wasn't called Henry.\" (The poster idenitifies the horse as \"Zanthus\".) Mr. Kite is believed to be William Kite, who worked for Pablo Fanque from 1843 to 1845. ==Personnel== *John Lennon: double-tracked lead vocals and harmony vocals; Hammond organ; tape loops and harmonica. *Paul McCartney: lead guitar and bass. *George Harrison: piano and tambourine. *Ringo Starr: drums; tambourine; and harmonica. *George Martin: harmonium, Lowrey organ, glockenspiel and tape loops. *Mal Evans: harmonica. *Neil Aspinall: harmonica. *Geoff Emerick: tape loops. ==Notes== ==Other websites== * * * * Category:The Beatles songs Category:1967 songs",
