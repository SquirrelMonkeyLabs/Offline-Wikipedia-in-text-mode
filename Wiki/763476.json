 "text": "David Waisman Rjavinsthi (born 4 May 1937) is a former Peruvian politician who was the First Vice President of Peru from 2004 to 2006 under President Alejandro Toledo. Previously, he was the Second Vice President of Peru from 2001 to 2004 also under Alejandro Toledo, a member of Possible Peru until the party was dissolved in 2017, and also a Congressman from 2000 to 2011. == Political career == On 28 July 2001, Waisman became Second Vice President of Peru in Alejandro Toledo's government. He was in office from 2001 to 2004. On 14 December 2004, the First Vice President of Peru, Raúl Diez Canseco, resigned from office and thus, Waisman became the First Vice President until 28 July 2006. === 2006 elections === In 2006, he was initially appointed by Possible Peru as a presidential candidate but independent Jeanette Emmanuel later replaced him as Perú Posible's candidate. With her withdrawal, Rafael Belaúnde was appointed as the new candidate, but he also withdrew. He instead ran for Congress, and was successfully re-elected as one of the only 2 congressman from Perú Posible, aside from Carlos Bruce. === 2011 elections === He is considering running for Vice President once more in the upcoming early 2011 elections alongside Luis Castañeda, after having switched from Perú Posible due to irreconcilable differences with Toledo, to Partido Solidaridad Nacional. He lost his Congressional seat consequently. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:Vice presidents of Peru Category:Living people",
