 "text": "Clinical lycanthropy is a condition from psychiatry. People affected either think they can transform into an animal, or that they are transforming into an animal, or that they are an animal. This is of course a false idea. Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. It is purported to be a rare disorder. If it occurs, the condition occurs with mental disoreders that involve psychosis or hallucinations, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or clinical depression. Usually, treating the underlying condition (for example with antipsychotics) also make this condition go away. == References == Category:Psychosis",
