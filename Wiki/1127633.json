 "text": "Room for Improvement is the first mixtape by Canadian rapper Drake. Room for Improvement was released on February 14, 2006. During an interview with thebiz, Drake would reveal Room for Improvement as the title of his mixtape. He would talk about working with producer DJ Smallz, who also worked with rappers such as Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy. Drake had created an entirely different album at first but it was never released because the computer that they were recording it on got a virus and crashed so they had lost all their work. When working on the mixtape somebody had broken into their studio but did not take anything. Drake would re-release the mixtape in 2008. In 2018, a notebook that featured handwritten lyrics written for the album by Drake appeared up for auction. It features the songs \"Special\", \"Do Me So Good\", \"Try Harder\", \"City Is Mine\", \"Do What You Do\", \"A Scorpio's Mind\" and \"Bad Meaning Good\". ==Songs== ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Drake (musician) albums Category:Mixtape albums",
