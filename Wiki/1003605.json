 "text": "Tromsø Cathedral is a church in Tromsø, Norway. It is made of wood and was built in 1861 in the Gothic Revival style by Christian Heinrich Grosch. The cathedral has a tower and a main entrance on the west side. It can seat 618 people but originally had almost 1000 seats. Tromsø Cathedral is important because it is the only cathedral in Norway made of wood. It is also the most northern Protestant cathedral in the world. The first church on the site was built in 1252 by King Haakon IV. Not much is known about the previous churches, but it is likely that there has been a church on the site since the 13th century. The present cathedral was consecrated in 1861 and cost about 10,000 Speciedalers to build. The interior of the cathedral is decorated with a copy of the painting \"Resurrection\" by Adolph Tidemand and stained glass windows designed by Gustav Vigeland. == References == Category:Churches in Tromsø",
