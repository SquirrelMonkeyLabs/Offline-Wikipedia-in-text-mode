 "text": "GJ 1061 is a red dwarf star located 12 light years from Earth in the constellation of Horologium. Even though it is a nearby star, it has an apparent magnitude of about 13, so it can only be seen with at least a medium- sized telescope. The proper motion of GJ 1061 has been known since 1974, but it was thought to be further away at 25 light years based upon an estimated parallax of 0.130â€³. The RECONS accurately decided its distance in 1997. At that time, it was the 20th-nearest star system to the Sun. The discovery team noted that many more stars like this are likely to be discovered nearby. This star is a small, dim, red dwarf, close to the lower mass limit. It has an estimated mass of about 12.5% that of the Sun and is only about 0.2% as luminous. The star shows no major infrared excess due to circumstellar dust. == Planetary system == On August 13, 2019, a planetary system was announced orbiting the star GJ 1061 by the Red Dots project for finding terrestrial planets around nearby red dwarf stars. The planet GJ 1061 d orbits in the habitable zone of its star at around 0.054 AU and the planet GJ 1061 c orbits in the inner edge of the habitable zone at 0.035 AU. GJ 1061 b is the closest planet to its star at just 0.021 AU. GJ 1061 is a non-variable star that does not have flares, so there is a greater chance that the exoplanets still have their atmosphere if they had one. == References == 1061",
