 "text": "Versus EP is the first extended play by American singer Usher. It was released on August 24, 2010 on LaFace Records and Jive Records. It was produced by Polow da Don, Jim Jonsin, Rico Love, Drumma Boy, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Tha Cornaboyz and Max Martin. Versus was the \"last chapter of Raymond v. Raymond\". The songs talked about Usher being a single father. The EP debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. It sold 46,000 copies the first week. It became Usher's sixth top-ten album in the United States. The album released two singles. These include \"Hot Tottie\" and \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\". Versus reached the top-20 in Canada, top-30 in France, top-40 in Germany, Belgium, and on the Dutch Albums Chart. Many music critics did not like that album was a \"pop\" album. However, it was given most positive reviews. == Track listing == ==Personnel== Credits for Versus from Allmusic.[ Credits: Versus]. Allmusic.
