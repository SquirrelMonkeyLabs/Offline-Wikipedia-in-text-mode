 "text": "Gili Trawangan is the largest of Lombok's Gili Islands. It is the only one to rise notably above sea level. It is long and wide. The island has a population of about 1000 people. Of the Gilis, Trawangan has the most tourist facilities. The pub Tîr na Nôg says that Trawangan is the smallest island in the world with an Irish pub. The most crowded part of Trawangan is on the eastern side. On Gili Trawangan (as well as the other two Gilis), there are no motorized vehicles. The main means of transportation are bicycles (rented by the people who live on the island to tourists) and cidomo (a small horse pulled carriage). For traveling to and from each of the Gilis, motorized boats and speedboats are used. Some of the first people to live on Gili Trawangan were from Sulawesi. They were fishermen and farmers. Before they came to Gili Trawangan, the island was covered in forest and deer lived there. The economy of Gili Trawangan centres on tourism. The island is too small to support large amounts of agriculture. It is also too far away from other places to be useful for either industry or commerce. ==Related pages== * Gili Meno * Gili Air Category:Lesser Sunda Islands Category:Lombok",
