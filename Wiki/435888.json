 "text": "Inline skating is a kind of skating. It involves a person moving across land using shoes that have wheels on the bottom. It is similar to roller skating, except that the wheels are smaller and are in a single line. Inline skating is also called rollerblading, after the Rollerblade brand of skates. . Inline skates usually have between 2 and 5 polyurethane wheels. These wheels are arranged in a single line. This allows for faster speeds than roller skates. Category:Skating",
