 "text": "Rugby boys (sometimes called solvent boys) is the name for gangs of street children in the Philippines. There are a well-known sign of poverty there. They can be found in many slums. They often use and are addicted to an adhesive called Rugby, which gives them their name. They use this against hunger. Rugby is cheap, and easy to get. For this reason, many street children are addicted to it. Often, rugby boys will commit crimes such as robbery to get the money needed to get the adhesive. The formula for the adhesive has also been changed, ot make sniffing it less attractive. The problem is that sniffing solvents causes permanent damage to organs organs such as the liver, kidneys, brain, and heart. The phenomenon is not limited to boys, it also affects girls. Children usually begin sniffing because of peer pressure, they see other people doing it. Category:Street children",
