 "text": "Patricia Sue Summitt (née Head; June 14, 1952 – June 28, 2016) was an American college basketball head coach. During her career, she won 1,098 games. They are the most in NCAA basketball history. She was born in Clarksville, Tennessee. She served as the head coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team from 1974 to 2012, before retiring at age 59 because of a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She won eight NCAA championships (a NCAA women's record when she retired), a number surpassed only by the 10 titles won by UCLA men's coach John Wooden and the 11 titles won by UConn women's coach Geno Auriemma. She was the first NCAA coach, and one of four college coaches overall, with at least 1,000 wins. Summitt died at a retirement home on June 28, 2016 from dementia in Knoxville, Tennessee, aged 64. ==References== ==Other websites== * Pat Summitt Foundation Category:1952 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Deaths from dementia Category:Disease- related deaths in Tennessee Category:People with Alzheimer's disease Category:College basketball coaches Category:Sportspeople from Tennessee Category:Writers from Tennessee Category:People from Clarksville, Tennessee Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees",
