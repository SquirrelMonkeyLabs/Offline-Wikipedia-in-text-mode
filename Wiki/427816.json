 "text": "A peaking power plant (or peaker) is a power station that only runs during peak hours of demand of electricity. Because of that, the price of electricity it generates is generally higher than the electricity generated by base load power plant, which operates continuously throughout the year. Peak hours may include hot afternoons when air conditioners are working. Examples of peaking power plants are a hydropower plant, pumped-storage hydro power plant, and gas-fired power plant. Nuclear and solar power are not used in this way. Peaker plants have been replaced with battery storage in some places. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) is seeking to replace gas peaker plants with battery storage, 142 Tesla Megapacks (storng 100 MWh) replaced a gas peaker plant in Ventura County, California and in Lessines, Belgium 40 Tesla Megapacks (50 MWh) replaced a turbojet generator. Australia's Clean Energy Council found in April 2021 that battery storage can be 30% cheaper than gas peaker plants. ==Related pages== * Load following power plant == References == Category:Electricity",
