 "text": "The Federal Ministry of Justice is a ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany. == History == Germany has five \"Classic Ministries\", rather like the United Kingdom's \"Great Offices of State\". The classic ministries are: * Justice * Interior * Finance * Defence (or \"War\" as it was called before World War II) and * the Foreign Office The Reich Justice Office was created in 1875. It was a part of the Chancellor's department until 1 January 1877 when it became independent. The first Minister of Justice was appointed in 1919, when the Office of Justice became the Reichsministerium der Justiz of the Weimar Republic == Responsibility == === Political === The Federal Minister of Justice heads the Ministry. He has two senior assistants. * The Parliamentary State Secretary, a member of the Bundestag who acts as a \"junior minister\" * The \"beamteter Staatssekret채r\". This is the senior civil servant of the department. === Role === Germany is a federal country. The administration of the justice and criminal prosecution is mainly a matter for the federal states. The federal ministry's main job is ensuring that federation and the states, and all laws, keep within the \"Rule of Law\". The ministry oversees the writing of new laws, and the changing or the abolition of existing laws in these areas: * Civil law * Criminal law * Commercial and Company law * Copyright and protecting industrial property rights * Organisation and procedures of the courts (except the Labour and Social Security Courts) The ministry also oversees the laws about qualifying and working as a judge, prosecutor, lawyer or notary The ministry has also been responsible for the legal problems after the reunification of Germany. This meant changing a lot of criminal and administrative law. Also professional rehabilitation was needed. Judges and lawyers were just some of the people who were used to working in the communist system, and now had to change. Furthermore, the ministry checks that all laws and ordinances prepared by other ministries do not break the constitution. The Ministry publishes the official newspaper the \"Bundesgesetzblatt\" the Federal Law Gazette und \"Bundesanzeiger\" the Federal Gazette. It also prepares the elections of Judges to the Bundesverfassungsgerichts and the highest level of federal courts. == List of Justice Ministers == Federal Ministers of Justice since 1949 Federal Ministers of Justice since 1949 Federal Ministers of Justice since 1949 Federal Ministers of Justice since 1949 Federal Ministers of Justice since 1949 Federal Ministers of Justice since 1949 Party No Name Life data Term start Term end FDP 1 Thomas Dehler 1897-1967 20 September 1949 20 October 1953 FDP 2 Fritz Neumayer 1884-1973 20 October 1953 16 October 1956 DP 3 Hans-Joachim von Merkatz 1905-1982 16 October 1956 29 October 1957 CSU 4 Fritz Sch채ffer 1888-1967 29 October 1957 14 November 1961 FDP 5 Wolfgang Stammberger 1920-1982 14 November 1961 19 November 1962 FDP/DVP 6 Ewald Bucher 1914-1991 13 December 1962 27 March 1965 CDU 7 Karl Weber 1898-1985 1 April 1965 26 October 1965 CSU 8 Richard Jaeger 1913-1998 26 October 1965 30 November 1966 SPD 9 Gustav Heinemann 1899-1976 1 December 1966 26 March 1969 SPD 10 Horst Ehmke 1927-2017 26 March 1969 21 October 1969 SPD 11 Gerhard Jahn 1927-1998 22 October 1969 7 May 1974 SPD 12 Hans-Jochen Vogel 1926-2020 16 May 1974 22 January 1981 SPD 13 J체rgen Schmude 1936- 22 January 1981 1 October 1982 FDP 14 Hans A.
