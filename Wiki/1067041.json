 "text": "Live Action at ROCK ALL, Oslo is a live EP by Brainbombs. It was released in 1994 by Big Ball Records in Norway, then re-released on the \"Singles Compilation\" in 1999. The performance has Jonas, the guitarist, on vocals rather than their usual vocalist, Peter. The band also had to get recording engineer, Birger Thorburn to play as a backup guitarist as Jonas could not sing and play at the same time. The band plays each song faster in tempo than their studio versions, except for Stacy, which is an unreleased song. According to Jonas, there were around 54 people in attendance. Jonas has also said this is not the full concert, as \"David\" for Big Ball Records said some songs were \"too muffled.\" From the two concerts, songs \"Urge to Kill\", \"Danny Was a Streetwhore\", \"Stacy\" (different version) and \"Tired and Bloody\" were later released on the 2007 compilation, Brainbombs. == Track listing == === Side one === # \"No Guilt\" - 1:44 # \"Wishing a Slow Death\" - 03:12 === Side two === # \"Stacy\" - 02:28 # \"Burning Hell\" - 02:17 == Personnel == * Jonas Tiljander - vocals * Birger Thorburn - guitar * Lanchy Orre - guitar * Drajan Bryngelsson - drums == References == Category:1994 EPs Category:1994 albums Category:Rock albums Category:Brainbombs albums",
