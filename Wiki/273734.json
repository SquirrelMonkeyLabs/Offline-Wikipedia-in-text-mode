It offers television and broadband Internet services in the United Kingdom. ==History== ===Origins=== The present service can trace its heritage back to 1990, when BSkyB's predecessors British Satellite Broadcasting encrypted their respective film channels â€“ Sky Movies and The Movie Channel which required viewers to get decoding equipment and a subscription to watch the channels. After the two companies merged, subscribers could get access to both channels, and two years later, the sports channel Sky Sports also became encrypted. == Related pages == *Sky Sports *Sky News ==References== Category:1990 establishments in the United Kingdom",
