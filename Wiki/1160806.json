 "text": "The Russian Revolution of 1905 is also called the First Russian Revolution. It started on January 22, 1905, with many protests and unrest across the Russian Empire. This unrest led to the creation of a constitutional monarchy with the Russian Constitution of 1906. Many different groups were unhappy and took action, including workers on strike, peasants revolting, and soldiers mutinying. These actions were against Tsar Nicholas II, the nobility, and the ruling class. Because of the pressure, they had to make changes, such as creating the State Duma (a legislative body) and allowing a multi-party system. == Reasons for the Revolution == # Unhappy Peasants: Poor peasants were angry because their landlords treated them badly and the old semi-feudal system continued. # Russo-Japanese War: Russia lost the war against Japan, which made people more upset. # Economic Problems: A recession starting in 1899 led to many people in cities losing their jobs. == Key Events == * Bloody Sunday (1905): On January 22, 1905, workers marched peacefully to the tsar's Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. The guards shot at them, causing many deaths and injuries. * Widespread Protests: Demonstrations and strikes spread across the empire, but the tsar's troops violently suppressed them. * Potemkin Mutiny: In June, sailors on the battleship Potemkin revolted. * General Strike: In October, railway workers went on strike, which grew into a general strike in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. The striking workers formed councils, like the St. Petersburg Soviet of Workers' Deputies, to discuss their plans. == References == Category:1905 Revolution of 1905",
