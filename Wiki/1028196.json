 "text": "A hunting bag is a bag used by the hunter to transport his equipment, his food and hunting accessories, e.g. cartridges, etc. It is usually a medium size bag since it is also used to carry captured pieces. Made of leather or fabric, the satchel is generaly equipped with a large strap passed around the neck to hang it over the shoulder. There are hunting jackets with an integrated pouch on the back. Le Chasseur français, n° 646, décembre 1950, page 706. == Description == Hunting bags are traditionally made of strong leather and worn over the shoulder on a wide strap. They are rectangular in shape and contain compartments for small items, which are protected by the bag's lid, which is usually large. There are strings usually attached to it, (sometimes with rings in its end) to hang dead birds. For short-term hunts, the so-called American hunting bags, which have a square-round-oblong shape, are the most convenient. == References == == Bibliography == * Ягдаш // Энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона :v 86 t.
