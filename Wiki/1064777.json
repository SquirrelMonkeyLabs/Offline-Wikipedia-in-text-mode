 "text": "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (English: \"It is different, [yet] it is one\") is Indonesia's official national motto. It's written on the emblem of Indonesia, called the Garuda Pancasila. The phrase means \"Unity in Diversity\" in Old Javanese. This motto is also in Indonesia's Constitution, in article 36A. It talks about Indonesia being united and whole even though it has many cultures, languages, ethnicities, religions, and beliefs. The words come from an Old Javanese poem called Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular, a famous poet in Javanese Literature during the time of the Majapahit empire in the 14th century. King RƒÅjasanagara, also known as Hayam Wuruk, was ruling then. == References == Category:National symbols of Indonesia Category:Mottos",
