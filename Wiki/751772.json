 "text": "The Sicilian Mafia, also known as simply the Mafia and also know by its members as Cosa Nostra (), is an Italian, Mafia-terrorist-type, organized crime syndicate. It began in Sicily. The basic group is known as a \"family\", \"clan\", or cosca. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood of a larger city. Its members call themselves \"men of honour\", although the public often calls them as mafiosi. The Mafia often did protection racketeering, \"fixed\" problems between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. ==References== Category:Mafia Category:Sicily",
