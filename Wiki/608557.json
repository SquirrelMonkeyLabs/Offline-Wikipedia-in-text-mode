 "text": "Hindus believe in one main God, Brahman. Most Hindus believe he is present in every person as the eternal spirit or soul, called the atman. For Hindus there is a sacred symbol that represents their belief. Om (or Aum) is the sound to represent their God. There is a Trimurti in the Hindu belief: Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer. Hindus also believe that sometimes God may appear on earth in living form.
