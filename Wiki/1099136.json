 "text": "On the 13th of April 1945, the town of Zwolle was liberated from under Nazi Germany by a single Canadian soldier called Léo Major. == History == === Before the liberation === Earlier in the war, Léo Major had already taken part in multiple one-man combats against large groups of Germans. During the Normandy landings he single handedly captured an armored vehicle and found a secret German hideout. At one point during the war he was on a scouting mission, and discovered approximately 100 German men at a camp. Major walked through the canal and woke up the German officer to tell his men to surrender. As they were walking, another camp saw him and opened fire until an allied tank showed up. === Liberating Zwolle === Major and his friend Welly Arsenault were sent on a mission to Zwolle to liberate the town. Arsenault died in the effort. Major used machine guns and grenades to make the Germans think an entire allied army was attacking. Four hours later the Germans retreated and Major contacted the Dutch resistance to tell them Zwolle was liberated. Category:1945 in Europe Category:World War II Category:Overijssel",
