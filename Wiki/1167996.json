 "text": "Operation Ngayau III, which took place in October 1971 in the Bintangor, involved a platoon from Company A of the 1st Battalion Rangers. Led by Captain Welther Wong, the platoon was sent to track down a communist guerrilla group based on local intelligence. After several days in the jungle, they were ambushed near an abandoned hut in the Sungai Kedup area. The ambush began around 6 am, with the communist guerrilla launching an attack. The Rangers fought back and managed to force the guerrillas to retreat. During the battle, five communists were killed, but the Rangers also suffered casualties: Ranger Nyambong Ak Bansa was killed, and three others were injured. Ranger Unggek Ak Anti played a heroic role, despite being wounded, by killing two communists and dragging their bodies to the road. For their bravery, Sergeant Joseph Mileng, Corporal Dajai Ak Anggie, and Ranger Unggek Ak Anti received Pingat Gagah Berani on December 23, 1971. == References == Category:History of Malaysia",
