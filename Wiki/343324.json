 "text": "Singapore Standard Time (abbreviation: SST; ) or Singapore Time (abbreviation: SIN; ) is the time zone used in Singapore, 8 hours ahead of UTC (UTC+08:00). == History == Singapore is situated 103Â° 51' 16\" East of Greenwich and lies within the UTC+07:00 time zone. Before 31 May 1905, the local time was UTC+06:55:25 ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. During World War II, when the Japanese occupied Singapore, UTC+09:00 was used, to follow Japan time, while UTC+07:20 and UTC+07:30 were used for daylight saving time. When Peninsular Malaysia moved its standard time 30 minutes ahead from UTC+07:30 to UTC+08:00 on 31 December 1981, Singapore shifted too. The city state started using UTC+08:00 on 1 January 1982 and the country celebrated New Year's Day half an hour earlier. == Other websites == * Why is Singapore in the \"Wrong\" Time Zone? *Singapore Standard Time * National Metrology Centre Singapore Category:Singapore",
