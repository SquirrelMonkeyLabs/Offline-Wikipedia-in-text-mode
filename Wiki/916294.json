 "text": "James is a fictional anthropomorphic tender locomotive from The Railway Series children's books by the Reverend Awdry and its TV adaptation Thomas and Friends and its reboot Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go!. He is a mixed- traffic engine, which means he is just as capable of pulling coaches as well as trucks. He has a 2-6-0 (\"Mogul\") wheel arrangement and is engine number 5 on the North Western Railway, the Fat Controller's railway on the Island of Sodor. James first appeared in The Railway Series in 1946, in the book Thomas the Tank Engine. Two books in the series, no. 3 James the Red Engine and no. 28 James and the Diesel Engines, are dedicated to James. ==References== Category:Railway Series characters",
