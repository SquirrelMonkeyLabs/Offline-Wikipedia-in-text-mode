 "text": "Peeps are marshmallows sold in the United States and Canada. They are shaped like ducks, bunnies, and other animals. There are also different shapes used for many holidays. Peeps are used to fill Easter baskets. In recent years, they have been advertised as \"Peeps - Always in Season\". They are now used to celebrate Halloween, Christmas and Valentine's Day. They are made from sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, various food dyes (never blue dye), and a pinch of salt. ==References== Category:Candy",
