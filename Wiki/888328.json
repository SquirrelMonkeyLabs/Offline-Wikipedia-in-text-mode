GAM 007932) it is a work of social denunciation of the human condition. The work analyzes the exploitation of man, through iconography Bardi configures the protagonists who dominate society and the world, a feudal, pre-Enlightenment world, derided by laws and customs that are ironic when not ferocious of repression. Which still survives in a predatory way hiding behind the tempting masks of hypocrisy. Mario Bardi's message rings alive and legitimate, innervating his painting.Carlo Munari, Gianni Vianello, \"Arte moderna italiana: dal liberty al comportamentismo\", Ed.
