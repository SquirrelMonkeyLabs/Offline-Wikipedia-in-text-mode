 "text": "Bjelovar-Bilogora County (; ) is a county in central Croatia. The town of Bjelovar was first mentioned in historical records in 1413. It became important when a fort was built in 1756 to defend against the Ottoman Empire, who often invaded Croatia. A hill, Bilogora, is along the northern edge of the county. Thus the name comes from the two important features in the county, Bjelovar and Bilogora. Other towns in the county are Daruvar, Garešnica, Čazma and Grubišno Polje. The Bjelovar-Bilogora County borders on Koprivnica- Križevci County in the north, Virovitica-Podravina County in the northeast, Požega-Slavonia County in the southeast, Sisak-Moslavina County in the southwest and Zagreb County in the west. ==Administrative division== Bjelovar- Bilogora County is divided into 5 towns and 18 municipalities.
