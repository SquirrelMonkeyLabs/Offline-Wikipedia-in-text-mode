 "text": ":For another species commonly known as the red-eyed tree frog, see Agalychnis callidryas Ranoidea chloris, commonly known as the red-eyed tree frog or orange-eyed tree frog, is a frog from eastern Australia. It lives in forests, wetlands and sometimes cities. Adult frogs look for food at night and spend most of their time in trees. They lay their eggs in permanent or temporary bodies of water, so the tadpoles must grow into frogs quickly or they will die when their homes dry up. The tadpoles start out yellow but become green as they grow. Red-eyed tree frog tadpoles can jump out of the water to catch flying insects. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
