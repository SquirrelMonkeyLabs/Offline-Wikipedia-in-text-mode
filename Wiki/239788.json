 "text": "Ixnay on the Hombre is the fourth album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 1997. This was their first album released on the major label Columbia Records (however, in Europe, it was released on Epitaph) and also its first collaboration with record producer Dave Jerden, who would produce the band's next album Americana (1998). Even though the album did not maintain the same popularity as Smash, Ixnay on the Hombre was well received by both critics and fans, selling more than 5.5 million copies worldwide, and being certified platinum by the RIAA. ==Track listing== # \"Disclaimer\" – 0:44 # \"The Meaning of Life\" – 2:55 # \"Mota\" – 2:56 # \"Me & My Old Lady\" – 4:31 # \"Cool to Hate\" – 2:47 # \"Leave It Behind\" – 1:56 # \"Gone Away\" – 4:27 # \"I Choose\" – 3:53 # \"Intermission\" – 0:48 # \"All I Want\" – 1:54 # \"Way Down the Line\" – 2:35 # \"Don't Pick It Up\" – 1:52 # \"Amazed\" – 4:25 # \"Change the World\" – 6:23 ==Personnel== ;The Offspring *Dexter Holland – guitar, vocals *Greg K. – bass guitar *Noodles – guitar, backing vocals *Ron Welty – drums ;Additional musicians *Jello Biafra – Vocals on \"Disclaimer\" *Calvert DeForest – Vocals on \"Kiss My Ass\"/\"Cocktail\" *Jason \"Blackball\" McLean – Additional Vocals on \"Mota\" *Paulinho Da Costa – Additional percussion *Dexter, Noodles and Davey Havok (credited as Davey Havoc) – Backing Vocals ;Others *Dave Jerden – Production and mixing *Bryan Carlstrom – Engineering *Brian Jerden – Assistant engineering *Annette Cisneros – Assistant engineering *Eddy Schreyer – Mastering *Bryan Hall – Guitar Tech *Sean Evans – Art Direction *Enrique Chagoya – Cover illustration *Lisa Haun – Photography ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:The Offspring albums Category:Punk albums",
