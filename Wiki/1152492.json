 "text": "Svensk uppslagsbok is a Swedish encyclopedia published from 1929 to 1955, in two versions. == First edition == The first edition began in 1929 by Baltiska förlaget AB, but in 1931, Svensk uppslagsbok AB took over the publishing. This edition had 30 volumes and one extra volume, finishing in 1937. The articles in Svensk uppslagsbok were written by experts and were signed. It competed with Nordisk familjebok in its shorter version (1923–1937) and aimed to be affordable for many people. == Second edition == A new, updated edition was released from 1947 to 1955 and had 32 volumes. The publisher Svensk uppslagsbok AB changed its name to Förlagshuset Norden AB in 1945. For the rest of the 1950s and until the early 1970s, only smaller Swedish encyclopedia projects were started. The second edition of Svensk uppslagsbok was the last big Swedish-language encyclopedia until the first edition of Bra böckers lexikon came out in 1973–1981, and its size was only matched when Nationalencyklopedin was published in 1989–1996. == References == Category:Encyclopedias Category:Non-fiction books",
