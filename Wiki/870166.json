Bismillah is the abbreviated version of the phrase. Every chapter in the Qur'an, the Muslim holy book, starts with the Basmalah, other than chapter 9, which is called Surah At-Tawbah. It is also known from the hadith that the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, used to say the shorter form, \"Bismillah\", before starting any work, such as eating. In many works there are instructions to say or write \"Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem\". In legal terms, even if it is not mandatory, it is still Mustahab, meaning desirable of benificent. == Other websites == * Bismillahirrahmanirrahim * Bismillah Samples, a collection of bismillah art- forms. * Bismillah in Tadabbur-i-Qur'an. * Meaning of Bismillah * Beyond Probability, God's Message in Mathematics.
