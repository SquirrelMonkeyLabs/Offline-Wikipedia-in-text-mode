 "text": "On March 18, 1921, the Soviet occupation of Ukraine began, without any invasion between those two countries. The occupation only began once the Peace treaty of Riga was signed. The peace treaty declared that the Polishâ€“Soviet War would come to a halt, and the Soviet Union would get Belarus and Ukraine. The occupation lasted almost 81 years, and only ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. ==Related pages== * Holodomor * Double genocide theory * Genocides by the Soviet Union Category:History of Ukraine Category:History of the Soviet Union Category:Soviet crimes against humanity",
