The college was officially created due to a successful county election in March 1967. The campus was made possible in 1969 after Johnson County voters approved $12.9 million to be used to buy 200 acres of land in Overland Park. Construction started in 1970. Classes were moved to the new campus in the fall 1972. ==Academics== JCCC has many undergraduate credit courses that are similar to the first two years of most college curricula.
