 "text": "In the Wake of the Bounty is an Australian movie directed by Charles Chauvel. It is the first movie of Errol Flynn. It is based on the 1932 novel Mutiny on the Bounty by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. The Australian movie was made two years before MGM's more famous Mutiny on the Bounty. The movie mixed re-enactments with documentary. It focused not so much on the mutiny itself as on what happened afterwards.Curators notes at Australian Screen ==References== Category:1933 drama movies Category:1933 adventure movies Category:Australian adventure movies Category:Australian drama movies Category:Movies based on books Category:1930s historical movies Category:Mutiny on the Bounty",
