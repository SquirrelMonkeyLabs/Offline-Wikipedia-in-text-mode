Retrieved 2024-09-04 == Pogrom == On 30 June 1941, the Wehrmacht German officers occupied Lviv, Ukraine. The German name for Lviv is Lemberg. Persecution of Jews began almost immediately, within just hours of the occupation, but ultimately a month later, a full- blown pogrom took place in Lviv. About 3000 to 7000 Jews were forced out of their homes, forced to do all sorts of forced labor, and were treated with great violence and also were humiliated and mocked greatly for the German officers' amusement and entertainment, in various forms. They were then sent in groups to newly-built Lwów Ghetto, and were forced to live in barracks, and used for forced labor, and then just mostly shot and killed there, in dug-up pits. == References == == Other websites == Category:1240s establishments in Europe Category:Capital cities in Europe",
