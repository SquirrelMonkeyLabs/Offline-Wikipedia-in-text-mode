The changes could range from just more detailed art, to a whole new story. It may change the theme or target audience. A remake may change some parts of the plot. For example, the 1968 movie The Thomas Crown Affair is centered on a bank robbery. The 1999 remake involves the theft of a valuable painting. A lot of times, a remake changes graphics and art. == Live Action Remakes (animation) == Recently, a lot of big movie studios like Disney have been remaking successful animated movies into live action ones. They usually do this because it's an easy way to make money, though lots of people don't like how studios make remakes instead of new movies. Even though they're called live action remakes, they often use a lot of CGI. The idea of live action remakes was popularized by Disney after The Lion King 2019 grossed over 5 million dollars. Usually, live action remakes also change the actors. Sometimes, they also make minor plot changes. They usually are very similar in scripts, music, sets, and plot. == References == Category:Movie remakes",
