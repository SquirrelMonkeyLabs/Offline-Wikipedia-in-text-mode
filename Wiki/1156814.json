 "text": "Dangerfield is a British television medical drama series, first broadcast on BBC One, which described the activities of small-town doctor and police surgeon Paul Dangerfield, played by Nigel Le Vaillant. The series places particular emphasis on Dangerfield's constant struggle to manage the conflicting demands of his two jobs, to come to terms with the death of his wife Celia in a car accident a few years earlier, and to bring up his two initially teenaged, but later grown up, children, Alison and Marty. Six series of the program were produced, broadcasting from 27 January 1995 until 19 November 1999. After Le Vaillant left the role in 1997, Dr. Jonathan Paige, played by Nigel Havers, became the new central character, after previously appearing in the final two episodes of Le Vaillant's tenure. The BBC decided to end the series in November 1999 when Havers announced his decision to quit. The BBC felt viewers would not find the series credible if the main character was changed for a second time. The show, like a number of other BBC dramas of the 1980s and 1990s, also featured a number of borderline fantasy episodes. These included \"Tricks\", \"Angel\" and \"Haunted\". The TV trailers for Dangerfield were heavily parodied by The Fast Show, in which the character was called Monkfish and would appear as a tough uncompromising Doctor, Policeman, vet and even as an interior designer – with titles mixed in with other BBC shows of the time. The show was mainly filmed in Warwick, Warwickshire, with some scenes being filmed in neighbouring Leamington Spa. The first two series have since been released on DVD. Dangerfield is regularly shown on UKTV Channels – Alibi & Drama The Title theme music, and incidental music, are by Nigel Hess. In Series 1, Episodes 1, 2 and 3 the piano music that Dangerfield hears when he thinks of his wife, or looks at her piano, is from the Adagio movement of the Piano Concerto No. 2 by Dimitri Shostakovich. == Cast == * Nigel Le Vaillant as Dr. Paul Dangerfield (Series 1–4) * Nigel Havers as Dr. Jonathan Paige (Guest Series 4; Series 5–6) * Nadim Sawalha as Dr. Shaaban Hamada (Series 1–5) * Bill Wallis as Dr. Nick McKenzie (Series 1–5) * Amanda Redman as Dr. Joanna Stevens (Series 1–2) * Hilary Lyon as Dr. Roz Parker (Series 2) * Fiona Victory as Dr. Annie Robbins (Series 3–4) * George Irving as DI Ken Jackson (Series 1–2) * Michael Melia as DI Frank Dagley (Series 3–4) * Jane Gurnett as DI Gillian Kramer (Series 5–6) * Tracy Gillman as DC Nicky Green (Series 1–2) * Nicola Cowper as DS Helen Diamond (Series 3–6) * Ian Gain as DC Gary Monk (Series 5–6) * Idris Elba as DC Matt Gregory (Series 6) * Roderick Smith as Sgt.
