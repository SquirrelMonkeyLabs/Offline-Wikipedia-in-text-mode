 "text": "Roasting is a way of cooking. Something gets roasted if it is put over a fire, and some is burnt. The same effect can also be attained with a grill at a barbecue. == Meat == In different countries people like to roast different things. People usually roast meats such as pork, beef, chicken, lamb, and duck. The roasted meat, along with its accompanying vegetables, is often called a roast. Most meat being roasted has to cook for a relatively long time, to ensure that it is cooked through. Variations to this include lamb and beef, which may be left \"pink\" or partially uncooked towards the centre. == Other == Other things can be roasted too. For example, vegetables, coffee and chocolate. Coffee and chocolate are always roasted. Category:Cooking methods",
