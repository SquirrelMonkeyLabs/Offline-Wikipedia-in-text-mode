 "text": "Bloomers also known as the bloomer, Turkish dress, American dress, or simply reform dress, are divided lower-body garments for women. They emerged in the 19th century as a healthier and more comfortable alternative to the heavy, restrictive dresses commonly worn by American women at the time. The name \"bloomers\" comes from Amelia Bloomer, a prominent women's rights activist who popularized this style. == References == *[Dann, Norman K. (2016). Ballots, Bloomers and Marmalade.
