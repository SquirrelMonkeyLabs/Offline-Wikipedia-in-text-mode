He was King James II in England and Ireland, and King James VII in Scotland. He was also Duke of Normandy from 31 December 1660. He lost his kingdoms in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He did not succeed in taking them back in a war, and he spent the rest of his life in France. He was the last Roman Catholic king in the British Isles. Some of his people did not like his religious ideas, leading a group of them to disobey and fight against him. This was called the Glorious Revolution in England and Scotland. King James and his son, James Francis Edward went into exile. The king was replaced by his Protestant daughter, Queen Mary II, and her husband King William III and II. They became rulers in 1689. The belief that James, not William III or Mary II, was the one true ruler became known as Jacobitism (from Jacobus or Iacobus, Latin for James). James made one serious attempt to recover his throne when he landed in Ireland in 1689. After his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in the summer of 1690, he returned to France, living the rest of his life under the protection of King Louis XIV. His son James Francis Edward Stuart (The Old Pretender) and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart (The Young Pretender and Bonnie Prince Charlie) attempted to restore the Jacobite line after James's death, but failed. == Issue == Name Birth Death Notes By Anne Hyde By Anne Hyde By Anne Hyde By Anne Hyde Charles, Duke of Cambridge 22 October 1660 5 May 1661 Mary II 30 April 1662 28 December 1694 married 1677, William III, Prince of Orange; no issue James, Duke of Cambridge 11 or 12 July 1663 20 June 1667 Anne 6 February 1665 1 August 1714 married 1683, Prince George of Denmark; no surviving issue Charles, Duke of Kendal 4 July 1666 22 May 1667 Edgar, Duke of Cambridge 14 September 1667 8 June 1671 Henrietta 13 January 1669 15 November 1669 Catherine 9 February 1671 5 December 1671 By Mary of Modena By Mary of Modena By Mary of Modena By Mary of Modena Unnamed child March or May 1674 March or May 1674 miscarriage Catherine Laura 10 January 1675 3 October 1675 died of convulsions.Weir, 260 Unnamed child October 1675 October 1675 stillborn Isabel (or Isabella) 28 August 1676 2 or 4 March 1681 buried in Westminster Abbey on 4 March (Old Style) as \"The Lady Isabella, daughter to the Duke of York\"J.
