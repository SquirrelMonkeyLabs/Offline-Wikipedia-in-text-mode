 "text": "Treat Myself is the third album by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor. Epic Records released it on January 31, 2020, after delaying it for over a year from its originally scheduled release date. Trainor worked with producers including Mike Sabath, Tyler Johnson, Ojivolta, and Andrew Wells. Initially inspired by pop artists and her experiences with panic disorder, Trainor rewrote the album to follow the changing trends in the music industry and the rising popularity of hip-hop. It features guest appearances by Sabath, Nicki Minaj, Lennon Stella, Sasha Sloan, the Pussycat Dolls, and AJ Mitchell. Treat Myself is a pop, funk, and R&B; album with hip-hop influences which explores themes such as female duality, body image, self-esteem issues, and relationships. Trainor promoted the album with public appearances and televised performances. Several tracks released in 2018 were scrapped from it after the delay. Treat Myself includes three singles: \"No Excuses\" (2018) and \"Nice to Meet Ya\" (2020), which respectively peaked at numbers 46 and 89 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and \"Wave\" (2019). Some reviewers thought the quality of Treat Myself was worth the long wait and that it showcased Trainor's artistic range, while others commented on its production choices and criticized its lyrical themes. In the US, the album debuted at number 25 on the Billboard 200. It peaked within the top 40 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, Spain, and Switzerland. ==Track listing== ==Charts== Weekly chart positions for Treat Myself Chart (2020) Peak position ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Epic Records albums Category:Meghan Trainor albums Category:Pop albums Category:Funk albums Category:R&B; albums",
