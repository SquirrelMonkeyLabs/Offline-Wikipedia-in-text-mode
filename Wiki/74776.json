 "text": "Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Franz August Karl Albert Emanuel; 26 August 1819 – 14 December 1861) was the consort of the British monarch from 1840 until his death in 1861 as the husband of Queen Victoria. == Biography == === Early Life === Albert was born as Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld on August 26, 1819, in Coburg, a small German principality in the German Confederation. He was the second son of Duke Franz Frederick Augustus of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha and Duchess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. His father was a liberal and reform-minded ruler, and his mother was known for her social conscience and charitable activities. === Education === Albert's early education took place at the court of Saxe-Coburg, where he was tutored privately. He later attended the University of Bonn, where he studied law, political science, and the arts. His education was shaped by his father's progressive views and his own interests in politics and social reform. === Childhood and family === Albert's upbringing was influenced by his parents' progressive ideals. His father emphasized a well-rounded education, and Albert was taught many subjects including science, philosophy, and the arts. Albert had a close relationship with his older brother, Ernest, and his younger siblings. The family was supportive of his education and ambitions. === Marriage === Albert and then-Princess Victoria were first cousins, sharing a common lineage through their German royal families. They had known each other since childhood, but their relationship developed into a romantic one in the 1830s. Albert proposed to Victoria in 1839. Despite some initial reluctance from Victoria's advisors due to his German nationality and lack of political experience, the marriage went forward as planned. They were married on February 10, 1840, at the Chapel Royal, St. James’s Palace in London. === Role as consort === As Prince consort, Albert was not given formal political power but took an active role in advising Victoria. He was involved in domestic and foreign policy discussions and had a significant influence on various matters of state. Albert was instrumental in organizing the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a landmark event showcasing British industrial and cultural achievements. He was also involved in reforming the monarchy’s public image, aiming to make it more approachable and engaged with the public. Albert promoted educational reforms and was a patron of the arts and sciences. His contributions led to the establishment of institutions like the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Albert Hall. === Illness and Death === Albert’s health began to decline in the late 1850s. He suffered from a series of illnesses, including what was diagnosed as typhoid fever, but his health problems were compounded by stress and overwork. Albert's condition worsened significantly in late 1861. He passed away on December 14, 1861, at the age of 42, at Windsor Castle. == Issue == Albert and Victoria had nine children, whose marriages connected many European royal families.
