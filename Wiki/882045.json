 "text": "The Swedish alphabet () consists of nearly the same letters as the English alphabet except for the three extra letters in the end being Å å, Ä ä, Ö ö. These letters can be found on words such as: * Ål (meaning eel) * Äpplen (meaning apples) * Öppna (meaning open) While the Swedish alphabet uses all of the letters of the English alphabet, the letters Q, W, and Z are only used in words borrowed from other languages (e.g. Qatar, websidda, zebra).
