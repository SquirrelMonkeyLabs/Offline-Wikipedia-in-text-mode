 "text": "Incapacity Benefit was a United Kingdom social security benefit that was paid to people who were sick for more than 28 weeks. It replaced Invalidity Benefit in 1995. The government began to stop Incapacity Benefit in 2008 by stopping new people claiming it. They moved people onto Employment and Support Allowance. To get it people had to pass the All Work Test, to show that there was no work they could do. ==References== Category:Social security in the United Kingdom",
