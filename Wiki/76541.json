 "text": "MiG Alley was a place during the Korean War that had a lot of North Korean MiG-15 Fagots in the area. It was over north west North Korea, near China. F-86 Sabres mainly fought the MiGs. Some of the pilots were Russian fighter pilots from World War II and were very well trained. They were called \"honchos\" (Japanese for \"big shot\"). The top kills were scored by Soviet aces, so it was said that the Soviets won. ==Related pages== *Mikoyan Category:Korean War Category:United States Air Force Category:Military aviation",
