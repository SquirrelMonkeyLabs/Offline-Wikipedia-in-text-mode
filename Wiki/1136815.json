 "text": "Quantum nonlocality is a concept of quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of particles. In general, it emphasizes the implications of changes in one particle affecting another particle instantly, even across large distances. Quantum entanglement is related to quantum nonlocality, but they are not strictly equivalent. == Related pages == * EPR paradox * Quantum mechanics * Quantum entanglement == Other websites == * Quantum Entanglement and Information - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy * Quantum nonlocality without entanglement: explicit dependence on prior probabilities of nonorthogonal mirror-symmetric states - npj Quantum Information * Understanding Quantum Mechanics #3: Non-locality - Sabine Hossenfelder, YouTube * What is the difference between nonlocality and entanglement? - Quantum Mechanics, Physics Stack Exchange Category:Quantum mechanics",
