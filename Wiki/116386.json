 "text": "Feliformia is a suborder in the mammal order Carnivora. It contains all the Felidae, which are cat-like female animals. The suborder also contains the relatives of the cats, which includes hyaenas, civets, Asiatic linsangs, and more. There are six families, twelve subfamilies, 56 genera and 114 species in the Feliformia suborder now. Molecular phylogeny shows the Feliformia is monophyletic.Eizirik E. et al 2010. Pattern and timing of the diversification of the mammalian order Carnivora inferred from multiple nuclear gene sequences. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 56: 49-63. The other suborder of Carnivora is the dog-like Caniformia. == Taxonomy == * Suborder Feliformia (\"cat-like\") ** Family Eupleridae: Fossa and others ** Family Felidae: Cats *** Subfamily Felinae *** Subfamily Pantherinae ** Family Nandiniidae: *** Genus Nandinia: African palm civet ** Family Viverridae: Civet cats, Genets etc. ** Family Hyaenidae: Hyaenas *** Subfamily Hyaeninae *** Subfamily Protelinae ** Family Herpestidae: Mongooses ** Family Primodontidae: Asiatic linsang ** Family Eupleridae: Varied group, endemic to Madagascar * †Barbourofelidae: Miocene \"false\" sabre-tooths \"true\" sabre- tooths are in the Felidae. * †Nimravidae: \"false\" sabre-tooths, from Eocene to end Miocene. * †Stenoplesictidae: Civet-like animals * †Percrocutidae: hyaena- like forms from the Miocene to later Pliocene === Cladogram === == References == :1.
