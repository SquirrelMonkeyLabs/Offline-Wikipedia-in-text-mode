 "text": "On 13 January 2012, the Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia hit the bottom of the sea floor and overturned after striking an underwater rock off Isola del Giglio, Tuscany, resulting in 32 deaths. The eight year old Costa Cruises vessel was on the first leg of a cruise around the Mediterranean Sea when she deviated from her planned route at the Isola del Giglio, sailed closer to the island, and struck a rock formation on the sea floor. A six-hour rescue effort brought most of the passengers ashore. Many blamed the ship's captain Francesco Schettino, who left the ship shortly after the sinking began leaving behind the crew and passengers. ==References== Category:2012 disasters Category:2012 in Europe Category:2010s in Italy Category:Transport disasters in Europe Category:Shipwrecks Category:January 2012 events",
