He was born in Lockport, New York. He met James Naismith, inventor of basketball, while Morgan was studying at Springfield College, Massachusetts in 1892. Like Naismith, Morgan went for a career in Physical Education at the YMCA. He was inspired by Naismith and basketball, in 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Morgan invented \"Mintonette\" a less hard team sport than a basketball which was more suitable for older members of the YMCA but one that still needed athletic skill. Morgan died in Lockport, New York from pneumonia on 27 December 1942, aged 72. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1942 deaths Category:American inventors Category:Educators from Massachusetts Category:Businesspeople from Massachusetts Category:Businesspeople from New York (state) Category:Sportspeople from New York (state) Category:Sportspeople from Massachusetts Category:People from Lockport, New York Category:People from Holyoke, Massachusetts Category:Educators from New York (state)",
