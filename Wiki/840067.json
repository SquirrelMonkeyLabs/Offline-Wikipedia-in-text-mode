 "text": "On April 20, 2021, Ma'khia Bryant, a 16-year-old African American girl, was fatally shot by a police officer. Bryant had been trying to stab another person in Columbus, Ohio. The officers tried to stop Bryant from doing so. Bryant was transported to a local hospital. She was pronounced dead half an hour later. The police were wearing body cameras, and the cameras recorded the shooting. On March 11, 2022, the grand jury decided not to charge the police officer with a crime. The court later said that the killing was justified, or legal. This was because the officer thought someone was at risk of death or serious injury. Under Ohio law, a police officer can use deadly force in this situation. ==References== Category:2021 in the United States Category:2021 deaths Category:April 2021 events Category:2004 births Category:People shot and killed by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Deaths by person in the United States",
