 "text": "Anomaloglossus parimae is a frog. Scientists found it in Venezuela. Scientists think it might also live in Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives in rainforests. It lives on the ground near streams. Scientists saw the frog in exactly one place, Serranía Parima. They saw it between 640 and 670 meters above sea level. Scientists saw this frog inside two protected places, Parima-Tapirapecó National Park and Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Anomaloglossus do: The female frog lays eggs on the ground and the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out. In the 1990s, people dug into the ground to look for gold even though this was against the law, but scientists do not know if they do this now. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
