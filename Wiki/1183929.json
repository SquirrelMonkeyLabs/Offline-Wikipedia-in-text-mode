 "text": "The United Progressive Alliance (UPA; Hindi: संयुक्त प्रगतशील गठबंधन) was a political alliance in India led by the Indian National Congress. It was formed after the 2004 general election with support from left-leaning political parties when no single party got the majority. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governed India for two terms from 2004 to 2014. After that, it lost power to its main political rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Before it was dissolved, the UPA had control over seven states and union territories in India. On 18 July 2023, the UPA was officially replaced by a new political coalition called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), which was formed in preparation for the 2024 general election. == Former Members == Current Members at the time of dissolution.
