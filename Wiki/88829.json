 "text": "Nu (uppercase/lowercase Ν ν) is a letter of the Greek alphabet used to represent the \"n\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 50. Letters that came from it include the Roman N and Cyrillic Н. In statistics, the lowercase u can be used to represent degrees of freedom. In physics, the same letter can also used to represent kinematic viscosity and the frequency of a wave. When typesetting mathematics, sometimes the roman lowercase v is used in conjunction with u, sometimes leading to problems with both letters being indistinguishable from each other in some fonts. == Related pages == * Mu (letter) == References == Category:Greek alphabet",
