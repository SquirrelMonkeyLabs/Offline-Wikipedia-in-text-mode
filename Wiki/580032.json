Friedman joined the law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman (then known as Kasowitz, Hoff, Benson & Torres) in 1994, where he met and represented Donald Trump, then chairman and president of The Trump Organization. He served as an advisor to Trump during his successful presidential campaign. In December 2016, President-elect Trump announced that he was nominee for ambassador to Israel. His nomination was met with support from conservative Israeli and Jewish American activist groups, and opposition from liberal advocacy organizations, particularly J Street. Friedman was confirmed by the full Senate on March 23 with a 52â€“46 vote and officially sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on March 29. In 1984, Friedman met President Ronald Reagan when Reagan visited Temple Hillel and became the first sitting president since George Washington to visit a synagogue. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Israel Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Jewish American politicians Category:Jewish businesspeople Category:Jewish lawyers Category:New York University alumni Category:Politicians from New York City Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
