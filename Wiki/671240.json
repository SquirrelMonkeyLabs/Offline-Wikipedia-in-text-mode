 "text": "Gate of China is one of the Gates of old China. In Chinese, people call it \"Zhōnghuámén\" (). \"Gate of China\" was built in Ming Dynasty and now settles in Qinghai District, Nanjing, China. It is 16512 square meter. \"Gate of China\" is very magnificent for its barbican. It's the firmest barbican in China. The barbican is a small space between gate and the barbican door. When the enemies go into it, the doors can block them so that the soldiers that have already hidden in the barbican can kill them easily. In the past, Taiping Kingdom of Heaven tried to attack into Nanjing, however, the gate wasn't ruined at all. Category:Buildings and structures in China",
