 "text": "The Dominion of Newfoundland was a British Dominion from 1907 to 1949. It was in northeastern North America along the Atlantic coast. It was made up of the island of Newfoundland and Labrador on the mainland. The territory was a British colony until 1907, when it was made a dominion. The Statute of Westminster of 11 December 1931 said that the Dominion of Newfoundland was independent within the British Commonwealth, along with Canada, Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. But on 16 February 1934 the Newfoundland parliament gave up its self-government,The Newfoundland Royal Commission, 1933 (The Amulree Commission) and governance of the dominion went back to being controlled from London. Though governed from overseas, Newfoundland stayed legally a dominion, until the British sold Newfoundland to Canada in 1949 to become Canada's tenth province. ==References== Category:Historical territories of Canada Category:Former countries in North America Category:1907 establishments in North America Category:1949 disestablishments Category:1900s establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1940s disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:20th-century disestablishments in North America",
