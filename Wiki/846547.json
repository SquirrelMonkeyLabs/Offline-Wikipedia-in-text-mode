 "text": "Thank U, Next (stylized in all lowercase) is the fifth studio album by American singer Ariana Grande. It was released on February 8, 2019, by Republic Records, less than six months after her album Sweetener (2018). The cover shows Grande upside down with a dark ponytail, with \"thank u, next\" spray-painted across her neck. Digital versions of the album show a pink background, while the physical album has a black background. Three singles were released from the album: \"Thank U, Next\", \"7 Rings\", and \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\". The first two entered at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, Canadian Hot 100, and in several other countries. \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" entered at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 when \"7 Rings\" was on top and \"Thank U, Next\" was at number three. This made Grande the first solo artist to occupy the top three of that chart in one week. In the UK, all three singles reached number one. The album entered charts at number one in several countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. ==Track listing== ===Notes=== * signifies a co-producer *All track titles are stylized in all lowercase, except \"NASA\" and \"Monopoly\", which are stylized in all caps. ===Samples=== *\"Fake Smile\" contains a sample of \"After Laughter (Comes Tears)\" by Wendy Rene, written by Joseph W.
