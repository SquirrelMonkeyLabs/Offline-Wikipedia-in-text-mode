It was first planned that the motorway would go to Sheffield through the Pennines, but this has not happened yet. The M67 is long. ==Junctions== M67 motorway junctions Westbound exits (B carriageway) Junction Eastbound exits (A carriageway) Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Manchester M60 City Centre A57 J1 Terminus Start of motorway No access (on-ramp only) J1a Denton A6017 Denton A57 J2 No access (on-ramp only) Hyde A57 J3 Hyde A57 Start of motorway Terminus M1, Sheffield, Barnsley, Mottram, Glossop A57 (A628) (A616) Hyde, Stockport A560 ==References== Category:Motorways in England",
