 "text": "Andrew Klavan (born July 13, 1954) is an American writer, novelist and journalist. Klavan was born Jewish but converted to Christianity. By his own description, Klavan started out as a liberal Democrat but after the Cold War ended he thought that Ronald Reagan was the reason that it ended. And because of that Klavan became a Republican. In an interview with Dave Rubin, Klavan said that the reason that he was a conservative was that he supported classical liberalism. Klavan has complained about Hollywood movies being too left-wing though he has praised some movies like The Dark Knight and Toy Story 3 for being right-wing. Klavan was critical of the media saying that it refused to ask necessary questions about the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. Klavan also said that Barack Obama didnâ€™t understand economics. Klavan was also critical of conservatives who opposed the election of Donald Trump. Klavan also writes for the website The Daily Wire run by Ben Shapiro. Klavan also filmed a video for Prager University about fake news. == Other websites == * * * Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American Christians Category:American novelists Category:Jewish American writers Category:Jews who converted to Christianity Category:Screenwriters from New York City Category:Writers from New York City Category:American bloggers",
