 "text": "The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), known \"officially\" as the United States Department Of Government Efficiency Service Temporary Organization, is a temporary commission of the United States federal government. It is a rebranding of the United States Digital Service, and was announced by Donald Trump, in the early days of his second term as U.S. president. It is led by Elon Musk, and has sparked considerable controversy. In April 2025, Trump said to his advisors or \"inner circle that Musk will leave soon\", according to a media outlet.https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/02/trump-musk-leaving- political-liability-00265784. Retrieved 2025-04-02 Musk said that he believes that the commission could lower the U.S. federal budget by $2 trillion. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has supported the idea. He also added a rumor that the department would like to terminate federal student aid for the coming 4 academic years. Despite the name, DOGE is not a federal executive department, which are created through an act of Congress. The U.S. DOGE Service, is housed within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Trump said that the commission's work will end no later than July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.. ==Actions and powers== Musk has been involved in several controversial actions since DOGE was created. Musk, with President Donald Trump, began a comprehensive initiative to restructure the federal government. This includes downsizing federal agencies such as USAID and the US Department of Education. Musk claims he is eliminating perceived inefficiencies, cancelling significant grants, and reducing the workforce to cut costs. DOGE has gained access to critical government systems, including the Treasury Department's payment infrastructure. This access allows DOGE to monitor and potentially halt federal payments, including those to contractors and social services. Musk's actions have faced legal opposition. A U.S. judge issued a temporary order blocking steps to dismantle USAID, citing constitutional concerns. Additionally, lawsuits have been filed against DOGE, alleging violations of federal laws and regulations. People have protested DOGE and Elon Musk's involvement in it. DOGE has experienced internal staffing changes, including the resignation of a staffer over racist online posts. Musk has indicated plans to rehire the individual, after Vice President J. D. Vance advocated for it. He believed online posts were not a good reason for someone to lose their job. ==Other information== Despite the similarity in name, and jokes mocking the department's name there is no definitive proof that DOGE was named after the famous internet memes or corresponding cryptocurrency of the same name. Some DOGE team members, including Elon Musk, are designated as \"special government employees\"; Those are in an advisory role that should last no longer than 130-days.https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/0V71Mo/kilder-til- politico-trump-sier-musk-snart-gir-seg-som-raadgiver.
