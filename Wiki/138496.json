The changes show the change of economical needs in that city. == History of the building == The building was founded as a brass factory. In the 18th century, it was one of many brass factories in the city. At the end of the 18th century, the brass industry in Stolberg lost importance. The building was sold to a clothier of the nearby village of Imgenbroich. He produced cloth for more than 60 years. At the beginning of the 19th century, the building was used as a restaurant. Some parts of the building were greatly in need of repair. At the end of the 20th century, major repairs were done to the building. Currently, it is used as an apartment building. ==Related pages== *Factory Bauschenberg == Other websites == * Historians are fascinated by the cloth mill Offermann Category:Buildings and structures in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Companies of Germany Category:18th-century establishments in Germany",
