 "text": "Drag queen is a gay slang term. It refers to a person who dresses up and portrays a woman for entertainment purposes. Although men dressed as women are the most common type of drag queen, trans women, female impersonators, and many other people can also be considered a drag queen. Drag queens exaggerate certain characteristics (such as make-up and eyelashes) for comic, dramatic, or satirical effect. Drag queens perform in gay bars. They participate in gay pride parades and drag pageants. They may make appearances at events such as gay rodeos. They generally do not want to pass as women. RuPaul is a drag queen well known through his many television appearances in the 1990s. He is the host of one of, if not the most, famous television show about drag, RuPaul's Drag Race. Movies about drag queens include The Birdcage and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. ==Related pages== *Drag king *Queen Harish Category:Gay slang Category:Performing arts Category:Entertainment occupations",
