He was the acting United States Secretary of Defense in the Trump administration from January 1, 2019 to June 24, 2019. On December 27, 2018, President Trump promoted him to Acting Secretary of Defense starting on January 1, 2019, replacing James Mattis. The White House announced on May 9, 2019, that Trump intended to nominate Shanahan as the Secretary of Defense. That decision was reversed on June 18, 2019, when Shanahan said that he was withdrawing, and Trump announced that he would be making Mark Esper the acting U.S. Secretary of Defense. Shanahan's last day in that position was June 24, 2019. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:United States Secretaries of Defense Category:Businesspeople from California Category:Politicians from California Category:People from Palo Alto, California",
