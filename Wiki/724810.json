 "text": "In the UK, a public health observatory (PHO) is a public health and wellness project. On 1 April 2013, the regional Public Health Observatories (PHOs) transferred along with the specialist observatories and the National Cancer Intelligence Network into Public Health England (PHE). PHO uses the word observatory, from astronomy, to show objectivity in measuring well-being. Public health, environmental health, diet, recreation, outdoor education, exercise and other concerns are explored by most public health observatories. The London Health Observatory pioneered methods in measuring social capital and how this affects healing and health in general. There was a network of public health observatories, one in each of the nine regions in England. There are health observatories in Wales , Scotland and Ireland. The Association of Public Health Observatories (APHO) represented the network of public health observatories across the UK and Ireland. It became part of Public Health England, along with all the English observatories except Lincolnshire on 1 April 2013. The Lincolnshire observatory continues with the support of the County Council. == References == == Other websites == *Association of Public Health Observatories *West Midlands Public Health Observatory *East Midlands Public Health Observatory *London Health Observatory *North East Public Health Observatory *South West Public Health Observatory *South East Public Health Observatory *National Obesity Observatory *ChiMat *Injury Observatory for Britain and Ireland *Mental Health Observatory *Lincolnshire Research Observatory Category:Medical and health organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Observatories Category:Organisations based in England Category:Health in the United Kingdom",
