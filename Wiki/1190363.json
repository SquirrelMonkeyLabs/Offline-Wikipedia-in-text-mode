 "text": "OMC or Otara Millionaires Club, were a New Zealand music group, then duo, with vocalist Pauly Fuemana later becoming the sole member. OMC was best known for the 1996 hit \"How Bizarre\", named one of the greatest New Zealander songs of all time by the Australasian Performing Right Association. The full name of the band is a tongue-in-cheek reference to ÅŒtara's status as one of the poorest suburbs of Auckland. ==Related pages== *Tina Romero *Umberto Tozzi *Paola & Chiara *Corey Hart Category:New Zealand",
