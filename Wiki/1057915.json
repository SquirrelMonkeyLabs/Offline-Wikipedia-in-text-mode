 "text": "Hurricane Otis was a small but very intense and damaging October 2023 tropical cyclone. The storm killed more than 50 people in Southwestern Mexico. It struck early on October 25. Winds of Otis were when the storm struck. It underwent rapid intensification that was not even forecast to happen with the storm. It made landfall near Acapulco. It was the most intense eastern Pacific hurricane to ever strike anywhere in this region. Early damage reports showed Otis might have caused $15 billion overall in Mexico. Other damage reports indicate more than that. ==References== Category:Hurricanes in Mexico Category:2023 in weather Category:East Pacific hurricanes Category:Natural disasters Category:October 2023 events",
