 "text": "Dreamlinux was a Linux distribution, a collection of computer programs that is designed for the use of the Linux operating system on a computer. The Dreamlinux distribution was made in Brazil, and is based on Debian, another commonly-used Linux distribution. Dreamlinux can be used in Portuguese. ==Methods of booting== There are several ways to use Dreamlinux to run the Linux operating system on a computer. * Using a compact disc called a live CD, the computer user can start up (or boot) the operating system straight from the disc without installing anything on the computer. * The user can boot Dreamlinux in the same way from an external flash drive containing the programs, connected to the computer through a USB port. * The user can install the programs in Dreamlinux on a computer's internal hard drive and run them from there. ==Graphical User Interface== Most operating systems have a graphical user interface, or GUI, which allows the user to interact with the programs using a graphical display. The GUI which Dreamlinux uses looks similar to the one used by Apple's Mac OS X operating system, with a toolbar in the center. The user can also download the \"Engage\" theme, which gives the toolbar some animated aspects. ==Related pages== *List of Linux distributions * Xfce == Other websites == * Official Dreamlinux site * Official English forum Category:Debian-based Linux distributions",
