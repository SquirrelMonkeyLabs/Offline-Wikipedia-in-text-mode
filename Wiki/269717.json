 "text": "Phosphide is an ion made of phosphorus. This can be the ion, where one phosphorus atom has three extra electrons, or one of several polyphosphides where multiple phosphorus atoms are part of a larger polyatomic ion. Phosphide is a reducing agent. Phosphides (chemical compounds having the phosphide ion in them) react with acids to make phosphine gas. Sodium phosphide is an example. Some phosphides are semiconductors and are not ionic with P3- ions. They are less reactive. Some metals form alloys with phosphorus to make phosphides. == Chemistry == In , phosphorus is in the -3 oxidation state. The oxidation states of polyphosphides are more complicated.
