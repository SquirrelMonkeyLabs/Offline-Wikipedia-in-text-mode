She has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Fareham since 2015. \\- \\- She is a member of the Conservative Party. In July 2022, Braverman announced her candidacy for Leader of the Conservative Party in the leadership election to replace Boris Johnson. She was eliminated in the second round of voting on 14 July 2022. Braverman resigned as Home Secretary on 19 October 2022. She said this was because she had made an \"honest mistake\" by sharing an official document from her personal email address with a colleague in Parliament. In her resignation letter she criticized the leadership of Truss. When Rishi Sunak replaced Truss as prime minister, he picked Braverman as Home Secretary again. ==References== ==Notes== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs Category:Politicians from London Category:UK MPs 2015–2017 Category:UK MPs 2017–2019 Category:UK MPs 2019–2024 Category:English King's Counsel Category:Secretaries of State for the Home Department Category:UK MPs 2024–present",
