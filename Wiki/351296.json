 "text": "Anne of Bohemia (11 May 1365 – 7 June 1394) was the queen of Richard II of England. She was the oldest daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Elizabeth of Pomerania.Strickland, Agnes, Lives of the Queens of England from the Norman Conquest, (Lea & Strickland, 1841), 303, 308. Many people did not like the marriage. It did not bring money and very little other benefits. Richard gave 20,000 florins (around £4,000,000 in today's value) in payment to her brother Wenceslas. The only benefit, which was said to be small, was that England could trade freely in both Bohemian lands, and lands of the Holy Roman Empire. Anne and King Richard II were married in Westminster Abbey on 22 January 1382. The wedding was the fifth royal wedding in Westminster Abbey. It was not followed by any other royal wedding in Westminster Abbey for another 537 years.\"HRH Prince William of Wales and Miss Catherine Middleton to Wed at Abbey \". They were married for 12 years, but had no children. Anne's death from plague in 1394 at Sheen Manor was hard for Richard. His later unwise conduct lost him the throne.Strickland, 323–324. Richard married his second wife, Isabella of Valois, on 31 October 1396. Anne of Bohemia is known to have made the sidesaddle more popular to ladies of the Middle Ages. ==References== Category:People buried in Westminster Abbey Category:Kings and Queens consort of England Category:1366 births Category:1394 deaths Category:Bohemia",
