 "text": "Lahn-Dill is a Kreis (district) in the west of Hesse, Germany. == History == In 1977 the district Gießen was merged with the districts Wetzlar and Dillkreis to the new Lahn-Dill-Kreis. However this big district was not popular, so in 1979 Giessen was split from it. == Geography == The main rivers of the district are the Lahn and the Dill, which also gave it the name. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms shows the imperial eagle in the top, a sign for the imperial city Wetzlar. The bottom part - taken from the arms of the previous Dillkreis - shows the lion of Nassau and the horn of the princes of Orange-Nassau, which later became the Dutch royal family. Dillenburg was the capital of the county of Nassau and later of Nassau-Orange. == Towns and municipalities == Towns Municipalities # Aßlar # Braunfels # Dillenburg # Haiger # Herborn # Leun # Solms # Wetzlar # Bischoffen # Breitscheid # Dietzhölztal # Driedorf # Ehringshausen # Eschenburg # Greifenstein # Hohenahr 9.
