 "text": "Bulgarian (, [ˈbɤ̞lɡarski ɛˈzik]) is an Indo-European language. It is spoken mainly in Bulgaria and parts of North Macedonia, Serbia, Ukraine and Moldova. The Bulgarian language is similar to the Macedonian and the Serbian languages, which are part of the South Slavic branch of Slavic languages. There are nearly 9 million people in 2011 who use Bulgarian as their main language. Bulgarian is a part of the so-called Balkan \"Sprachbund\" or linguistic group, which also includes Greek, Macedonian, Romanian, Albanian, and the Torlakian dialect of the Serbian language. This does not mean the languages are necessarily related, but that they share certain loanwords and grammatical characteristics due to frequent contact over the years. == Alphabet == А а Б б В в Г г Д д Е е Ж ж З з И и Й й К к Л л М м Н н О о П п Р р С с Т т У у Ф ф Х х Ц ц Ч ч Ш ш Щ щ Ъ ъ Ь ь Ю ю Я я ==Related pages== * Romanization of Bulgarian ==References== Category:South Slavic languages Category:Bulgarian culture Category:Languages of Greece Category:Kosovo Category:Languages of Moldova Category:Languages of Romania Category:Languages of Serbia Category:Languages of North Macedonia Category:Languages of Turkey Category:Languages of Ukraine",
