 "text": "Joseph Crowley (; born March 16, 1962) is an American politician. He was the U.S. Representative for New York's 14th congressional district from 2013 to 2019. He was Chair of the House Democratic Caucus from 2017 to 2019. He also was Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party from 2006 to 2019. On June 26, 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary for his seat. Crowleyâ€™s unseen defeat is thought to be one of the biggest upsets in congressional history. Until his defeat in June 2018, Crowley was seen by many as the replacement of Nancy Pelosi in the Democratic House leadership. ==Election history== ==References== ==Other websites== * Congressman Joseph Crowley official U.S. House site * Crowley for Congress * * * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:United States representatives from New York (state) Category:Politicians from New York City Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:21st-century American politicians Category:20th- century American politicians",
