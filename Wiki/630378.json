 "text": "Crkvenica is a Bosnian river. It is a right bank tributary of the Vrbanja River. Crkvenica rises between the northwestern slopes of Očauš and Šipraška brda mountains. It flows southeast at around above sea level. The river drains the central part of the northern slopes of the Dinaric mountain massif. Its mouth is in Šiprage (Kotor Varoš). It is long. The river is known for its water mills; during the 1950s, there were about 18 of them.Vojnogeografski institut, Ed. (1955): Travnik (List karte 1:100.000, Izohipse na 20 m).

Tufa stećci on the Crkvenica riverbank is a relic of the Bogomil settlement in the twelfth century. The stećci was originally located at the confluence of the Crkvenica and the Vrbanja.Radimsky V.

The stones were quarried and built into the walls of the surrounding buildings, possibly due to belief in their miraculous properties. One of the most well-preserved tombstones is in its original location, submerged in the River Vrbanja. ==References== ==Related pages== * Vrbanja river * Očauš * Šiprage Category:Rivers of Bosnia and Herzegovina",
