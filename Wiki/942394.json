 "text": "The Elections in the Argentine Republic are held every two years to elect the legislative bodies (which are renewed by halves, in 4-year terms) and, since 1995, every four to elect the executive power (before they were held every six years). The national constitution, in its first article, establishes that the country has a \"representative, republican and federal\" government system. Due to its condition as a federal country, two main types of elections are regularly held in Argentina: * National elections, to elect the federal authorities of the country: the Executive Power, made up of the President and the Vice President, and the National Congress, made up of Senators and Deputies. * Provincial and City of Buenos Aires or local elections, to elect the authorities of each province: the executive powers of the provinces and their legislatures. In all cases, voting is universal, secret and compulsory for citizens over 16 years of age; although for those under 18 and over 70 years of age, no sanction is foreseen in the event of No vote. In some cases, the vote of settled foreigners is allowed. In November 2012, a law was passed that allows young people between 16 and 18 years of age to vote optionally. Argentine citizens living abroad may vote in embassies and consulates of Argentina. ==References== ==Other websites== *National Electoral Code (in Spanish) *Election Atlas of Argentina from 1983 *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Argentina Elections 2007 *Argentina Elections 101 Category:Politics of Argentina",
