 "text": "Cultural appropriation is when one culture wrongly adopts and takes elements from another culture. One culture does not understand or respect the other culture. Cultures often do not acknowledge that they are taking something from another culture. Often a majority culture uses cultural elements of a minority culture. Appropriation can be disrespectful or have stereotypes. Cultural appropriation can include groups making money off of minority cultures. Oversimplifying minority cultures is also an example. Cultural appropriation is different than appreciation. Appreciation is when one values and respects the customs and cultures one is using or adopting. There are many examples in culture and every day life. People can dress up like other cultures during Halloween without having respect for the culture. There is often appropriation in pop culture. Singers or celebrities may use cultural dances or clothing and make a lot of money from it. ==Related pages== *Wigger ==References== appropriation Category:Controversies",
