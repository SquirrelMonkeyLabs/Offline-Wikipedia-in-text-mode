They both start within 2 miles of each other, and they start within a few miles northwest of Lehigh. The North Cottonwood starts near the west line of Marion County. It crosses into McPherson County and is parallel to the county line northward for 5 miles. Then, crosses back into Marion County. It goes through Durham, then into the Marion Reservoir. The South Cottonwood also starts near the west line of Marion County. It goes southward about 1 mile west of Lehigh. Then it flows eastward about 2 miles south of Hillsboro, then northeast towards the lower side of the Marion Reservoir. The North and South Cottonwood join about 1 mile southeast of the Marion Reservoir to become the North Fork Cottonwood River. Then, it goes through the city of Marion. The river goes southeast to Florence, then eastward towards Chase County.Chase County Map; KDOT. In Chase County, it goes northeast through Cedar Point then near Clements and Elmdale. It then flows eastward through Strong City, Cottonwood Falls. The South Fork Cottonwood River starts south of Matfield Green, then flows northward along the east side of Matfield Green and Bazaar. It combines with the North Fork Cottonwood River about 3 miles east of Cottonwood Falls. Then, it goes eastward near Saffordville and across into Lyon County near Plymouth, Kansas, then along the south edge of Emporia. It goes into the Neosho River about 5 miles east of Emporia. ==History== In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri.
