 "text": "Puerto Ricans in the United States, also called Stateside Puerto Ricans, or Puerto Rican Americans, are Puerto Ricans in the United States proper (the 50 states and the District of Columbia), who trace their heritage to or are born in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. The island of Puerto Rico is currently a territory of the United States although it has not been incorporated as an official state therefore it is controlled by the United States but has not been given state status. The history of Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States goes back to the incorporation of Puerto Rico as a territory of the United States back in 1897 following the capture of the island by the United States Army. Since then, many Puerto Ricans have moved to the mainland United States and settled there with some families living in the country for five generations now. During World War I, Puerto Ricans made up a significant portion of the United States Army and were credited for their bravery and contributions during the war. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in the United States",
