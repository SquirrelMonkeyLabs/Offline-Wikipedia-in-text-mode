 "text": "The McPlant is a sandwich from McDonald's fast food chain. Its main difference from a common hamburger is that it doesn't meat. Instead, it has a patty made from plants. It was created in collaboration with Beyond Meat, a company that makes plant-based meat. The patty is made from things like peas, rice and potatoes instead of beef or chicken. The main ingredients are onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise and cheese. The McPlant is an option for people who avoid eating meat or vegans. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Sandwiches Category:McDonald's foods",
