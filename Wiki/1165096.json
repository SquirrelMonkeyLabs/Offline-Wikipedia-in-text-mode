 "text": "The March 23 Movement, often abbreviated as M23 and also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army (Armée révolutionnaire du Congo), is a Congolese Tutsi-led, Rwandan-backed rebel military group. It is based in eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It operates mainly in the province of North Kivu, which borders both Uganda and Rwanda. On 20 November 2012, M23 took control of Goma, a provincial capital with a population of a million people. In late 2012, Congolese troops, along with UN troops, retook control of Goma, and M23 announced a ceasefire and said that it wanted to resume peace talks. ==References== Category:2012 establishments in Africa Category:Rebel militia groups in Africa Category:Organizations based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo",
