 "text": "Hawkman is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville. The original Hawkman first appeared in Flash Comics #1, published by All-American Publications in 1940. There has been many versions of Hawkman in DC Comics, all of them use archaic weaponry and have large wings, attached to a harness made from the special metal that allows them to fly. Most versions of Hawkman work closely with a partner/romantic interest named Hawkgirl or Hawkwoman. == Versions == Hawkman is most often depicted as human archaeologist Carter Hall—the modern-day reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian prince named Khufu—or as Thanagarian police officer Katar Hol from the planet Thanagar. The character is generally regarded as having one of the most confusing backstories of any in DC Comics, due to a series of reinventions over the years following DC's 1985 series Crisis on Infinite Earths. == In other media == The character has been adapted into other media numerous times, with significant appearances in the animated Justice League Unlimited cartoon, which featured Hawkgirl as a main character, as well as several DC Universe Original Animated Movies. In live action, the character first appeared onscreen in the two-part 1979 TV special Legends of the Superheroes by Bill Nuckols appearing alongside Adam West and Burt Ward as allies Batman and Robin. Hawkman was later portrayed by Michael Shanks in Smallville and by Falk Hentschel in The CW's Arrowverse family of shows, with both versions favoring the ancient Egyptian version of the character. Hawkman made his cinematic debut portrayed by Aldis Hodge in 2022's Black Adam set in the DC Extended Universe. ==Other websites== * History of Hawkman on Sequart Category:DC Comics superheroes",
