 "text": "Elimination Chamber (2010) (also known as No Way Out (2010) in Germany) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on February 21, 2010 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the first Elimination Chamber event made by WWE and replaced No Way Out as WWE's February pay-per-view. The idea of the show was that the two main event matches, one for the World Heavyweight Championship and one for the WWE Championship, would be in an Elimination Chamber. Each match had six wrestler in it: the defending champion and five challengers. Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against Triple H, Ted DiBiase, Randy Orton, John Cena, and Kofi Kingston in the Raw Elimination Chamber. Cena won the match and the title, but WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon directly made him defend it against Batista. Cena lost the match and the title in the end. In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Jericho, John Morrison, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk and R-Truth. On the undercard, Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kane, The Miz defended the WWE United States Championship against MVP, and Maryse and Gail Kim wrestled against LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in a tag team match. ==Matches== ===Elimination Chamber entrances and eliminations (Raw)=== Eliminated Wrestler Entered Eliminated by Method of elimination Times Randy Orton Ted DiBiase Pinned after being hit with a pipe by DiBiase 23:56 Ted DiBiase Kofi Kingston Pinned after a Trouble in Paradise 25:24 Kofi Kingston Sheamus Pinned after a Celtic Cross 26:02 Sheamus Triple H Pinned after a Low Blow and a Pedigree 28:38 Triple H John Cena Submitted to the STF 30:30 John Cena ===Elimination Chamber entrances and eliminations (SmackDown)=== Eliminated Wrestler Entered Eliminated by Method of elimination Times R-Truth CM Punk Pinned after a Go To Sleep 03:34 CM Punk Rey Mysterio Pinned after a Springboard Dive 09:58 Rey Mysterio John Morrison Pinned after a Starship Pain 20:00 John Morrison The Undertaker Pinned after a Chokeslam on the steel floor 28:24 Undertaker Chris Jericho Pinned after a Sweet Chin Music from Shawn Michaels 35:40 Chris Jericho ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Elimination Chamber website Category:2010 in American television Category:2010 in professional wrestling Category:Elimination Chamber Category:2010s in St. Louis, Missouri Category:February 2010 events Category:2010 in Missouri",
