 "text": "Rotherhithe () is a residential district in south east London. It is part of the London Borough of Southwark. Historically, the area was the most northeastern settlement in the county of Surrey. It is located on a peninsula on the South Bank of the River Thames and is a part of the Docklands area. It borders Bermondsey to the west and Deptford to the south east and faces Wapping and the Isle of Dogs on the north bank of the river. The Rotherhithe Tunnel is a road tunnel under the River Thames. It connects Limehouse in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets north of the river to Rotherhithe south of the river. A road runs through it called the A101. It was opened in 1908. It is a rare example of a road tunnel where road traffic, pedestrians and cyclists all share the same tunnel. Transport for London took over ownership and maintenance of the tunnel in 2001.
