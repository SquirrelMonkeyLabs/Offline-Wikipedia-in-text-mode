 "text": "Abell 2029 or A2029 is a large cluster of galaxies 1 billion light years away in the constellation Virgo.Chandra X-ray Observatory, \"Galaxy clusters and dark energy: Chandrao opens new line of investigation on dark energy\", Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Its central galaxy, IC 1101, is the largest galaxy known. Estimates ranging from 5.6 to over 6 million light years across. Contrast this with the Milky Way, which is 200,000 light years across. A2029 is also about 81 times bigger than the Milky Way, with a luminosity of 2 Lâ˜‰. This type of galaxy may have grown to its large size by accreting nearby galaxies. == References == ==Other websites== * *The Scale of the Universe (Astronomy Picture of the Day 2012 March 12) * Curious About Astronomy?, \"What is the largest galaxy?\", Cornell University Category:Galaxy clusters",
