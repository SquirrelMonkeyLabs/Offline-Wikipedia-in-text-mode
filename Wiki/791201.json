 "text": "The leaf green tree frog (Ranoidea phyllochroa) is a frog from Victoria and New South Wales in Australia. This frog lives in forests and grasslands, but it can also live in suburbs and cities. This frog lives near streams. The female lays eggs on plants underneath the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs in 12 weeks. Even though it is called the \"leaf green\" tree frog, it is usually olive green in color. It has a yellow stripe down each side of its body. This frog can change color, becoming very dark, to blend in with the area around it to hide. Scientists used to think the narrow fringed frog was the same species as the leaf green tree frog but they now think they are two species. They think so because the narrow fringed frog and leaf green tree frog have different voice calls and live in different places. The narrow fringed frog is also called the leaf green tree frog or leaf green river tree frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Australia",
