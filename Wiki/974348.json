The French team won ahead of the Netherlands and Belgium. ==Swimmers selection== Ahead of the relay, France held qualification races to select the team. ==Results== The race was held on a sunny day, but with the water temperature of the sea being low. At the beginning of the race Truus Klapwijk (backstroke) was leading the race. The second swimmer of the Netherlands Loes Brandt (breaststroke) was not as fast as the French swimmer and so the France was leading the race. With a lot of effort the later Dutch women Annie Treffers (sidestroke) and Rie Beisenherz (freestyle) were not able to close the gap. The French team won in a time of 2:56, 3 seconds ahead of the Netherlands. Belgium finished third and Sweden and Great Britain finished fourth and fifth.
