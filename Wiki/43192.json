In 2020, there were 123,851 people living there. The city is part of the Detroit Metropolitan Combined Statistial Area. Ann Arbor was started in 1824. It is thought that the city is named after the wife, Ann, of one of the founders. The University of Michigan was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. (Before that, the university had been in Detroit.) The city grew during the 1800s and 1900s. The only time the city did not grow was the Depression of 1873. During the 1960s and 1970s, Ann Arbor was an important place for the Civil Rights Movement, the anti-Vietnam War movement, and for left-wing and liberal politics. Today, Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan. The university is very important to the city because 30,000 people work for it. 12,000 of these workers work for the University of Michigan Health System, which are hospitals and clinics run by the university. Ann Arbor's economy is also very high-tech. High-tech companies come to the area because there are many graduates and a lot of research and development money at the university. == Sources == Category:County seats in Michigan Category:1824 establishments in the United States Category:1820s establishments in Michigan Territory",
