 "text": "Sodium phosphate is a group of chemical compounds made from sodium and phosphoric acid. As a triprotic acid, phosphoric acid has three hydrogen atoms that can be replaced by sodium in a chemical reaction. Depending on how many atoms are replaced, one of three compounds is made. ==Sodium dihydrogen phosphate== Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, also known as monosodium phosphate, is a chemical compound with the formula NaH2PO4. It is acidic. It is used in some baking powders. It is used as a laxative or a pH buffer (something that keeps a chemical from getting more acidic or basic). It is made by reaction of a little sodium hydroxide with phosphoric acid. ==Disodium hydrogen phosphate== Disodium hydrogen phosphate, also known as disodium phosphate is a chemical compound with the formula Na2HPO4. It is about neutral (not acidic or basic). It is used to prevent clumping in foods. It is made by reaction of some sodium hydroxide with phosphorus. ==Trisodium phosphate== Trisodium phosphate, also known as sodium phosphate, is a chemical compound with the formula Na3PO4. It is basic. It formerly was used in detergents, but the phosphate fueled algal blooms. It is made by combining sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid. ==Related pages== *Phosphite *Sodium phosphite *Hypophosphite Category:Phosphates Category:Sodium compounds",
