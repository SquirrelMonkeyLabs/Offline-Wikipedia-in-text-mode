 "text": "The Large intestine is also called the colon or large bowel. It connects the small intestine to the rectum and anus. It is about 1.5 meters long or 5 feet. It is shorter than the small intestine, but its diameter is larger. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as faeces before being removed by defecation. ==References== Category:Anatomy of the digestive system",
