 "text": "This is a list of tornadoes rated F5 on the Fujita scale, EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, IF5 on the , or T10-T11 on the TORRO scale, which is equivalent to an F5 rating. These ratings (F5/EF5/IF5/T10/T11) are the highest possible ratings on the various global tornado intensity scales. These various scales attempt to estimate the strength of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to nature and man-made structures in the tornado's path. Tornadoes are among the most violent known meteorological phenomena. Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the majority occurring in North America and Europe. In order to assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita created a way to estimate highest wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale. The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F5 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between 261-318 mph (420–512 kilometers per hour). . Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999, engineers questioned the reliability of the Fujita scale. Ultimately, a new scale was created that considered 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale.Multiple sources: * * The Enhanced Fujita scale is used almost entirely in North America. Most of Europe, however, uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (TORRO scale or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F5/EF5 tornadoes are about the same to T10 to T11 on the T-Scale. In the United States, between 1950 and January 31, 2007, a total of 50 tornadoes were officially rated F5, and since February 1, 2007, a total of nine tornadoes have been officially rated EF5. Since 1950, Canada has had one tornado officially rated an F5. Outside the United States and Canada, seven tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5/T10+ or equivalent: two each in France, Germany, and one in Italy, Argentina and Australia. Several other tornadoes have also been documented as possibly attaining this status, though they are not officially rated as such. The work of tornado expert revealed the existence of several dozen likely F5 tornadoes between 1880 and 1995. Grazulis also called into question the ratings of several tornadoes currently rated F5 by official sources. Many tornadoes officially rated F4/EF4 have been questioned and described as actual F5/EF5/T10+ tornadoes, and vice versa; since structures are completely destroyed in both cases, distinguishing between an EF4 tornado and an EF5 tornado is often very difficult.Multiple sources: * * Additionally, because tornado ratings are damage-based, many tornadoes capable of causing F5/EF5/T10+ damage, such as those that move through rural areas, may receive lower ratings because their strongest winds do not strike any suitable damage indicators.Multiple sources: * * ==List of events== The tornadoes on this list have been formally rated F5 by an official government source. Unless otherwise noted, the source of the F5 rating is the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS), as shown in the archives of the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Before 1950, assessments of F5 tornadoes are based primarily on the work of Thomas P. Grazulis. The NCDC has accepted 38 of his F5 classifications of tornadoes occurring between 1880 and 1950. In addition to the accepted ones, Grazulis rated a further 25 during the same period which were not accepted. Grazulis' work has identified 16 additional F5 tornadoes between 1950 and 1995, with four later being accepted by the NCDC. From 1950 to 1970, tornadoes were assessed retrospectively, primarily using information recorded in government databases, as well as newspaper photographs and eyewitness accounts. Beginning in 1971, tornadoes were rated by the NWS using on-site damage surveys. As of February 1, 2007, tornadoes in the United States are rated using the Enhanced Fujita scale, which replaced the Fujita scale in order to more accurately correlate tornadic intensity with damage indicators and to augment and refine damage descriptors. No earlier tornadoes will be reclassified on the Enhanced Fujita scale, and no new tornadoes in the United States will be rated on the original Fujita scale. France and Canada also adopted the EF-Scale in the next few years. Since the creation of the International Fujita scale in 2018, no tornadoes have been rated IF5. ===Official F5/EF5 tornadoes=== Worldwide, a total of 67 tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5: 59 in the United States, two each in France and Germany, and one each in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Italy. Of the 59 tornadoes in the United States, 50 are officially rated F5 on the original Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 11, 1953, and May 3, 1999), and nine are officially rated EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 4, 2007, and May 20, 2013). In total, 57 of these tornadoes have been rated F5 and ten have been rated EF5. #1764 Woldegk tornado #1800 Hainichen tornado #1845 Montville tornado #1876 Bowen tornado #1925 Tri-State Tornado #1930 Treviso–Udine tornado #1953 Waco tornado #1953 Fort Rice tornado #1953 Flint–Beecher tornado #1953 Adair tornado #1953 Vicksburg tornado #1955 Blackwell tornado #1955 Udall tornado #1956 Hudsonville–Standale tornado #1957 Kansas City tornado #1957 Fargo tornado # #1958 Colfax tornado #1960 Prague–Paden tornado #1964 Wichita Falls tornado #1964 Central Nebraska tornado #1965 Colome tornado #1966 Candlestick Park tornado #1966 Topeka tornado #1966 Belmond tornado #1967 Palluel tornado #1968 Wheelers­burg–Gallipolis tornado #1968 Charles City tornado #1968 Oelwein–Maynard tornado #1968 Tracy tornado #1970 Lubbock tornado #1971 Inverness tornado #1973 San Justo tornado #1973 Valley Mills tornado #1974 Depauw–Daisy Hill tornado #1974 Xenia tornado #1974 Brandenburg tornado #1974 Sayler Park tornado #1974 First Tanner tornado #1974 Second Tanner tornado #1974 Guin tornado #1976 Spiro tornado #1976 Brownwood tornado #1976 Jordan tornado #1977 Birmingham tornado #1982 Messer–Golden–Broken Bow tornado #1984 Barneveld–Black Earth tornado #1985 Niles–Wheatland tornado #1990 Hesston tornado #1990 Goessel tornado #1990 Plainfield tornado #1991 Andover tornado #1992 Chandler–Lake Wilson tornado #1996 Oakfield tornado #1997 Jarrell tornado #1998 Birmingham tornado #1998 Lawrence County tornado #1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado #2007 Greensburg tornado #2007 Elie tornado #2008 Parkersburg–New Hartford tornado #2011 Philadelphia tornado #2011 Smithville tornado #2011 Hackleburg–Phil Campbell tornado #2011 Rainsville tornado #2011 Joplin tornado #2013 Moore tornado ===Possible F5/EF5 tornadoes officially rated lower=== The process to rate tornadic damage is often difficult. Because of the difficulty, the official ratings of tornadoes are sometimes questioned by others. These may be questioned by other meteorologists, universities and colleges, as well as independent studies published in academic journals. ====Previously rated F5/EF5 tornadoes or rated F5/EF5 by others==== This is a list of tornadoes.
