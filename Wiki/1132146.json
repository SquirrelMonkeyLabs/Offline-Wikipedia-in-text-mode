 "text": "Ruiz's rocket frog (Hyloxalus ruizi) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests and cloud forests near streams. It only lives in forests that have never been cut down. Scientists saw these frogs between 2410 and 2469 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists think this frog's tadpoles swim in streams but they are not sure. ==Danger== Scientists saw six of these frogs in 1979. Since then, scientists have looked for frogs near the frog's home, but they never saw it again. Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People cut down too many trees to build farms and make places for cows to eat grass. Pig farms put bad chemicals into the water, which can hurt frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
