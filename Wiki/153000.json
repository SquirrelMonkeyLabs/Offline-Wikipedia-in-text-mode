 "text": "The glossy-mantled manucode (Manucodia ater) is a medium-sized bird of paradise, around 42cm long, glossed green, blue and purple black with a red iris, black bill, long tail and somewhat elongated upper breast and neck feathers. They can be found in the lowlands of New Guinea and nearby islands. They eat fruits, figs and arthropods. The glossy-mantled manucode was the first bird of paradise seen by the French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson, who was the first westerner to see live wild birds of paradise. San Diego Zoo has the only captive individual of this species outside of New Guinea. == References == * Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concern Category:Manucodia Category:Birds of Oceania",
