 "text": "Lobo is an American adult web cartoon featuring Lobo. Like the comics, it is filled with strong language, sexual content and graphic violence. It aired online from June 15th, 2000 to October 2000. This show was one of two webseries apart of the DCAU. Known for being an unusual piece of DCAU media due to its target audiences being more towards adults and unsuitable content for its usual target audiences, this show was intended to be as a TV-Y7-FV show on Kids WB but was converted to a TV-MA webseries due to it not being suitable for a younger demographic. ==Cast== *Greg Eagles as Lobo (episodes 1-5) *Kevin Michael Richardson as Lobo (episodes 6-14), Fat Whutzat and Sniff *Grey DeLisle as Darlene and the Nutcracker Sisters *Tom Kenny as Sunny Jim (episodes 3-5), Stumpy, Major Snake and Snake *Dee Bradley Baker as Sunny Jim (episodes 1-2) and Tubo Category:2000 American television series debuts Category:2000 American television series endings Category:2000s American animated television series Category:Adult animated television series Category:DC Animated Universe Category:Supervillain television shows Category:Web series",
