 "text": "Seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a chemical compound made of seaborgium, carbon, and oxygen. It is a coordination complex where carbonyl ligands are connected to the central seaborgium atom. == Preparation == Seaborgium hexacarbonyl is made similarly to molybdenum hexacarbonyl and tungsten hexacarbonyl, by reacting seaborgium atoms with carbon monoxide. The instability of seaborgium means that it cannot be made in large amounts. == Uses == Seaborgium is a transactinide element. The most stable isotope of seaborgium is with a half- life of a little less than ten minutes. This makes seaborgium compounds too unstable for any use outside research. Seaborgium hexacarbonyl was prepared to study the effects of relativity on electrons in superheavy elements. == Sources == Category:Transactinide compounds Category:Carbonyl complexes Category:Group 6 (Chromium group) compounds",
