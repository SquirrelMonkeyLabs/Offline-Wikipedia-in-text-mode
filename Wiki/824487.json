 "text": "A jazz guitar is a type of electric guitar. It is a type of guitar used in the various genres which are commonly called \"jazz\". The jazz-type guitar was born as a result of using electric amplification to increase the volume of conventional acoustic guitars. When guitarists in big bands only had acoustic guitars, all they could do was play chords; they could not play solos because the acoustic guitar is not a loud instrument. Category:Guitars",
