 "text": "The M45 is a motorway in the West Midlands, England. It links the M1 with the A45 south of Rugby. The A45 then goes on into Coventry, Solihull, and Birmingham. The motorway is about long. It is not very busy, mostly because many people use the M6 instead. ==Junctions== {| style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em; color:black; font-size:95%;\" class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#0080d0; text-align:center; color:white; font-size:120%;\" | colspan=\"5\" | M45 motorway junctions |- !scope=col|miles !scope=col|km !scope=col abbr=\"Westbound\"|Northbound exits (A carriageway) !scope=col|Junction !scope=col abbr=\"Eastbound\"|Southbound exits (B carriageway) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |7.7 |12.4 | Coventry, Rugby, A45 Dunchurch B4429 | J1 | Start of motorway |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |6.0 |9.7 | No access | |Daventry A45 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |0.1 |0.2 | Start of motorway | M1, J17 | The south, Northampton M1 |- |colspan=5|Notes *Distances in kilometres and carriageway identifiers are obtained from driver location signs/location marker posts.
