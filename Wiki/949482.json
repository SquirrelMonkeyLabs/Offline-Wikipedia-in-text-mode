The US Government recognizes Passamaquoddy Tribe as a tribe. == History == Passamaquoddy had oral history. This means they spoke about their past history and family stories. They also made pictures and drawings. They lived more inland during winter and hunted in the winter. In the summer, they stayed near the coast. Here they went fishing. Passamaquoddy were involved in the fur trade. They were independent. They also had peaceful relations with French and English for many decades. Many Passamaquoddy died from European diseases. Settlers forced Natives off the land. The Passamaquoddy supported the Americans in the American Revolution. After the war, the Natives were only allowed to stay in the Indian Township Reservation in Washington County, Maine (Treaty of 1794). == Maps == Maps showing the approximate locations of areas occupied by members of the Wabanaki Confederacy (from north to south): Image:The_Mi'kmaq.png|MiêžŒkmaq Image:Wohngebiet_Maliseet.png|Maliseet, Passamaquoddy Image:Wohngebiet_Oestlicheabenaki.png|Eastern Abenaki (Penobscot, Kennebec, Arosaguntacook, Pigwacket/Pequawket) Image:Wohngebiet_Westlicheabenaki.png|Western Abenaki (Arsigantegok, Missisquoi, Cowasuck, Sokoki, Pennacook == References == Category:Native Americans",
