 "text": "Biscotti is an Italian type of almond biscuit. It originated from the Tuscan city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy, and may be dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo. Biscotti is also known as cantucci. == History == === Italy === Although commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, biscotti di Prato, in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name \"cantuccini\". These names sound similar to other regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in Tuscany, but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of yeasts, acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and anise seeds. The confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of \"Biscottificio Antonio Mattei,\" the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop: \"Manufacturers of cantuccini,\" which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits. The sign has remained unchanged, and after such a long time people are accustomed to associate the name \"cantuccini\" with the biscuits typical of Sardinia and Sicily. == Preparation == Biscotti is made with flour, sugar, eggs and almonds or pine nuts. Sometimes they have a layer of glaze, usually chocolate. == References == Category:Cookies Category:Italian food",
