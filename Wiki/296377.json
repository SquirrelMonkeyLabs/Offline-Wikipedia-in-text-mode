 "text": "Hominini is the tribe of african apes that comprises humans (Homo), and all ancestors of Homo sapiens back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with Sahelanthropus as a key fossil.Wood B. 2010. Reconstructing human evolution: achievements, challenges, and opportunities. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107: 8902–8909. A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus Pan (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the \"human\" branch, including genus Homo and its close relatives, but not Pan. All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species. ==Genera== Subtribe Panina *Pan (chimpanzees) Subtribe Hominina *Homo (humans) *†Paranthropus *†Australopithecus *†Sahelanthropus *†Orrorin *†Ardipithecus *†Kenyanthropus ==References== Category:Hominids Category:Apes",
