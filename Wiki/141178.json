 "text": "Altaic is a language system that includes the Turkic languages, Mongolic, and the Tungusic languages. That is probably the meaning attributed to \"Altaic\" by most general linguists. It has disputed language families, but only a few linguists still believe that it existed. It supposedly had 66 languagesAltaic languages that are now spoken by about 348 million people, mostly in and around Central Asia and northeast Asia.Altaic Language Family Tree Ethnologue report for Altaic. However, since the publication of Gustaf John Ramstedt's Einführung in 1952–1957, most Altaicists have included Korean in Altaic. Since the publication of Roy Andrew Miller's Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages in 1971, some also included Japanese (Nicholas Poppe) or Japonic, consisting of Japanese and Ryukyuan. A few linguists (such as (Street 1962)) even count Ainu with the Altaic languagesGeorg, S., Michalove, P.A., Manaster Ramer, A., Sidwell, P.J.: \"Telling general linguists about Altaic\", Journal of Linguistics 35 (1999): 65-98 Online abstract but as part of a node including Korean and Japanese, in contrast to a Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic node, with Korean-Japanese-Ainu and Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic, in turn, forming a higher- level node. The core version of Altaic, consisting of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, is sometimes referred to as \"Micro-Altaic,\" and the expanded version, including Korean and sometimes Japanese, is referred to as \"Macro- Altaic,\" but even the core version is very controversial. == References == == Other websites == * Altaic family tree Ethnologue * Altaic languages MSN Encarta * Monumenta altaica Altaic linguistics website * Altaic etymology section in StarLing databases * Defense of Altaic by Alexis Manaster Ramer (1994) Category:Languages",
