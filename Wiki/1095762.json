 "text": "The Grenadier Guards are a foot guards regiment of the British Army. They are famous because they are the most senior Infantry regiment regularly responsible for guarding His Majesty The King. == History == The regiment's history starts in 1656, with the formation of Lord Wentworth's Regiment. This regiment combined with John Russell's Regiment of Guards in 1665 to form the 1st Regiment of Foot. For over 300 years, the Grenadier Guards have fought in many large conflicts, such as the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, World War I and World War II. == Traditions == As one of the 5 foot guards regiments, the Grenadier Guards often mount the King's Guard. This also means the Grenadier Guards appoint lance sergeants instead of full corporals. Category:British Army regiments",
