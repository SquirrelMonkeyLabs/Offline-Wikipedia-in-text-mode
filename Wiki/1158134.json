 "text": "Purugupta was a king of the Gupta dynasty who ruled northern India from 467 to 473 CE. He was the son of Emperor Kumaragupta I and Queen Anantadevi. Purugupta became emperor after the reign of his half-brother Skandagupta. There are no records directly left by Purugupta, but historians have learned about him from other sources. These include the Bhitari silver-copper seal of his grandson Kumaragupta III and clay seals linked to his sons Narasimhagupta and Budhagupta. An inscription on a Buddha image found at Sarnath shows that Kumaragupta II succeeded him as emperor. == References == Category:India Category:Gupta Empire Category:Gupta emperors",
