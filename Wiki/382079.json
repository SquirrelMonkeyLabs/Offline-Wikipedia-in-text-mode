 "text": "Radioactive contamination or radiological contamination is the contamination of the environment with radioactive materials, where these materials are not present. Many radioactive substances have very long half lives; this means that if they are present in the envioroment, they can be dangerous for a very long time. Many nuclear power plants produce such substances; usually they are processed to radioactive waste. There is little danger that comes from radioactive waste,if it is stored safely. ==Causes== *Incidents in nuclear power plants *Nuclear medicine uses radiation for the treatment of illnesses. Sometimes, there are accidents. *Explosions in nuclear facilities (and atomic bombs) cause nuclear fallouts: This means that nuclear particles are scattered using normal atmospheric phenomena, such as the weather *Nuclear reprocessing can contaminate water ==Accidents== Year Type Incident ARS deaths ARS survivors Location 1945 criticality Harry K.
