 "text": "Progymnosperms are ancient plants that don't exist anymore. They were like woody plants with spores and probably came from trimerophytes. Later, they led to the development of gymnosperms, which are the ancestors of acrogymnosperms and angiosperms (flowering plants). People sometimes call them Progymnospermophyta or Progymnospermopsida. ==References== ==Other websites== *Progymnospermophyta *Botany: an introduction to plant biology Category:Seed plants Category:Fossil plants Category:Extinct plants",
