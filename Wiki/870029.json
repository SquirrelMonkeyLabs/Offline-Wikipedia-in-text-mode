 "text": "Lsjbot is a controversial Wikipedia bot invented by Swedish physicist Sverker Johannson. It was originally invented for the Swedish Wikipedia, but later expanded to the Waray and Cebuano Wikipedias. The bot auto-creates articles, primarily about geography, plant and animal species, the Solar System and natural features such as lakes, rivers and mountains. Due to Lsjbot, the Swedish, Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias all have over 1 million articles. The bot is now inactive on the Swedish and Waray Wikipedias and while it remains active on the Cebuano Wikipedia, there currently are no mass-creation projects for articles on the wiki, according to Sverker himself. Some critics of the bot claim that the bot lacks the \"human touch\" that other articles written by others include, but Sverker denies those claims. ==Related pages== * Sverker Johannson, developer of the bot == Other websites == * Lsjbot account on Swedish Wikiepedia Category:Wikipedia bots",
