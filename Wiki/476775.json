 "text": "Asecs, earlier A6 center, is a shopping mall in the town of Jönköping in Sweden. The shopping mall was opened on 2 April 1987. That was following the 1985 disestablishment of the Småland Artillery Regiment. The shopping mall is located on both the northern and the southern side of the E4 motorway. These parts are connected with a covered bridge that spans across the motorway. Major parts of the shopping mall are located at this bridge. The bridge also housed a McDonald’s restaurant until 2019. From that restaurant, the motorway can be seen. The mall changed its name spelling-wise to Asecs on 26 October 2017. Asecs can also be reached by train. The closest stationen is at Rocksjön. == References == ==Other websites== *official website Category:Buildings and structures in Jönköping Category:Malls",
