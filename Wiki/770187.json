 "text": "In the U.S. state of Maryland, recreational adult use of Cannabis is legal from July 1, 2023. Cannabis is a plant that changes how you think and act when you use it. Cannabis has been legal for medical use since 2014. Since 2014, having 10 grams of cannabis or less meant getting a small penalty. Those who are allowed to use marijuana as a therapy can to visit a dispensary, a place where marijuana is sold. The government organization that regulates the program is known as the \"Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission\", or \"MMCC\".If marijuana products are not covered under an insurance plan, they must be paid for in cash. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the MMCC changed laws and rules about buying medical cannabis to make getting it easier by putting into place social-distancing guidelines, including allowing home- delivery. == History == Like in most U.S. states, marijuana possession, use, manufacturing, and distribution had harsh penalties historically. In 2010, about half of all arrests made were for possession of cannabis. In Maryland, African-Americans were about 3 times more likely than Caucasians to be arrested for the possession of marijuana, even though usage of cannabis is similar for most racial populations. African-Americans have received harsher penalties for similar charges than other minority groups. A referendum on whether or not cannabis should be legalized in Maryland for adults was held in Maryland in November 2022. == Laws == Possession of 10 grams of cannabis flower or less can hold a civil offense penalty with a fine not to exceed $100. Having more than 10 grams but below 50 pounds (about 22 kilograms) can have a penalty of a $1,000 fine and up to one year in incarceration. == Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC) == The MMCC is the overseeing body of Maryland's medical marijuana program. Governor Martin O'Malley signed legislation that established a medical marijuana program in Maryland in May of 2013. It is named in honor of Maryland Delegate Cheryl D. Glenn's mother who died of kidney cancer at age 87. It is believed that Glenn's mother would have benefitted from medical marijuana therapy. Doctors, nurses, dentists, podiatrists and midwives may permit patients to use and purchase marijuana. ==References== Category:Cannabis Category:Maryland",
