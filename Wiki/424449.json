 "text": "Kapilavastu (Kapilavatthu) is the name of the place where Gautama Buddha grew up, and where his family home was located. It was located in the ancient Shakya kingdom. The exact location of Kapilavastu is not known; it is assumed to be about 10 kilometers to the west of Lumbini, where Buddha was born. Buddha spent the first 29 years of his life in the area of Kapilavastu. There are now two sites near the border between Nepal and India which might have been Kapilavastu â€” Tilaurakot in Nepal and Piprahwa in Uttar Pradesh, India. ==References== Category:Buddhism",
