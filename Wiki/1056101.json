 "text": "Abu Obaida (Arabic: أبو عبيدة) also spelled as Abu Obayda, Abu Ubayda and Abu Ubaydah, is the war name of a Palestinian who is the spokesperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian organization Hamas since 2006. He was nicknamed Abu Ubaidah after the companion of Mohammad who conquered Jerusalem, Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, who lived during the reign of Caliph Umar. ==Identity== Abu Obaida appeared for the first time as official spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades in 2004 but he gained spotlight when he announced the capture of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by the Al- Qassam Brigades in 2006. He was previously seen on screen as a field official between 2002-2004, but his identity remains unknown and his face does not appear in the media as he covers his face with a Keffiyeh for security purpose. Palestinian reports indicate that his face is known only to a small number of people. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has reported multiple times that they have revealed Abu Obeida's identity but Hamas has denied the claims citing propaganda. == Related pages == * Abu Khaled * Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades * Al-Quds Brigades * Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades ==References== Category:Living people Category:Palestinian nationalists Category:People from the Gaza Strip Category:Hamas Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Hamas people",
