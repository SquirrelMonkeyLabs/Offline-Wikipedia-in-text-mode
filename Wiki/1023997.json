 "text": "Kirby's Dream Buffet is a party video game for the Nintendo Switch. It is a spin-off game in the Kirby series. It was released on August 17, 2022. ==Gameplay== The game can be played by more than one player. The player is Kirby, who rolls around and eats strawberries. The goal is to eat as much strawberries as possible in the shortest amount of time. === Play modes === There are three play modes that the player can choose from the main menu. ==== Battle Mode ==== In this mode, the game can be played in singleplayer (against CPU) or in multiplayer (against a real player who is in the same room). The maximum number of players is two. ==== Online Mode ==== This mode cannot be played by one person. Here, the player connects to the Internet and can play with unknown people. He can also play with a friend who is far away by using a password. ==== Local Play Mode ==== Local Play Mode allows playing wirelessly with nearby Nintendo Switches. To play together, everyone has to have his own Nintendo Switch. The maximum number of players is four. === Types of matches === In the whole game there are 4 match options to choose from. ==== Gourmet Grand Prix ==== In this case, the match starts with a Single Race. Then, Kirby must fight in a Single Minigame. After that, another Single Race starts. The Gourmet Grand Prix ends on a Battle Royale, after which the winner of the match is chosen. ==== Single Race ==== Single race is composed of an obstacle course. Players fight to be the first Kirby that eats the biggest cake. ===== Single Minigame ===== A Minigame is always played on a small, flat surface. The strawberries can fall in boxes or randomly appear in some places. Kirbys will often push each other, which makes it harder to navigate (control). ===== Single Battle Royale ===== A Battle Royale is a match in which Kirbys try to push each other off the map while eating strawberries at the same time. Every time a player is pushed off the board, the Kirby who has done this steals many strawberries from the Kirby who has fallen. Copy food abilities are used here very often. == References == Category:2022 video games Category:Kirby Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Nintendo Switch-only games Category:Party video games Category:Video games about food and drink Category:Video games developed in Japan",
