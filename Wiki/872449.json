The den of Arabism is a sacred sanctuary, and the throne of the suns is a preserve that will not be subjugated. 𝄆 The quarters of Levant are towers in height, which are in dialogue with the zenith of the skies. 𝄇 A land resplendent with brilliant suns, becoming another sky or almost a sky. II The flutter of hopes and the beat of the heart, are on a flag that united the entire country. Is there not blackness from every eye, and ink from every martyr's blood? 𝄆 [Our] spirits are defiant and [our] history is glorious, and our martyrs' souls are formidable guardians. 𝄇 From us is al-Walīd, and from us is al-Rashīd. So why then shall we not lead, why then shall we not rise? I Guardians of homeland, upon you be peace, our ever-proud souls refuse to be seized. The den of Arabism is our sacred home, and the throne of our suns will never go down. 𝄆 The mountains of Syria are towers in height, which talk with the zenith of the highest skies. 𝄇 A land that is splendid with brilliant sun, turning to a sky or almost a sky. II The flutter of our hopes and the beats of our hearts, depicted on the flag that united our land. Did we not derive the black from every man's eye, and from ink of martyrs' blood wrote to the tall sky? 𝄆 Spirits defiant and past so glorious, and the martyrs' souls are our guardians. 𝄇 From us, a nation of souls and bravery, Thy glory comes from us, my homeland! == References == == Other websites == *http://nationalanthems.info/sy.htm Category:Syrian culture Category:Asian anthems Category:1936 works",
