Probably, one of the best known works of the language is Wulfila's translation of the Bible, known as the Wulfila Bible or Gothic Bible or Codex Argenteus. The translation was done in the 3rd century. == Other websites == * Project Wulfila , studies the Gothic language. ==References== Category:Germanic languages Category:Languages of Europe Category:Extinct languages",
