The company doesn't have a physical headquarters and all the employees work from home. In 2020, Coinbase decided to close its San Francisco office and operate entirely remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was a trend seen in many other tech companies at the time. == References == Category:Cryptocurrency Category:American financial companies",
