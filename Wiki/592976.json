 "text": "Mateo Flecha (Catalan: Mateu Fletxa; 1481–1553) was a composer born in Kingdom of Aragon, in the region of Prades. He is sometimes known as \"El Viejo\" (the elder) to distinguish him from another composer of madrigals, his nephew, Mateo Flecha \"El Joven\" (the younger). \"El Viejo\" is best known for his ensaladas, published in Prague in 1581 by the same nephew. ==Bibliography== * Las Ensaladas (Praga, 1581), con un suplemento de obras del género.
