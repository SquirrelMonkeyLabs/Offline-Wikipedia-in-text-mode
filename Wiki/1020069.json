 "text": "The East Lancs Spryte was a single-decker body of a bus, It had a low-floor, It was built from 1996 to 2001 by East Lancashire Coachbuilders. It was built on the Dennis Dart SLF chassis, Volvo B6LE chassis and Volvo B6BLE chassis. Some Sprytes were builded as buses and some were custom-made into incident command units and exhibition buses. East Lancs misspelled bus names on purpose (naming it \"Spryte\" instead of \"Sprite\"). In 1999 it was replaced by the single-decker Myllennium.
