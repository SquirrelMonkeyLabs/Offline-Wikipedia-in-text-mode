 "text": "The Canal de Bourgogne (English: Burgundy Canal) is a canal in Burgundy in east-central France. It is 242 km (150 miles) long, with 189 locks. It connects the Yonne at Migennes with the Saône at Saint-Jean-de-Losne. It was built between 1775 and 1832. It makes a link between the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea, from the rivers Seine and the Yonne to the Saône and Rhône. In the North it follows the valley of the Armançon river. There is a 3-kilometre long tunnel at its highest point, at Pouilly-en-Auxois, only wide enough for one-way traffic. == References == Category:Canals in France Category:Bourgogne-Franche-Comté",
