 "text": "The Capture of Delhi was a major battle between the Bengali Sepoys and British Raj. This event would lead to the beginning of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. == Background == After several years of tension between the Sepoys of the Bengal army and the East India Company, the sepoys at Meerut rebelled against their British officers. The main cause for this was due to the introduction of the Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle. The cartridges for this gun was greased with a mixture of cow and pig lard. This would defile both Hindu and Muslim soldiers. == Battle == Later in the morning, the rebels from Meerut arrived unexpectedly by crossing a bridge by boats all over the Jumna River. The leading soldiers of the 3rd Light Cavalry halted under the windows of the Palace and called on the Mughal Emperor to lead them. Bahadur Shah II called for them to go to another palace outside the city, where their case would be heard later. After this, the Sepoys would sack and loot surrounding areas and over half of the Europeans in Delhi would flee. Around 52 British men who were trying to hide were found and executed. == Aftermath == Although the Sepoy troops successfully took over and sacked Delhi, It would be retaken by British troops on June 8 â€“ September 21, 1857. ==References==",
