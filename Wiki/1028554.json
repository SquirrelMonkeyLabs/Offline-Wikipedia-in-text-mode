It lives in the east part of the Himalaya mountains in India, Tibet, Bangladesh, and China and in the Annam Mountains in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It also lives in parts of Thailand and Myanmar. This frog lives in trees in forests where the branches come together like a roof. People have also seen them in fruit tree farms. The female frog makes a nest out of foam. She makes the nest on tree branches over shallow water. The tadpoles swim in pools of rainwater and in parts of streams where the water does not move. People have seen this frog between 100 and 2200 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. At least one of the places the frog lives is a protected park: Royal Manas National Park. People cutting down forests to build towns and roads may not be good for this frog. However, in Laos, scientists think there are 10-30% fewer of this frog than before because human beings have changed the places where it lives. Sometimes people catch this frog to sell as a pet. People in India catch the frog to eat and use in medicines. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
