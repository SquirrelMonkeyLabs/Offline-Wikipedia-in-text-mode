 "text": "A voice recorder or a dictation machine is a device to record speech or other sounds, and then play it back. Starting in the early 20th century they were much used in business. Usually a typist played the recording and transcribed it. In the late 20th century dictation machines used microcassettes. Today, smartphones can do their job. Category:Audio technology",
