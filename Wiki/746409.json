Its capital is Mitú. It borders Brazil on the east. Because of its location in the Amazon jungle, it has no roads connecting it with the rest of the country or internally from settlement to settlement. Commerce and contact with the outside world is done through travel along the main rivers and by means of air travel. Several of the small settlements have airstrips with service to the department's capital, Mitú.[ Finagro; Vaupes Department] == Administrative divisions == Because of its small population and vast extension of land, Vaupés only has 3 municipalities.
