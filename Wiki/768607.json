 "text": "In Great Britain, roads are given a letter with 1–4 numbers after it. This is how they are named. The letter is the category of the road. There are two main types of categories: motorways (with the letter M) and non-motorways. There are two types of non-motorways: A roads (with the letter A) and B roads (with the letter B). A roads are more important than B roads. There are also a very small number of C roads. This system only applies to the island of Great Britain. Northern Ireland and other islands have their own systems. == Motorways (M roads) == == A roads == === Single-digit A roads === In England and Wales, the six A roads with one number are most important roads coming out of London. Starting with the A1 which goes north, numbers go clockwise around London: * A1 – London to Edinburgh (also known as the Great North Road) * A2 – London to Dover (the southern part of Watling Street, also known as the Dover Road; though the A2 past Rochester has been replaced by the M2) * A3 – London to Portsmouth (also known as the Portsmouth Road) * A4 – London to Avonmouth (also known as the Great West Road or the Bath Road; though this route is not used anymore to travel far since the M4 was built) * A5 – London to Holyhead (the Northern part of Watling Street) * A6 – Luton to Carlisle (the A6 first started in Barnet on the old A1) In Scotland, important roads from Edinburgh have A roads with one number: * A7 – Edinburgh to Carlisle (though the M74 and M8 motorways now are mainly used) * A8 – Edinburgh to Greenock (used to link Edinburgh to Glasgow, but it now ends and carries on as the M8 away from Glasgow) * A9 – Falkirk to Scrabster (first went from Edinburgh to Inverness) === Other A roads === *Zone 1 A roads *Zone 2 A roads *Zone 3 A roads *Zone 4 A roads *Zone 5 A roads *Zone 6 A roads *Zone 7 A roads *Zone 8 A roads *Zone 9 A roads == B roads == *Zone 1 B roads *Zone 2 B roads *Zone 3 B roads *Zone 4 B roads *Zone 5 B roads *Zone 6 B roads *Zone 7 B roads *Zone 8 B roads *Zone 9 B roads == References == Category:Roads in the United Kingdom",
