In September 2023, allegations of grooming were made against Yandere Simulator developer Alex Mahan. Mahan would later admit to having inappropriate conversations with a minor but denied the grooming accusations. After the allegations were made public, many of the other developers and voice actors for the game left, including Michaela Laws, the voice of Ayano Aishi. The game's development then went downhill. == References == Category:Upcoming video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Indie video games Category:Life simulation games Category:Manga series Category:Sandbox games Category:Simulation video games Category:Stealth video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games",
