 "text": "Social drinking is the name for the consumption of alcoholic drinks in a social setting; people who are social drinkers do this with friends. Many cultures frown upon isolating people because they drink alcohol, and because they may have a problem with alcohol dependence. People meet to celebrate an occasion, which also permits them to drink alcohol without being frowned upon. Category:Alcohol drinking habits Category:Leisure",
