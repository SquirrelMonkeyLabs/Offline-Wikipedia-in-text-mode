 "text": "Air France Flight 4590 was a Concorde flight operated by Air France that crashed on 25 July 2000. The flight was supposed to go from Paris to New York City. Shortly after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport, the airplane crashed into a hotel in a suburb in nearby Gonesse, killing all 109 people on board plus 4 people on the ground. The crash was caused by a piece of metal on the runway from a DC-10 that punctured one of the airplane's fuel tanks. This led to an engine fire, and the airplane lost power in its engines. The aircraft lost control due to the fire and crashed. This accident led to the temporary grounding of the Concorde fleet and changes in how the airplane was operated. The Concorde also decreased in popularity from the crash. ==References== Category:2000 in Europe Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the 2000s",
