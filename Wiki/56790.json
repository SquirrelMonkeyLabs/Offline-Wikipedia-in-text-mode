For several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s, she was known simply as Roseanne. By 2005, she had resumed referring to herself by her maiden name. She is best known for playing Roseanne Conner on the television series Roseanne. The self-titled series was rebooted in 2018 on ABC with record ratings. A second season of the reboot (what would have been season 11) was eventually ordered. However, ABC cancelled the series after Barr posted a tweet mentioning Valerie Jarrett (an aide to President Barack Obama) that was viewed as racist. ==Television work== * Rodney Dangerfield: It's Not Easy Bein' Me (1986) * On Location: The Roseanne Barr Show (1987) * Roseanne (1988â€“97, 2018) * Backfield in Motion (1991) * The Rosey and Buddy Show (1992) (voice; unsold pilot) * The Woman Who Loved Elvis (1993) * General Hospital (cast member in 1994) * The Roseanne Show (1998-2000) * The Brothers Garcia (2001) * The Real Roseanne Show (2003) (cancelled after 1 episode) * Roseanne Barr: Blonde and Bitchin' (2006) * My Name Is Earl (2006) * The Search For The Funniest Mom In America 3 (2007) * Roseanne's Nuts * Portlandia * The Office ==Filmography== * She-Devil (1989) * Look Who's Talking Too (1990) (voice) * Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) * Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) * Dancing Outlaw II: Jesco Goes to Hollywood (1994) (documentary) * Unzipped (1995) (documentary) * Blue in the Face (1995) * Meet Wally Sparks (1997) * Get Bruce (1999) (documentary) * Cecil B.
