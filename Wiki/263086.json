 "text": "Amides are two related groups of chemical compounds, both derived from ammonia and amines. == Organic amides == In organic chemistry, amides are related to carboxylic acids. Organic amides are also called carboxamides. Replacing the hydroxyl group of a carboyxlic acid with an amino group gives the amide of that acid: for example, acetic acid becomes acetamide . One or more of the hydrogens on the amino group can also be replaced with other organic groups. If more than one acyl group is connected to the nitrogen atom, the amide can be called a secondary or tertiary amide. == Inorganic amides == Inorganic amides have inorganic cations bonded to the nitrogen atom of an amine. This bond can be covalent or ionic. The ion is also referred to as \"amide\" or \"azanide\", and is made by deprotonating ammonia with a strong base. This is ammonia acting as an acid, although a very weak one. Because ammonia is a weak acid, inorganic amides are strong bases. Sodium amide is an example of an inorganic amide. ==Related pages== *Sodium azide *Azide *Nitrate ==References== Category:Nitrogen compounds Category:Functional groups",
