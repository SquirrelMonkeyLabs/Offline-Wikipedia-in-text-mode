 "text": "Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges (7 November 1799 â€“ 23 December 1875) was a French writer. He was born in Paris on 7 November 1799 and died there on 23 December 1875. He was one of the most prolific librettists of the 19th century. He joined with others to write the librettos for the ballet Giselle by Adolphe Adam, for the opera La fille du regiment by Donizetti, and the opera La jolie fille de Perth for Bizet. He wrote over seventy works for the stage. He wrote novels. He liked plot twists and unlikely coincidences. His works are short on convincing characterizations. He was old-fashioned, dressing in 18th century style. Category:Writers from Paris Category:Librettists Category:1799 births Category:1875 deaths",
