 "text": "Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet (16 November 1896 â€“ 3 December 1980) was a British fascist politician. He rose to fame in the 1920s as a Member of Parliament and later became disillusioned with mainstream politics. He became the leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Mosley was the sixth baronet to hold the title, which had been in his family for over a century. After belonging to both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, Mosley set up his \"New Party\", which became the British Union of Fascists. He was anti-semitic (against jews), and there were street riots in London and Leicester in 1935. Mosley was interned in May 1940, and the BUF was banned. He was released in 1943. Internment is putting people in prison to prevent their being able to act against the national interest. Its main use is to protect public safety. It has not been done in Britain since WWII. Disgraced by his association with fascism, Mosley moved abroad in 1951. He spent most of the rest of his life in Paris. == References == Category:1896 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs Category:Leaders of political parties in the United Kingdom Category:Fascists",
