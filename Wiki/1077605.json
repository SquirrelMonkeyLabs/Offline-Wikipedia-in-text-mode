 "text": "Sauer's bush frog (Philautus saueri) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia. People have seen it near Pakka Cave and near Mount Kinabalu. People have seen it between 2200 and 3500 meters above sea level. This frog is not in danger of dying out, even though it only lives in one small place. This is because most of the frog's home is inside protected parks where human beings are not allowed to build roads or buildings or harm the animals. Scientists have seen this frog's eggs and young inside the water in pitcher plants. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
