 "text": "The National Hockey League's Pacific Division is one of two divisions that make up the Western Conference. It was formed in 1993 as part of league realignment. The Pacific Division is the surviving successor of the Smythe Division; the now-defunct Northwest Division was the other successor. Of Pacific Division teams that existed in 1993, only the Anaheim Ducks never played in the Smythe Division (the Arizona Coyotes played in the Smythe when they were the original Winnipeg Jets). The Pacific Division is centered around the Southwestern United States and Western Canada, with three teams based in California, two in Alberta, and one each in Arizona, British Columbia, and Nevada. The San Jose Sharks have the most Pacific Division titles, with six. Five Stanley Cup winners have come from the Pacific Division: the Stars in 1999, the Colorado Avalanche in 1996, the Anaheim Ducks in 2007, and the Los Angeles Kings in 2012 and 2014. ==Division
