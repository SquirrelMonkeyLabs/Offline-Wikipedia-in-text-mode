The United States attempted to extradite him to face charges there. === Extradition hearing === During Love's two day extradition hearing on 28 and 29 June 2016 at the Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, his father, Reverend Alexander Love, testified that Lauri Love has Asperger's syndrome and so should not be extradited. Also at the hearing, Simon Baron-Cohen, a psychologist, testified that Love should not be extradited because of his diagnosed disorders, which also include eczema, psychosis, and depression. On 16 September 2016, at Westminster Magistrates' Court a judge ruled that Love could be extradited to the United States. Love's solicitor Karen Todner said that they would appeal, and on 5 February 2018, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley, at the High Court, upheld his appeal against extradition, while ruling that it would \"not be oppressive [to] prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences\". == References == Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Extradition",
