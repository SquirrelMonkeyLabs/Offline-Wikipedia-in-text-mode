 "text": "The forint (sign Ft; code HUF) is the currency of Hungary. It was formerly divided into 100 fillér, but fillér coins are no longer in circulation. The introduction of the forint on 1 August 1946 was a crucial step in the post- World War II stabilisation of the Hungarian economy, and the currency remained relatively stable until the 1980s. Transition to a market economy in the early 1990s made the forint less valuable; inflation peaked at 35% in 1991. BBC News Hungary lifts last currency restrictions. 18 June 2001 As a member of the European Union, the long-term aim of the Hungarian government may be to replace the forint with the euro, although under the current government there is no target date for adopting the euro. ==References== Category:Currency of Europe Category:Hungary",
