 "text": "\"L'Abidjanaise\" (\"The Abidjanaise\") is the national anthem of Ivory Coast. ==Lyrics== French original (official) Nouchi lyrics (by Nash du Gbonhi) Baoul√© lyrics English translation I We salute you, o land of hope, Country of hospitality; Thy full gallant legions Have restored thy dignity. Beloved Ivory Coast, thy sons, Proud builders of thy greatness, All gathered together for thy glory, In joy will we construct thee. Proud Ivorians, the country calls us. If we have brought back liberty peacefully, It will be our duty to be an example Of the hope promised to humanity, In building, united in the new faith The homeland of true brotherhood. II To you, noble Ivory Coast, O great country of good people! We bring in victory, The homage of our ardent hearts. In the friendship of the brotherly peoples, God guides us to the ideal, Subject to the motto: Union, labour, discipline. For your greatness, rich and noble homeland, We will walk forward, full of love and full of faith. From united hearts, during our life, We will work in honour for the just right, Of hearts united during our life, With your calls we will all be present. III To all our fellow travellers, At the dawn of this fallen day, So that there is no longer any doubt, But faith, fraternity. To all our elite battalions, In the tomb today, O whole people repetitions: Love, honour, fidelity. IV And let your flag unite us, May your love strengthen us, Because for you alone we want to live, And for you fight and die. And you, proud and noble youth, From all known horizons, Always follow this wisdom, of our elders who are no more. V To us, which animates hope, In your bright future, Always restore the insurance, To lead us into happy people. And we will go around the world, Sow your name and your benefits, By clamouring on all the waves, That on your soil reigns peace. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Ivorian culture",
