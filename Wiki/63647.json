 "text": "Miss Universe is an international beauty contest. It was started in 1952 and today has over 190 countries taking part. About one billion people watch it on television every year. The competition was first shown on American national television in 1955. In 1960, the show moved from California to Florida. Until 1971, the competition was held in the United States, and since 1972 - every year in a new country. The pageant is owned by WME and IMG, with Fox owning the rights to broadcast the pageant on television. Until 2015, it was owned by NBC and Donald Trump. In 2015, Trump started his campaign for President of the United States and said he wanted to stop illegal immigrants from Mexico from coming into the US. NBC then stopped working with him, and so Trump bought Miss Universe out, and sold it to its current owners a few days later. == History == After winning the 1951 Miss America competition, Yolanda Betbese refused to pose in Catalina swimwear from Pacific Mills, sponsor of the competition. Because of this, in 1952 the company left the Miss America competition and organized an alternative national Miss USA competition, as well as an international Miss Universe competition. Sponsored by the American airline Pan Am and the Universal Film Studio The Miss Universe pageant was first held on June 28, 1952 in Long Beach, California. At the beginning of its existence, it was intended to promote beach fashion: for a month, applicants advertised beach products. The first winner of the Miss Universe title was 17-year-old Armi Kuusela from Finland. She was crowned with the wedding tiara of the Romanov dynasty. The competition was attended by girls from 30 countries. ==Recent Winners== Year Country/Territory Winner Venue 2023 Sheynnis Palacios San Salvador, El Salvador 2022 USA R'bonney Gabriel New Orleans, Louisiana, United States 2021 Harnaaz Sandhu Eilat, Israel 2020 Andrea Meza Hollywood, Florida, United States 2019 Zozibini Tunzi Atlanta, Georgia, United States 2018 Catriona Gray Bangkok, Thailand 2017 Demi-Leigh Tebow Las Vegas, Nevada, United States ==References== == Other websites == * Miss Universe official homepage Category:1952 establishments",
