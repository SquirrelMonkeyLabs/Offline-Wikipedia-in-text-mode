 "text": "Brahma Kumaris is a spiritual group that started in Hyderabad, Sindh in the 1930s by Lekhraj Kripalani. The organisation is known because a lot of women are part of it. They teach that a person should see themselves as a soul and not a body. They think that all souls are good and that God is where all good comes from. They want to create a worldwide understanding based on what they call \"soul-consciousness\".Religions of the World. A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices. J Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann. Facts on File Inc, 2007, In 2008, the group said that they have more than 825,000 people who come all the time, with over 8500 centres in 100 countries.Melton, J. Gordon; Baumann, Martin (2010). Religions of the World. A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices. ABC-CLEO, LLC. pp. 383–384. ISBN 9781576072233. == History == The Brahma Kumaris began as a small, caste- specific, spiritual community in Hyderabad, Sindh, India in the 1930s. The community was formally established in 1937, as a trust comprised of young women, but its formation can be traced back to 1932. The precursor to modern- day Sindh was Mohenjo-Daro. One of the world’s most ancient cities, it was the cradle of the Indus Valley. Archeological evidence indicates that region held a progressive society, a well-engineered and designed city. Socially there was equality between women and men, and very low rates of crime. By contrast, in the 1930s in some parts of Sindh many women were in purdah. Even in the contemporary world, some parts of Sindhi society expect women to wear soft shoes so they are not heard, to live behind blinds so they cannot be seen, and to move according to the instructions of a male relative. For some women, even looking at or speaking to a male outside her family is forbidden. These ideas are not native to Sindh but were adopted by Sindh locals upon arrival of Arabian culture. This tension was vibrant during the time of North West India after British colonisation, and just before the partition of India. This was crucial to the development of the Brahma Kumaris. The founder of the Brahma Kumaris was a successful middle-aged jeweler, Lekhraj Koobchand Kripalani, residing in Hyderabad (in pre-Partition India). He was of the Bhaiband caste and born into a family who were devotees of Vallabhacharya (1479-1531), a Hindu theologian and philosopher. Vallabhacharya taught Shuddha (pure) Advaita (non-dualism), an interpretation of Vedanta that rejected asceticism and monastic life, suggesting that through loving devotion to God any householder could achieve salvation. This understanding influenced the early teachings of the Brahma Kumaris and may be at the heart of its role as a social reform movement. == Beliefs == The group has made itself different to Hinduism. They see itself as spiritual teachers and not a religion.Kranenborg, Reender (1999). \"Brahma Kumaris: A New Religion?\". Center for Studies on New Religions. Retrieved 27 July 2007. \"A preliminary version of a paper presented at CESNUR 99\" The Brahma Kumaris say \"Supreme Soul\" for God. They say that God will always exist but without a physical presence. He does not go through the repeating birth, death and re-birth. God is seen as perfect. === Study () === Brahma Kumaris' members read the which is flute in Hindi. It is read to classes early each morning in most BK centres in the world.
