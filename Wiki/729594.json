 "text": "Remembrance is a drama about Royal Navy ratings of HMS Raleigh. They are about to go on a six-month naval exercise. Some well-known British actors had early roles in the film. They include Timothy Spall, Lisa Maxwell and John Altman. It was Gary Oldman's first film. It was made by Channel Four Films and was shown in the first week of Channel 4 broadcasting. It was also one of the first films in the UK to be shown on television less than three years after its initial cinema release. Before this event, a three-year delay was made by the Cinema Exhibitors' Association. == Plot == The film follows several naval ratings with the story switching between the characters. The naval ratings prepare for their coming months away at sea. The action takes place around the bars and clubs of the Union Street district of Plymouth. One major event that affects all the characters is the hospitalisation, and eventual death, of Daniel, played by Gary Oldman. This is after a violent assault by a nightclub bouncer. == Production == Gregg got the idea for the film from his own experiences as a student at Plymouth Art College. It was shot on location. It includes interior scenes in two Union Street pubs, The Phoenix and The Two Trees. The film was commissioned by Channel 4, before the channel had started broadcasting. It was shown in November 1982, close to Remembrance Sunday. This was in the first week of the new channel In June 1982, before being shown on TV, the film had been shown in a cinema, the Screen on the Hill in Hampstead.
