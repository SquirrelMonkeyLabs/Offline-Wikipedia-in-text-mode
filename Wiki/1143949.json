 "text": "The confusing poison frog (Epipedobates maculatus) is a frog. It lives in Panama. Twenty-first-century scientists are not sure where other scientists first found this frog. They think it was in a forest. They think the tadpoles swim in water. Scientists do not know if this frog is alive or dead now. They think, if it is alive, people cutting down too many trees near its home may put it in danger. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
