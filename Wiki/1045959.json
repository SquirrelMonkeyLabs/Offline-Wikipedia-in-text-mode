 "text": "Muhsin ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib was the fifth child and third son of Ali (cousin of Muhammad), and Fatimah (daughter of Muhammad). He was the younger brother of Hasan ibn Ali, Hussain ibn Ali, Zainab bint Ali, and Umm Kulthum, and the grandson of Muhammad and Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, as well as the grandson of Abu Talib and Fatimah Bint Asad. He was supposed to be born in the year 632. However, an alleged incident occurred in Shia sources in which Umar killed Fatimah's fetus by dropping a door on her, causing the death of Muhsin. After this, Ali allegedly fought with with Umar but did not kill him, as doing so might have escalated tensions with protesters led by Abu Bakr. Subsequently, the miscarriage of Muhsin allegedly contributed to the death of Fatimah, who passed away later in 632. However, many Sunnis believe that Mushin died of natural causes during birth and Umar did not kill Mushin or was any way related to the death of Mushin. Additionally, some Sunnis reject that Muhsin existed due to the hadith referencing him being a weak hadith such as followers of Abu Bakr ibn al-â€˜Arabi. == References == Category:632 deaths Category:7th-century births",
