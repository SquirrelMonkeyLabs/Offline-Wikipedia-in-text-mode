 "text": "The Bahamas (officially called Commonwealth of The Bahamas) are a group of islands in the Caribbean Sea. The country's capital, Nassau, is on New Providence Island. The Taino were the first people living there. In 1492, Christopher Columbus found the Americas by landing on another of the islands, San Salvador. The Eleutheran Adventurers soon came along, making a home in Eleuthera. The islands' mostly black population speaks English, the country's main language. The Bahamas are a popular place for people to visit for holidays, the 700 islands and cays attract many visitors from nearby America, as well as Europe and other countries. == History == Lucayans were the first people to arrive in the Bahamas. They moved into the southern Bahamas from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century AD, having come there from South America. They came to be known as the Lucayan. About 30,000 Lucayan lived the Bahamas when Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. Columbus' first landfall in the New World was on an island named San Salvador, which some scholars believe to be present-day San Salvador Island. The Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to move to Hispaniola. They were used for forced labor. This and the exposure to foreign infectious disease led to most of the population of the Bahamas dying.Joanne E. Dumene, \"Looking for Columbus\", Five Hundred Magazine, April 1990, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 11â€“15 Smallpox alone wiped out half of the population in what is now the Bahamas.\"Schools Grapple With Columbus's Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?\", Education Week, 9 October 1991 In 1670, King Charles II rented out the islands to the Carolinas, along with rights of trading, tax, and governing the country. During this time, the Bahamas became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard. To restore proper government, Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718. The first governor was Woodes Rogers. After the American War of Independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists and their slaves in the Bahamas from New York, Florida, and the Carolinas. The first group of loyalists left St. Augustine in East Florida in September 1783. These Loyalists established plantations on several islands. British Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory. On 10 July 1973 The Bahamas gains full independence within British Commonwealth. == People == Nearly 500,000 people live in The Bahamas.
