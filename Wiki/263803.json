 "text": "Disulfur dinitride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is S2N2. It contains sulfur in its +3 oxidation state. It also contains nitride ions. ==Properties== Disulfur dinitride is a colorless crystalline solid. It is explosive, similar to tetrasulfur tetranitride. It easily evaporates. It does not dissolve in water. It turns back into tetrasulfur tetranitride when exposed to water. ==Preparation== Disulfur dinitride is produced by reacting elemental silver with tetrasulfur tetranitride. This forms silver(I) sulfide, which acts as a catalyst. This reaction happens in a vacuum. ==Uses== It reacts with some chemical compounds that are acids. ==Related pages== *Sulfur nitride *Sulfur hexafluoride Category:Sulfur compounds Category:Nitrogen compounds",
