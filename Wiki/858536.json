The flight had 139 passengers and 7 crew members, including 4 infants. While trying to land, Flight 605 went below the glideslope, a way to measure the rate a plane is going down while landing. The flight touched down on a golf club and bounced up and back down. The aircraft then went over a 12-ft wall, making the engines and landing gear come off. Then the plane flew over a road and crashed in a grassy area. ==References== Category:1990s in India Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Asia Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the 1990s",
