Skinner said that he earned the nickname for his behaviour in a tribute debate in the Commons following the death of former Conservative Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden in 1977: \"They were making speeches about the wonder of Anthony Eden, so I got up and talked about miners and people seriously injured and dead in the pits and the £200 given to the widow.

In 2020, Skinner was named Honorary President of the Socialist Campaign Group. ===Suspensions=== Skinner was suspended from parliament at least ten times for calling MPs inappropriate names.
