 "text": "Livyatan is an extinct genus of sperm whales. It only has one species under it: the Livyatan melvillei. It is named after the Leviathan, a monster from the bible, and after the author of the novel Moby Dick. The species was discovered by Belgian scientist Olivier Lambert. The Livyatan was the top of the food chain during its time. They were located at the coast of Peru about 12-13 million years ago (Miocene Epoch). Although it is between 13.5 and 18.5 metres in length (not larger than the sperm whale), their mouths are full of big teeth. The largest of these was 4 inches wide. Unlike sperm whales that eat squids most of the time, the Livyatan eat fellow whales like baleen whales. ==Discovery== In 1877, fossil hunters found teeth that is suspected to be larger than a sperm whale in Italy and Peru. They were amazed by how large it was and by observing the accompanying skull. In 2006, Belgian scientist Olivier Lambert set to find this skull beginning an expedition at the Pisco- Ica desert in Peru. The find was a loss. It is not a loss until in November 2008. They suspected that the skull they found came from a baleen whale but further observation from its teeth shows that it is big. They have found a skull that belongs to an extinct genus of whales, the Livyatan. ==References== Category:Whales",
