 "text": "The Beach Boys are an American pop/surf rock group from Hawthorne, California. They formed in 1961. The original members were brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Many of the band's early songs were about life in southern California, the beach, girls, cars, and surfing. David Marks replaced Jardine when he went away to school; after Jardine's return, Marks left the band. Bruce Johnston later became a regular band member, first replacing Brian Wilson on tour, then joining in on recording sessions. Reunions with some of the original band members still occur from time to time. ==Discography== Studio albums * Surfin' Safari (1962) * Surfin' U.S.A.
