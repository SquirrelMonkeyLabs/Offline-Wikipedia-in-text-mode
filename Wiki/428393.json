 "text": "The Division of Lyne is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It was set up in 1949, and named for Sir William Lyne, Premier of New South Wales at the time of Federation and a minister in early Australian governments. Lyne was asked by the first Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun to form the first Federal Government. Lyne did not have the support of other politicians, and so Edmund Barton became the first Prime Minister of Australia. The division is on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales. It includes Taree, Wauchope, Laurieton, Wingham, Gloucester and parts of Kempsey. ==Members== Member Party Term Jim Eggins Country 1949–1952 Philip Lucock Country 1952–1975 National Country 1975–1980 Bruce Cowan National Country 1980–1982 National 1982–1993 Mark Vaile National 1993–2008 Rob Oakeshott Independent 2008–2013 (resigned) David Gillespie National 2013–present Mark Vaile was the leader of the National Party, and Deputy Prime Minister.
