 "text": "The Mac Mini is a personal computer made by Apple Inc. It is small for a desktop computer, at 6.5 inches (16.5 cm) square and 2 inches (5.1 cm) tall. It was introduced on January 22, 2005. The newest model came out on November 2020. It weighs 2.9 pounds (1.31 kg). The Mac Mini's power supply is outside of the machine. It is about one third of the size of the computer itself. The Mac Mini is the first Macintosh desktop to not ship with a keyboard or mouse. Also, it does not come with a display. The Mac Mini is mainly intended for buyers who are \"switchers\" (users moving from PC/Windows to Mac) who already own a display, USB keyboard and a mouse. Others could easily buy these if needed. The newest model comes with Apple M1, 8 or 16 GB RAM, 256 GB, 1, 2 or 4 TB solid-state drive. It costs $699. ==References== Category:Apple hardware",
