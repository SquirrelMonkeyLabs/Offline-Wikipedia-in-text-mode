 "text": "James Harris (May 28, 1950 - August 9, 2020) was an American professional wrestler and author. For most of his career, Harris wrestled under the ring name Kamala, using a \"wild savage\" gimmick. He was born in Senatobia, Mississippi. On November 7, 2011, Harris had his left leg amputated below the knee due to complications of high blood pressure and diabetes, a condition he has had since 1992, but not accepting dialysis treatment, forcing him to retire on 2010. On November 19, 2017, Harris underwent \"life-saving\" emergency surgery at a hospital in Oxford, Mississippi. The cause for the surgery was not disclosed. Following the surgery, he was put on life support due to complications resulting from the surgery. On August 5, 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized in Oxford, Mississippi. He died four days later from cardiac arrest caused by diabetes and COVID-19, aged 70.https://twitter.com/CACReunion/status/1292608961338920960?s=19 ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1950 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Category:Deaths from diabetes Category:Deaths from cardiac arrest Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Sportspeople from Mississippi",
