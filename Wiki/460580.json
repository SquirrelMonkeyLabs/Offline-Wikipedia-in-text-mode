He also helped with the development of an artificial heart valve. He worked at St Vincent's Hospital with his team who had high success rates of heart transplants. Chang was born in Shanghai to Australian-born Chinese parents. He first grew up in Hong Kong before moving to Sydney, New South Wales, in 1951. He studied and trained at the University of Sydney as well as in the United Kingdom and the United States. He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1986. He was married to English-born Ann Simmons. The couple had three children. Chang was murdered on 4 July 1991 in Mosman, Sydney. He was 54. He was shot in the head twice for turning down the efforts of extortion by two men. The men, Malaysians Chew Seng \"Ah Sung\" Liew and Choon Tee \"Phillip\" Lim, first ran their vehicle into Chang's car, making him pull over. After arguing, Chang was shot dead by Liew. The men both later spent time in jail. ==References== ==Other websites== * Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute Category:1936 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Australian educators Category:Australian medical doctors Category:Murders by firearm Category:Order of Australia Category:Hong Kong people Category:People from Shanghai Category:People from Sydney",
