 "text": "Lunar time refers to the time on a clock on the moon. As of early 2025, there is no standard for lunar time. Instead, the time on the moon is different for each country involved. Thus, American activities on the moon run on a U.S. time zone, and Chinese activities on the moon run on China Standard Time. As more countries explore the moon and interact with each other, a new unified system will be needed. Another problem with using Earth's time zones is that time runs slightly faster on the moon than on Earth. This affects computers and other high-precision electronic systems. In 2024, the U.S. White House asked NASA to create a unified standard time for the Moon and for other celestial bodies by 2026. The European Space Agency has proposed a lunar reference time for the moon to solve this issue. ==References== Category:Time Category:Moon",
