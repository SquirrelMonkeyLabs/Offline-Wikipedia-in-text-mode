 "text": "The Free Energy Principle is a scientific concept that explains how living things interact with their environment. It says our brains try to avoid surprises and stay in control. Our brains make predictions about what will happen based on past experiences. When reality matches our predictions, everything is fine, but when something unexpected occurs, our brains need to update their predictions and take action to reduce the surprise. To do this, our brains gather information from our senses and compare it to their predictions. If there's a difference, the brain sends signals to our body to make adjustments. This helps us stay to adapt to new situations, learn from experiences, and optimize their interactions with the world. ==References== Category:Systems theory",
