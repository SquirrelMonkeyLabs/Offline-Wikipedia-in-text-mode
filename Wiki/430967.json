 "text": "The Reorganized National Government of China (), also known as the Wang Jingwei Regime () was a puppet government in China. It was led by Wang Jingwei, under the protection and support of the Empire of Japan. Only Japan and the other Axis powers recognized the Wang Jingwei regime as the legitimate government of China. The regime ended in 1945, at the end of World War II and the surrender of the Japanese army in China. The country was run by a dictator named Wang Jingwei, who used to be a high-ranking official in the Nationalist party called the Kuomintang (KMT). This area was taken over by Japan in the late 1930s when the Second Sino-Japanese War started.
