 "text": "\"Naprej, zastava slave\" (\"Forward, Flag of Glory\") was the national anthem of Slovenia from 1860 to 1941, when it was replaced by the national anthem of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1989, it was replaced by \"Zdravlijca\". In 1995, it became the anthem of the Slovenian Armed Forces. It was the first ever piece of Slovenian literature to be translated into English. ==Lyrics== Slovenian original English translation Naprej zastava slave, na boj junaška kri za blagor očetnjave 𝄆 naj puška govori! 𝄇 Z orožjem in desnico, nesimo vragu grom, zapisat v kri pravico, 𝄆 ki terja jo naš dom. 𝄇 Draga mati je prosila, roke okol vrata vila, je plakala moja mila, tu ostani ljubi moj! Zbogom mati, ljuba zdrava, mati mi je očetnjava, ljuba moja čast in slava, 𝄆 hajdmo, hajdmo, zanjo v boj! 𝄇 Z orožjem in desnico, nesimo vragu grom, zapisat v kri pravico, ki terja jo naš dom. Naprej! Naprej! Onward, banner of glory, to battle, heroic blood! for the sake of the motherland 𝄆 let the rifles sound! 𝄇 With weapons on our right, we bring the wrath of devil to write in blood the justice 𝄆 that our home demands. 𝄇 My dear mother cried, her arms wrapped around my neck, my darling was crying, stay here, my love! Farewell, mother dear and strong, my mother is my motherland, my love, honour and glory, 𝄆 let's go, let's go, fight for her! 𝄇 With weapons on our right, we bring the wrath of devil to write in blood the justice 𝄆 that our home demands. 𝄇 Onward! Onward! ==References== Category:Historical anthems Category:National symbols of Slovenia",
