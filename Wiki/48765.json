 "text": "The National League (or NL) is one of the two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB). As of 2024, the NL has 15 teams. At the end of each season, six of these teams go to the \"post-season\" where one will win the National League championship. The champions of the National League plays against the champions of the American League in the World Series. The team that wins the World Series is the champion of Major League Baseball. ==Differences== The only big difference between the National League and the American League (AL) was that the AL used the \"Designated Hitter\" (or DH). The Designated Hitter is a player who does not play in the field, but is used to bat for the pitcher. The NL did not use the Designated Hitter, and all players on the team must bat and field for themselves. This was changed following the new CBA signed in 2022. ==Related pages== *American League",
