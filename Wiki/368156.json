 "text": "The Coraciiformes are a group of usually colorful \"near passerine\" birds. They include the kingfishers, the Hoopoe, the bee-eaters, the rollers, and the hornbills. They generally have syndactyly, with three forward-pointing toes (and toes 3 & 4 fused at their base), though in many kingfishers one of these is missing. This is largely an Old World order, with the representation in the New World limited to the dozen or so species of todies and motmots, and a few of the more than 90 species of kingfishers.",
