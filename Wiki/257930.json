 "text": "Lithium carbonate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Li2CO3. It contains lithium and carbonate ions. ==Properties== Lithium carbonate is a white solid. It dissolves in water, although not as much as sodium carbonate. It reacts with acids to make carbon dioxide. It can react with carbon dioxide temporarily to make the bicarbonate. lithium carbonate is basic in nature. ==Preparation== It can be made by mixing lithium oxide or lithium hydroxide and carbon dioxide. == Production == Lithium is extracted from two main sources: pegmatite crystals and lithium compounds from brine pools. It is also found in the rare mineral zabuyelite. ==Uses== Lithium carbonate is used in various medications for treating bipolar disorder. It is also used in fireworks to make a bright red color. It is used in processing metal oxides. It can be used to make glass. It is used to glaze ceramics. It can also be used to dry cement. It is used in making lithium ion batteries. It is used in carbon dioxide detectors.Technical Information for Carbon Dioxide Sensors It is also used make the cathodes of most lithium-ion batteries, which are made from lithium cobalt oxide. ==Safety== Lithium carbonate is somewhat toxic. It is a base, and reacts with strong acids. ==References== ==Related pages== *Lithium nitride *Lithium nitrate Category:Lithium compounds Category:Carbonates",
