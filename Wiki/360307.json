 "text": "The Imaginatively Titled Punt & Dennis Show is a British stand-up and sketch show by comedians Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. There are two series: the first was shown in 1994; the second in 1995. Alistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona were among the regular guests on the show. It only ran for two series. The second was more simply titled Punt and Dennis. There were several character inventions in the sketches. Some of these were \"The Gullibles\", who were always falling for scams, as well as a number of Punt and Dennis's characters from The Mary Whitehouse Experience, such as the milk-obsessed \"Mr Strange\". There were also spoofs from TV programs such as Baywatch and The X-Files. The second series also had performances by tribute bands. They impersonated bands including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.
