SpongeBob is really excited, while Squidward is extremely annoyed. Squidward scares SpongeBob with tales of the hash-slinging slasher. According to Squidward, he was a fry cook at the Krusty Krab many years ago. When he was making Krabby Patties, he accidentally cut off his own hand, and later replaced it with a rusty spatula. He was run over by a bus and fired at his funeral. Every Tuesday night, his ghost comes to the place and haunts it. There are three signs of his arrival, which are: *1 - The lights will flicker on and off. *2 - The phone will ring, and there will be nobody there. *3 - He will arrive in the ghost of the bus which ran him over, and he crosses the road without looking both ways because he's already dead. Later that night, everything that Squidward says actually happens. He and SpongeBob are really scared until they find out that the so-called hash-slinging slasher is actually a person who wants a job application, and hung up on the phone because he was nervous. == References == Category:SpongeBob SquarePants episodes Category:2002 in American television Category:2002 television episodes",
