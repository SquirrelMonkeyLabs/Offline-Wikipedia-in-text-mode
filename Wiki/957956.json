Camilla was seen to be an unsuitable match for the future king. During Charles' marriage with Princess Diana, he remained a close friend with Camilla.

When their engagement was announced, it was also said that she would not be known as The Princess of Wales, although she legally held this title as the wife of The Prince of Wales. This decision was made due to the popularity of Prince Charles' first wife, Lady Diana Spencer, who held that title from 1981 until her divorce in 1996. Charles and Diana divorced the year prior to her death.The Duchess of Cornwall The Duchess took many visits, mostly in Great Britain — often with Prince Charles, but sometimes on her own.
