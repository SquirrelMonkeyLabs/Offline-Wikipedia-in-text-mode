Steam is sometimes thought of as a cloud of translucent mist, however that is only the result of the steam condensing in the air, forming water vapor. Actual hot steam is invisible. ==Introduction== When the pressure of the atmosphere is 1013 mbar – average pressure for a place which is at sea level – water will boil to become steam at 100 °C. This is the boiling point. Boiling happens in a boiler. 100 °C is the same temperature as 212 °F, 80 °R and 373.15 Kelvin. Steam is mainly used for powering up steam engines.
