 "text": "Thailand's Royal Barge Procession (; RTGS: krabuan phayuhayattra chonlamak) is a ceremony in Thailand. The ceremony is related to religion, and it is related to the monarchy. The ceremony has been known for about 700 years. During 70 years as king, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, ruled over the procession 16 times. These ceremonies now use 52 barges. The newest barge, the Royal Barge, the Narai Song Suban, was built in 1994; It is the only barge built during King Bhumibol's reign; 51 older barges are also part of the procession. These barges are manned by 2,082 oarsmen. The procession travels down the Chao Phraya River, from the Wasukri Royal Landing Place in Khet Dusit, Bangkok. It passes the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the Grand Palace, Wat Po and it arrives in the end, at Wat Arun, 'Temple of the Dawn'). Barges (in the procession) that have less importance than the Royal barge: The Tangmo ('watermelon') and the E. Leeung barges sail in front of the royal barges. They have the shape like the Police and Saeng barges, but are smaller and sit lower in the water. The oarsmen dress like the rowers on the Saengs. ==Sources== Category:Thai culture Category:Ceremonies",
