 "text": "Mophun is a computing platform used to run portable code on embedded and mobile devices. Some phones and other devices support Mophun. Sony Ericsson phones, especially the Sony Ericsson T300 and Sony Ericsson T610, are the best known devices for running Mophun. It was designed by Synergenix Interactive. Most Mophun programs are around 50–150 kB in size. Programs for Mophun are written in assembler in C and C++ using a well-documented and open API. A special version of GCC is used to compile programs.https://simonkagstrom.livejournal.com/8885.html Why Mophun failed: simonkagstrom — LiveJournal Despite the API being very easy for programmers to use, Mophun has not been very popular. The main reason for this seems to be the strict approval process - the compiled program can only be run under an emulator, and Synergenix must approve the program so it can be used on a mobile device. The approved program can only be run under one IMEI number. Only developers registered and approved by Synergix can use self-certification (and through the Synergenix server), and they are only allowed to have one IMEI number. The developer must sign a sales contract with Synergenix, which then shares and approves it for end-users, so the program can be shared. Such a process disallows free programs to be created for Mophun, and also discourages many developers from developing programs for Mophun. ==Supported platforms== * Sony Ericsson: T230,http://www.joescat.com/mobile/shiparcade.html Mophun Game - Ship Arcade - Joe's Cat Website T230, T237, T238, T290 (T290a, T290i, T290c), T300, T302, T306, T310, T312, T316, T610, T616, T618, T628, T630, T637, P800, P802, P900, P908, P910, Z600, Z608 * All phones running Symbian under the Series 60 (V1,https://old.computerra.ru/2003/516/203750/ Компьютерра: Истина не в последней инстанции, или Что будет с N-Gage V2 and V3http://mobile-indian.blogspot.com/2010/04/binpda-mophun-games-launcher-v101-s60v3.html MOBILE INDIA: BiNPDA Mophun Games Launcher v1.01 S60v3 SymbianOS9.1-BiNPDA) or UIQ 3.xhttps://www.mobilnisvet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&t;=11852&start;=220 MOBILNISVET • Pogledaj temu - Korisne aplikacije i igre za symbian UIQ3 user interfaces * All Windows Mobile Smartphones running at a resolution of 176x220 or 240x320http://onsmartphone1.blogspot.com/2007/09/mophun-emulator-and-games-pack.html Mophun Emulator and games pack | ON SMARTPHONE * Archos: Gmini 400, Gmini 402, PMA400, AV700 * Medion, PAVO, TTPCom: MD95674 * Voxtel: VS400 ==References== ==Other websites== * Mophun * Synergenix , the creator of Mophun * Website for developers Category:Mobile phones",
