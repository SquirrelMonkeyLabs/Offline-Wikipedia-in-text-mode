 "text": "A prime lens is a lens which has a fixed \"zoom\" or focal length. It is easier to make fixed focal lenses than to include them in a variable focus lens. Therefore, fixed focal lenses usually have a larger opening, known as an aperture, than comparable variable focus lenses. They are usually also of a higher optical quality. Category:Camera lenses",
