 "text": "The Flag of the State of Arizona has 13 rays of red and gold (the conquistador colors and of the flag of Spain) on the top half, representing the 13 first counties of Arizona (there are 15 counties today), as well as telling of Arizona's picturesque sunsets. There is a copper colored star in the center representing Arizona's copper-mining company. The rest of the flag is colored blue, representing liberty. In 1910, Colonel Charles W. Harris, head of the Arizona National Guard, made a flag for the Arizona Rifle Team when they attend the National Matches at Camp Perry. Arizona had been the only team in past matches to compete without a flag. Arizona Category:Arizona",
