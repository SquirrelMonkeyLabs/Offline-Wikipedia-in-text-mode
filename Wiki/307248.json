 "text": "A superacid is an acid with an acidity greater than that of 100% pure sulfuric acid.Non-simple definition: a superacid has a Hammett acidity function (H0) of −12. According to the modern definition, a superacid has a chemical potential of the proton higher than that of pure sulfuric acid. Chemists use strong acids to break down other molecules. Some molecules are so strong (held together with strong chemical bonds) that they resist attack by common acids. Superacids can break down molecules that stand up to most other acids. Commercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H), also known as triflic acid, and fluorosulfonic acid (FSO3H). Both superacids are about a thousand times stronger (that is, have more negative H0 values) than sulfuric acid. The strongest superacids are prepared by the combination of two components, a strong Lewis acid and a strong Brønsted acid. The strongest known superacid is fluoroantimonic acid. ==Related pages== *Superbase ==References== Category:Acids",
