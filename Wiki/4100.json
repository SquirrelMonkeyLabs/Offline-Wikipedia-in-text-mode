 "text": "Malta is a country in Southern Europe, and a member of the European Union. It is an island near the center of the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily. Although it is geologically located on the African Plate, Malta is recognized as a European country. The capital of Malta is Valletta. Around 500,000 people live in Malta and it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Malta is 316 sq km, which makes it one of the smallest countries and the smallest in the European Union. Its many cities and towns grew close to each other over time. == Language == Maltese is the national language of Malta. It is a Semitic language similar to the Maghrebi Dialects of North Africa, with a high amount of influence from Romance languages, in particular Italian, and more recently English. Maltese and English are the official languages in line with the constitution of the country. A majority of the people of Malta can speak three languages; Maltese, English and Italian. == Money == Malta had its own currency, called the Maltese Lira until 2008. The Maltese Lira was better known as the Maltese Pound because of the strong links to the United Kingdom. One Maltese Lira consisted of 100 cents. In 2008 Malta joined the Euro countries in adopting the Euro as the National Currency. == History == People have lived in Malta since at least 5200 BC. The island has some key archaeological sites dating from early times. Malta became well known as the base of the Knights Hospitaller. They moved to Malta after being forced to leave Palestine and then Rhodes, in Greece. In 1565 they survived a great attack by the Ottoman Empire. The history of the knights at Malta continued the strong Roman Catholic beliefs in the country that were started by the Norman and Spanish rulers. In 1798, Napoleon took control of Malta. The French rule was not popular and in 1800 Maltese rebels invited the British Royal Navy to come to the island. This led to 200 years as a British colony and independent Commonwealth member. During World War II, Malta was attacked this time by the Axis forces. The entire island was symbolically given the George Cross for heroism. Malta became independent in 1964 and a republic in 1974. In 2004 Malta joined the European Union and in 2008 Malta joined the Euro. ==Notes== == Other websites == * Maltese Relocation and Travel Guide * Malta travel guide and information * Malta Wiki - Malta Popular Encyclopedia * Malta holidays and hotels * Malta travel guide * Malta * Malta Travel Guide Category:Italian-speaking countries Category:European Union member states Category:Phoenician colonies Category:1974 establishments in Europe Category:Commonwealth member states Category:English-speaking countries",
