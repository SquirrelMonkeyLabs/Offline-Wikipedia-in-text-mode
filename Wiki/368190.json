Imanpa lies 160 km east of Uluru and 200 km south west of Alice Springs. There were 149 people living at Imaṉpa in the 2006 census. The town was first set up in 1978. The land was cut out from the property of the Mount Ebenezer cattle station, and served as a home for the station's stockmen and their families. The community is on the traditional country of southern Luritja and northern Yankunytjatjara people. These people are together called Matutjara (or Matuntara). Most of the people in the community are descended from this group. They speak a dialect that is a mix of the Yankunytjatjara and Luritja languages. Also living there are families belonging to the Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri and Arrernte nations, and a group of non-indigenous residents who work in the community. The area has two schools. The secondary school is part of Nyangatjatjara College based in Yulara. ==References== Category:Indigenous Australian communities Category:Towns in the Northern Territory Category:Pitjantjatjara Category:1978 establishments in Australia",
