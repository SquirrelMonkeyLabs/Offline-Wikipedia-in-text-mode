 "text": "The Popish Plot was a story made up by Titus Oates that caused people to hate the Catholics in England between 1678 and 1681. Oates said that there was a large Catholic conspiracy to kill Charles II. His story led to the execution of at least 15 men and caused the Exclusion Bill Crisis. After a while Oates' complicated story fell apart, and he was arrested and sent to prison for perjury. ==References== Category:17th century in England Category:1678 Category:1679 Category:1680 Category:1681 Category:1680s in Europe",
