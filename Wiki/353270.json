 "text": "1,112 and Counting is an essay that was written by novelist and playwright Larry Kramer in 1983. It was published in the New York Native. The newspaper is a gay daily newspaper for the LGBT community. It was believed to be one of the first major essays to be written about the AIDS crisis. The essay begins with the HIV death toll at the time. Many homosexuals did not like the essay. This was because the essay blamed them for the wide spread of the disease. Many others did not like it because Kramer was accused of being a 'self-hating gay man'. This was because of his novel Faggots which gave negative views on casual and anonymous sex. The essay helped influence much of queer writing. It also helped Kramer's reputation as a gay rights advocate. == References == * == Other websites == * The full text of \"1,112 and Counting\" Category:American essays Category:HIV/AIDS Category:1983 works",
