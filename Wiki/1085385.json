The genus name comes from the village of Hyner, Pennsylvania, which is near where the first specimen was found. Hyneria would've been as long as around 2 to 4 meters in length, and would've weighed around 2 tons. It swam in rivers. == References == == Other websites == *Hyneria at Devonian Times Category:Extinct fish Category:Lobe-finned fish Category:Devonian Category:Animals of North America Category:Animals of Africa",
