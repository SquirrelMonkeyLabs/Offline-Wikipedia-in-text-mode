It is unknown as to what his real name is, as he agreed to not reveal it on CBC. He sparked outrage after admitting on The New York Times that he murdered people while fighting for them. Numerous conservatives, such as Candice Bergen, called for action against him, as well as criticizing Justin Trudeau and the liberal government for refusing to arrest him. == References == Category:Islamic State people Category:Murderers Category:Canadian criminals Category:Pakistani criminals Category:Pakistani military people Category:Canadian military people Category:Living people",
