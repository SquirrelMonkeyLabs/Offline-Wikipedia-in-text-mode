 "text": "Hugo Armann (), was a German soldier, officer, teacher, and head teacher. He is known for saving the lives of more than 40 Jews during the Holocaust, which was during World War II, despite being a German Wehrmacht officer, by using his position as a Wehrmacht officer, and by hiding them and even giving them to Polish partisans, whom he secretly had connections with. Even though Armann had joined the Hitler Youth and became a member, in 1934, he left the program by the middle of July in 1935, and never became a member of the Nazi Party, which is obviously short for the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), just like his anti-Nazi parents. == Life == Armann was increasingly upset with the treatment of Jews during the Holocaust, and he had smuggled six (6) of those Jews out of the Baranavichy Ghetto, in German-occupied Belarus, after learning that the ghetto was expected to be liquidated soon. The rest of the Jews were smuggled out of seperate concentration camps or seperate ghettos throughout the western half of German-occupied Belarus. Armann managed to safely rescue and save those Jews, until the end of the Holocaust, despite the fact that at least ten (10) (and/or even more) seperate German officers were aware about the fact that he was rescuing and saving Jews, but fortunately and simply chose to not betray him. As a result for rescuing and saving the lives of all those Jews, Armann recieved and was awarded with the title \"Righteous Among The Nations\" on 5 September 1985. Armann had also planted a tree at Yad Vashem on the Avenue of the Righteous in September of 1986. After World War II ended in May of 1945, Armann had become a teacher, and later was a head teacher of a German school.
