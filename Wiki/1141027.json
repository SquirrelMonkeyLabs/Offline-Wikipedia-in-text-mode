 "text": "Ronn D. Torossian is an American public relations executive and the founder of 5W Public Relations (5WPR) in New York City. He is also an author. Torossian made his firm’s name with strong media tactics, which sometimes caused controversy. Torossian is very active in Israeli right-wing politics and activism. == Early life == Torossian was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in The Bronx. He went to Stuyvesant High School in New York City. When he was 13, his mother encouraged him to join Betar, a Zionist youth group linked to Israel’s Likud party. While studying at SUNY Albany, Torossian became the national president of Betar’s North American branch. After finishing his undergraduate degree, he moved to Israel to pursue a master’s degree but left his studies to get involved in political activism. Torossian, along with Betar members Danny Danon and Yoel Hasson, started an organization called Yerushalyim Shelanu (Our Jerusalem) to support Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. In 1999, Torossian criticized Benjamin Netanyahu for stopping construction at Har Homa and withdrawing Israeli troops from parts of Hebron. As the director of Americans for Israel’s Survival, Torossian helped organize a protest in 2002 outside the French tourist office in New York. The protest was against the French government’s lack of action on anti-Semitic attacks and called for a boycott of French goods and travel to France to hurt France’s economy. Torossian writes opinion pieces for the New York Post, The New York Observer, and The Jewish Press. In March 2015, he criticized the New Israel Fund along with Pamela Geller because of the NIF’s position on the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign. Torossian is a supporter of Donald Trump. == References == Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:People from Brooklyn Category:Writers from New York City",
