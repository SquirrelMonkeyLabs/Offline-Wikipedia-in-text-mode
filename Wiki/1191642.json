 "text": "The rosy bug-eyed frog or Chiloe Island ground frog (Eupsophus calcaratus) is a frog. It lives in Chile and Argentina.. ==Home== This frog lives in shady places near streams and swamps in Nothofagus forests where there is water in the air. Scientists saw this frog between 10 and 1300 meters above sea level. This frog lives in many protected parks. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in puddles on the ground. The tadpoles never eat. Scientists think the adult frogs take care of the tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives by cutting down too many trees to get wood to build with. Bad chemicals can also kill this frog. People sometimes use this frog as bait for fishing. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
