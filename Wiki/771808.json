 "text": "Dyfed (pronounced Durv-ed) is one of the eight preserved counties of Wales. It was created on 1 April 1974 when Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire came together. In 1996, it was abolished and Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire were made into seperate counties once again. The next day, Cardiganshire was renamed to its current name, Ceredigion. It was a very rural county and was located in the south-west of Wales. It had a border on the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel. It bordered Gwynedd to the north, Powys to the east and West Glamorgan to the south-east. The county's county town was Carmarthen but the largest town was Llanelli. The university town of Aberystwyth was also inside the county. The name Dyfed is still used today, for example in the name Dyfedâ€“Powys Police. Category:Preserved counties of Wales",
