 "text": "Oligodactyly is a limb deformity that starts at birth where a person has less than five fingers or toes on a hand or foot. It is usually caused by a heredital or genetic mutation. It can also be a sign or symptom of a few syndromes, including Poland syndrome and Weyer Ulnar Ray Syndrome. Often, people with oligodactyly are able to do daily tasks without difficulty. Even those with the worst forms of the condition can still do many things that need fine control, such as writing and boot-making as well as working as a taxi driver. Notably, many of the Vadoma people of Zimbabwe have oligodactyly. == Related pages == * Polydactyly â€“ the condition of having more than five fingers or toes == References == Category:Developmental disorders Category:Limbs and extremities",
