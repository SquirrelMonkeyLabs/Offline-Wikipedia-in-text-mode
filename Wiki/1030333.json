 "text": "Raven's Progressive Matrices is a test that measures a person's ability to solve problems and think logically. It was created by a man named John C. Raven. This test is different from others because it does not depend on language or cultural knowledge. It uses images and patterns, not words. The test is made up of many different pictures, arranged in a grid or \"matrix.\" Each picture has a pattern, but one piece of the pattern is missing. The person taking the test needs to find the missing piece from a list of options. The test gets harder as it goes on. It starts with simple pictures and patterns, and then becomes more complex. This is why it is called \"progressive\". The test can show if a person is good at seeing patterns and relationships between things. This test can be used with both children and adults. It is helpful because it does not require any reading or writing skills, so it can be used with people from many different backgrounds and education levels. == References == Category:Psychometrics",
