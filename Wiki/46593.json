 "text": "The Austrian People's Party (German: Österreichische Volkspartei, shortenend to ÖVP) is one of the biggest parties in Austria. It was founded in 1945. Its name roughly translates to Austrian People's party. It has about 630,000 members. Its views are often center-right. This means it often has conservative views on the matters at hand. Many of its voters are Catholics. It is against moderate socialism, which is embodied by the other big party, the SPÖ. Former Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel is a member of this party. Former Minister of the Interior Liese Prokop (died 2006) was also a member. == Leaders of the party == # Leopold Kunschak (1945-1945) # Leopold Figl (1945-1952) # Julius Raab (1952-1960) # Alfons Gorbach (1960-1963) # Josef Klaus (1963-1970) # Hermann Withalm (1970-1971) # Karl Schleinzer (1971-1975) # Josef Taus (1975-1979) # Alois Mock (1979-1989) # Josef Riegler (1989-1991) # Erhard Busek (1991-1995) # Wolfgang Schüssel (1995-2007) # Wilhelm Molterer (2007-2008) # Josef Pröll (2008-2011) # Michael Spindelegger (2011- 2014) # Reinhold Mitterlehner (2014 - 2017) # Sebastian Kurz (2017 -) Kurz has also been Chancellor of Austria since December 18, 2017. == Election results == === National Council === National Council of Austria Election year # of total votes % of overall vote # of seats Government 1945 1,602,227 (1st) 49.8% 85 (1st) ÖVP-SPÖ-KPÖ Majority 1949 1,846,581 (1st) 44.0% 77 (1st) ÖVP-SPÖ Majority 1953 1,781,777 (2nd) 41.3% 74 (1st) SPÖ-ÖVP Majority 1956 1,999,986 (1st) 46.0 82 (1st) ÖVP-SPÖ Majority 1959 1,928,043 (2nd) 44.2% 79 (1st) ÖVP- SPÖ Majority 1962 2,024,501 (1st) 45.4% 81 (1st) ÖVP-SPÖ Majority 1966 2,191,109 (1st) 48.3% 85 (1st) ÖVP Majority 1970 2,051,012 (2nd) 44.7% 78 (2nd) in opposition 1971 1,964,713 (2nd) 43.1% 80 (2nd) in opposition 1975 1,981,291 (2nd) 42.9% 80 (2nd) in opposition 1979 1,981,739 (2nd) 41.9% 77 (2nd) in opposition 1983 2,097,808 (2nd) 43.2% 81 (2nd) in opposition 1986 2,003,663 (2nd) 41.3% 77 (2nd) SPÖ-ÖVP Majority 1990 1,508,600 (2nd) 32.1% 60 (2nd) SPÖ-ÖVP Majority 1994 1,281,846 (2nd) 27.7% 52 (2nd) SPÖ-ÖVP Majority 1995 1,370,510 (2nd) 28.3% 52 (2nd) SPÖ-ÖVP Majority 1999 1,243,672 (3rd) 26.9% 52 (2nd) ÖVP-FPÖ Majority 2002 2,076,833 (1st) 42.3% 79 (1st) ÖVP-FPÖ Majority 2006 1,616,493 (2nd) 34.3% 66 (2nd) SPÖ-ÖVP Majority 2008 1,269,656 (2nd) 26.0% 51 (2nd) SPÖ-ÖVP Majority 2013 1,125,876 (2nd) 24.0% 47 (2nd) SPÖ- ÖVP Majority 2017 1,341,930 (1st) 31.4% 62 (1st) ÖVP-FPÖ Majority === European Parliament === European Parliament Election year # of total votes % of overall vote # of seats 1996 1,124,921 (1st) 29.7% 7 1999 859,175 (2nd) 30.7% 7 2004 817,716 (2nd) 32.7% 6 2009 858,921 (1st) 30.0% 6 2014 761,896 (1st) 27.0% 5 == References == Category:1945 establishments in Europe Category:1940s establishments in Austria Category:Christian democratic parties Category:Conservative parties Category:Political parties in Austria",
