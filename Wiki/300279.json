His songs usually use the racial slur nigger and sometimes he voices sympathy for Jim Crow-era segregation and the Ku Klux Klan. He went on hiatus for about three decades and then came back in 2001 after the September 11, 2001 attacks and issued his CD single \"Infidel Anthem\". ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== Year Album 1971 For Segregationists Only 2003 The Complete Johnny Rebel Collection 2003 It's the Attitude, Stupid! ===Singles=== Year Song 1966 Lookin' for a Handout/Kajun Klux Klan 1966 Nigger Hatin' Me/Who Likes a Nigger 1967 (Federal Aid Hell!)
