 "text": "A capital gains tax is a tax on the profit realized on the sale of a non- inventory asset. The most common capital gains are seen from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, and property. Not all countries have a capital gains tax and most have different rates of taxation. Countries that do not impose a capital gains tax include Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, Jamaica, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and others. In some countries, such as New Zealand and Singapore, professional traders and those who trade frequently are taxed on such profits as a business income. In the United Kingdom people paid Â£16.7 billion in capital gains tax in 2021-22. ==References== Category:Taxation",
