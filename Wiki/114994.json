 "text": "In statistical mechanics, Bose-Einstein statistics means the statistics of a system where you can not tell the difference between any of the particles, and the particles are bosons. Bosons are fundamental particles like the photon.Bosons have integer (whole number) spin and the Pauli exclusion principle is not true for them. The Bose-Einstein distribution tells you how many particles have a certain energy. The formula is : n(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\varepsilon-\\mu)/kT}-1} with \\varepsilon > \\mu and where: :n(ε) is the number of particles which have energy ε : ε is the energy :μ is the chemical potential :k is Boltzmann's constant :T is the temperature If \\varepsilon-\\mu \\gg kT , then the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics is a good approximation. == References == * == Notes == Category:Statistics Category:Physics Category:Quantum mechanics",
