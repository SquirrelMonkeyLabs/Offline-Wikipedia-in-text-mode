 "text": "Vine () was an American short-form video hosting service where users shared six-second-long, looping video clip's. It was founded in June 2012. Twitter bought it in October 2012, before its launch on January 24, 2013. Videos were published through Vine's social network, and could be shared on other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The Vine app could be used to browse videos, along with groups of videos by theme, and \"trending\" videos. Vine competed with other social-media services such as Instagram and Mobli. By December 2015, Vine had 200 million active users. On October 27, 2016, Twitter announced it would disable uploads, but viewing and download would continue to work. On January 20, 2017, Twitter launched an Internet archive of all Vine videos, allowing people to watch previously uploaded videos. The archive was discontinued in 2019. ==References== Category:Twitter Category:Video sharing websites Category:American websites",
