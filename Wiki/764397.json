 "text": "The Italic languages are a branch of the Indo-European language family. They were first spoken in Italy, and their main language was Latin, which eventually turned into the Romance languages that are spoken today. The Roman Empire spread Latin to much of Western Europe. Today, the main Italic languages spoken are Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian. There were other branches of Italic languages besides those that came from Latin, but all of them are now extinct. ==References== Category:Indo-European languages",
