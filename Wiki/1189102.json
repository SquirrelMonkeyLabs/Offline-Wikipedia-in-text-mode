 "text": "Sodium fluoroberyllate is a chemical compound made of sodium, beryllium, and fluorine. It has the chemical formula . It is a salt of the sodium cation and tetrafluoroberyllate anion. Sodium fluoroberyllate is the main intermediate used to separate beryllium metal from ores like beryl. == Production == Sodium fluoroberyllate is made from ores containing beryllium oxide by reaction with sodium fluorosilicate. A simplified version of the reaction is shown here: First, the sodium fluorosilicate splits into sodium fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride: : The silicon tetrafluoride then reacts with the beryllium oxide: : Beryllium fluoride reacts with fluoride anions to form a Lewis adduct, the tetrafluoroberyllate anion, which forms a salt with the sodium cations: : == Sources == Category:Sodium compounds Category:Beryllium compounds Category:Fluorine compounds",
