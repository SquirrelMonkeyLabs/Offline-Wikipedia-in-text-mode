 "text": "RTÉ One () is a television channel in Ireland. It is the main TV channel of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). It is the most popular channel in Ireland. It started in 31 December 1961 and was called Telefís Éireann. It was the first TV channel in Ireland. It was called RTÉ from 1966, and RTÉ 1 from 1978 when RTÉ 2 started. The channel was only in black and white between 1961 and 1968. From 1968, some programmes were broadcast in PAL colour. Some of the money for the channel comes from a government television licence, and the rest comes from advertisements. RTÉ channels have fewer advertisements than other channels because of this. RTÉ One can be watched by 98% of people in Ireland in HD on the Saorview digital service. It can also be watched on Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media, and online through RTÉ Player. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Television channels in Europe Category:20th-century establishments in the Republic of Ireland Category:1961 establishments in Europe",
