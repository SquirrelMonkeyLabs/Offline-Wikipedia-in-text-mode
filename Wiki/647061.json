 "text": "The 2016 Australian federal election was an election held on Saturday 2 July to elect all 226 members of the 45th Parliament of Australia. It lasted eight weeks. It was the first under a new voting system for the Senate that replaced group voting tickets with optional preferential voting. Incumbent Malcolm Turnbull was narrowly re-elected by forming a coalition government with other smaller parties. ==Opinion polls== ==Results== ===House of Representatives=== ===Senate=== ==Results aftermath== After a week of vote counting, no party had won enough seats in the House of Representatives to form a majority government. Neither the Liberal/National Coalition's incumbent Turnbull Government nor the Australian Labor Party's Shorten Opposition were in a position to claim victory. Turnbull talked with the crossbench. He won a confidence and supply support from Bob Katter, Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan in the event of a hung parliament and resulting minority government. On 10 July, Shorten conceded defeat. Turnbull claimed victory later that day. The election is the closest federal majority result since 1961, the ABC declared on 11 July that the Coalition could form a one-seat majority government. ==References== ==Other websites== *Australian Electoral Commission: 2016 federal election *ABC Elections: 2016 Federal Election Guide Category:July 2016 events Category:2010s in Australia Category:2016 elections Category:Elections in Australia Category:2016 in Oceania",
