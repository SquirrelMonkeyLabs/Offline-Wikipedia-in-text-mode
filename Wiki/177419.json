 "text": "The New Age, also called the New Age movement is a kind of spiritual belief and way of life held by some westerners. It is not an organized religion nor a new religious movement (NRM). They believe in religious pluralism - that people are free to decide what they believe and how they use it in their lives. They pick and mix what they believe with bits taken from both eastern and western culture and religions. They make their own decisions about what God is and how they worship God, if they even believe in God at all. New Age people often meditate, sometimes to seek their own contact with God. Many authors describe how they see the New Age in books. There is also New Age music which tends to be calm and relaxing. New Age people say a time is coming when people will be more aware of their own special spiritual nature and this will make the world a different and better place. This is sometimes called the Age of Aquarius, hence the name. Category:Spirituality",
