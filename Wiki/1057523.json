 "text": "The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization is an international nonviolent movement. The organization was started to speak for the unrepresented and marginalized peoples worldwide, such as indigenous peoples and minorities, and to protect their rights to self-determination. It was formally founded in February 1991 at the Peace Palace in The Hague by representatives of movements belonging to Australian Aboriginals, Armenians, Crimean Tatars, Cordillerans, East Turkestan, Estonians, Georgia, Greeks in Albania, Kurds, Latvians, Palauns, Tibetans, Taiwan, Tatarstan, and West Papuans. They were joined just a few months later by representatives from Abkhazia, Aceh, Assyria, the Chittagong Hill Tracts, South Moluccas, Bougainville, Chechnya, Kosovo, Zanzibar, and the Mari and Iraqi Turkmen people. ==References== ==Other websites== UNPO Official Website Category:Non- governmental organizations Category:International organizations",
