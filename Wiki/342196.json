The basis was taken in part from the United States Constitution. It was then changed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957. The present version is the text of 1994. The first government was made after the May Revolution. Many revolutionary leaders, led by Mariano Moreno, wanted to declare independence immediately. There were problems between the two main parties. Finally the federal constitution was made on May 1, 1853. ==Related pages== *Constitution *Constitutionalism *Constitutional economics ==References== * Official translation to English * from the Argentine Chamber of Deputies page. * Reforms to the original 1853 Constitution Category:Government of Argentina Argentina Category:1853 Argentina",
