 "text": "A storm surge is a sudden rise of water hitting areas close to the coast. Storm surges are usually created by a hurricane or other tropical cyclone. The surge happens because a storm has fast winds and low atmospheric pressure. Water is pushed on shore, and the water level rises. Strong storm surges can flood coastal towns and destroy homes. A storm surge is considered the deadliest part of a hurricane. They kill many people each year. == Related pages == * Tropical cyclone * Tsunami == References == == Other websites == *Data on Bangladesh disasters from NIRAPAD disaster response organisation. *NOAA National Hurricane Center storm surge page *\"The 1953 English East Coast Floods\" *DeltaWorks.Org North Sea Flood of 1953, includes images, video and animations.
