In the middle ages it was an independent city until it was conquered by the Florentines and then the Medicis. It has its own cathedral, and is built on top of an ancient volcanic hill. == History == The city was a Neolithic settlement and an important Etruscan center. It became a \"municipium\" (a type of Roman city) in the Roman Age. Volterra was attacked and controlled by Florence many times. When the Florentian Republic fell in 1530, Volterra came under the control of the Medici family. It later became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The original Etruscan city walls remain in parts, and the remains of the Roman baths, aqueduct and amphitheatre (arena). Visitors to Volterra have to leave their cars outside the town walls, in car parks. == Important monuments and places == * Roman theatre (1st century BC), discovered in the 1950s. * Piazza dei Priori * Palazzo dei Priori * Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta. * Medicean Fortress (Maschio) * Guarnacci Etruscan Museum The Medici Villa di Spedaletto is located outside the city in direction of Lajatico.
