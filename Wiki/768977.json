 "text": "Bloons is a video game series. It is made by Ninja Kiwi. ==Making== The first Bloons game was made by Stephen and Chris Harris, who are two brothers from New Zealand. Before working on Bloons, the brothers had released Cash Sprint, which was a racing game. After Cash Sprint proved to be successful, the brothers made their own website for flash games. However, the site wasn’t successful. The brothers decided to focus on making their own games, and made a website called Ninja Kiwi, which had five games when it opened. The site was a success, and this led to the brothers’ work on Bloons. The basic concept for Bloons came from Stephen's wife. When Stephen asked her what would be fun in a new game, she talked about carnival games with darts and balloons. The first version of Bloons was developed quickly, and the game was released in April 2007. It proved popular, and soon reached nearly 100,000 players per day. By 2011, Bloons had been played over 3 billion times. ==References== ==Other websites== * Ninja Kiwi official website Category:Browser games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video game series",
