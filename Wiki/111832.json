 "text": "Bull Hill, sometimes called Mount Taurus, is a mountain in the U.S. state of New York. It is north of the village of Cold Spring on the Hudson River, in Putnam County. It is part of the mountain range known as the Hudson Highlands which are part of the Appalachian Mountains. An old quarry can be seen on its south ridge. The mountain may have gotten its name from a bull that farmers chased down it. The bull's fall gave the Breakneck Ridge its name.
