 "text": "An upside-down cake is a cake that is baked in a single pan, then turned over and eaten with the bottom of the cake facing upwards. Usually, chopped fruits such as apples, pineapples or cherries and a topping of butter and sugar are placed on the bottom of the pan before the batter is poured in. When the cake is turned over, the fruit sits on the top of the cake. Traditional versions include the American pineapple upside-down cake, the French Tarte Tatin, and the Brazilian Bolo de banana. The first mention of such a cake in writing was in 1930, but the cake is somewhat older.John Mariani (1994) The Dictionary of American Food and Drink, revised edition. == Related pages == == References == Category:Cakes",
