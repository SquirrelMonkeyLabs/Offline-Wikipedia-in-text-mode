 "text": "Mavic is a company that makes parts for bicycles. It was started in France in the late 1800s by Charles Idoux and Lucien Chanel. The name \"Mavic\" is made from the first letters of their last names and the words for \"bicycle articles\" in French. Mavic made many things over the years, such as a group of parts that helped a bike win a big race. But now, Mavic mainly focuses on making wheels. In the past, Mavic was the first to make an aluminum wheel and a wheel with a disc. In 1973, Mavic also started offering help to all racing teams during bike races. This help was called \"neutral support\". Recently, Mavic was sold to a company called Regent, and then to a different company called Bourrelier Group. == References == Category:Cycling Category:Manufacturing companies of France",
