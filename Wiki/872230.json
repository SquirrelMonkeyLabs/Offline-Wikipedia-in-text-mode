Khabarovsk's nodal position at the point at which the Trans-Siberian Railway crosses the Amur River made it an important focus of the Russian Far East, and at one time it administered the entire area to the Bering Strait, which connects Russia and North America. Modern Khabarovsk spreads across a series of small valleys and ridges perpendicular to the Amur. Khabarovsk has an attractive waterfront park and long area and a mixture of modern apartment blocks, factories, and old, one-story wooden houses.
