 "text": "Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends is an animated fantasy children's cartoon that is shown on Cartoon Network in the U.S.A. It was created by Craig McCracken, who also made The Powerpuff Girls. It premiered on August 13, 2004. The cartoon ended on May 3, 2009. On July 18, 2022, Craig McCracken, the original creator of this show, said that there will be a Foster's Home and Powerpuff Girls spinoff == Background information == In the show's world, imaginary friends are as real as humans. Once the creator decides he or she does not want the imaginary friend anymore, they are sent to live at \"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends,\" an adoption home for the unwanted imaginary friends. In the ninety-minute debut episode, an blue friend named Blooregard Q. Kazoo (also known as Bloo for short) is allowed to live in the house without being available for adoption, as long as his creator Mac visits him every day at 3 o'clock. The show from this point onwards is about their many silly adventures with their new friends, both imaginary and human. == Main characters == The main characters are: * Mac (voiced by Sean Marquette) - A eight-year-old boy who created Bloo. He is the voice of reason most of the time. * Blooregard \"Bloo\" Q. Kazoo (voiced by Keith Ferguson) - A blue cylinder-like imaginary friend. Bloo is Mac’s creator's opposite, as he is wild and troublemaking. * Wilt (voiced by Phil LaMarr) - A very tall, disabled, red alien-like imaginary friend, with stalk-like eyes and a missing arm. He is gentle and will always help out the others (even if it comes to self-sacrifice). * Eduardo (voiced by Tom Kenny) - An purple, hairy bull-like imaginary friend who looks scary and intimidating—but is actually a coward with a big heart. He seems to have a Spanish accent, as he is Latin American. He doesn't like the dark and spiders. * Coco (voiced by Candi Milo) - An imaginary friend who is part bird, part airplane, part palm tree, and all crazy. All she can say is her own name. She consumes objects, then encases them in eggs. She is in love with the floor lamp, doesn't like when she gains weight. * Frances \"Frankie\" Foster (voiced by Grey Griffin) - A twenty-two- year-old human girl who is Madame Foster's granddaughter, working as the house's maid. She is very kind and friendly, but she has an angry side to her. She likes punk rock and silence, never nice to Bloo. * Mr. Herriman (voiced by Tom Kane) - A man-sized, grey and white, elderly, anthropomorphic British- accented lop-eared rabbit-like imaginary friend who is the president of the adoption home and Madame Foster's imaginary friend. His strict demeanor and many rules make him unpopular with the other residents of the adoption home (especially Bloo and Frankie). * Madame Foster (voiced by Candi Milo) - The old lady who first created the adoption home. She is mostly sweet and playful, but has a hidden malicious side to her. == Recurring characters == * Cheese (voiced by Candi Milo) - A pale yellow imaginary friend. He likes following Bloo around. == Production == Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends began production in the earlier 2000s (around 2002 and 2003) and came out in 2004. The series was created by Craig McCracken, a person who also created The Powerpuff Girls. A test pilot began tested in 2002, and was never released on Cartoon Network or Boomerang. The show was filmed in California in the earlier episodes. Bloo's name was originally going to Blob, but then Craig McCracken declined it, and decided to name him Bloo.
