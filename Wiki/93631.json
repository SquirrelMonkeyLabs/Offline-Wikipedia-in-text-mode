The part which went into the Saar became commonly known as Saarpfalz, and was administered by the two Bezirksamt: St. Ingbert and Homburg.

Since 1997 the district has a partnership with Henrico County, Virginia. == Coat of arms == The lion in the top left is the symbol of the Palatinate (Pfalz), the cross in the top right is the symbol of Trier, both owned big part of the district in the past.
