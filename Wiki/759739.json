 "text": "The Triple Crown in snooker is winning three tournaments, the World Championship, the UK Championship, and the Masters. These three events together make up the Triple Crown Series. Each individual tournament is called a Triple Crown event. Players who win all three tournaments are said to have \"won the Triple Crown\", either over their career, or in one season alone. The Triple Crown dates back to the 1969 World Snooker Championship, when the event changed reverted to a knockout format from the prior \"challenge\" basis. , 11 players have won all three events. Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan won each event five times or more. O'Sullivan has the most titles, having won 19 individual tournaments. Three players have won all three in the space of a season. Mark Williams, Steve Davis each won all three and Hendry having done so on two occasions. ==Tournament winners== ===By season=== A list of all winners of the three Triple Crown events is shown below by season: Season UK Championship The Masters World Championship Ref. 1968–69 started in 1977/1978 started in 1974/1975 (1/4) 1969–70 (1/7) 1970–71 (2/4) 1971–72 (1/5) 1972–73 (2/7) 1973–74 (3/7) 1974–75 (3/4) (4/7) 1975–76 (5/7) (6/7) 1976–77 (1/3) (4/4) 1977–78 (2/5) (7/7) 1978–79 (2/3) (1/3) 1979–80 (2/3) (1/4) 1980–81 (1/15) (3/5) (2/15) 1981–82 (3/15) (4/15) (4/5) 1982–83 (3/3) (2/4) (5/15) 1983–84 (5/5) (1/2) (6/15) 1984–85 (7/15) (3/4) (1/2) 1985–86 (8/15) (4/4) 1986–87 (9/15) (2/2) (10/15) 1987–88 (11/15) (12/15) (13/15) 1988–89 (3/3) (1/18) (14/15) 1989–90 (2/18) (3/18) (4/18) 1990–91 (5/18) (6/18) (1/2) 1991–92 (2/2) (7/18) (8/18) 1992–93 (2/2) (9/18) (10/18) 1993–94 (1/19) (11/18) 1994–95 (12/18) (2/19) (13/18) 1995–96 (14/18) (15/18) (16/18) 1996–97 (17/18) (15/15) 1997–98 (3/19) (1/7) (1/9) 1998–99 (2/9) (3/9) (18/18) 1999–2000 (2/7) (1/2) (3/7) 2000–01 (4/9) (1/3) (4/19) 2001–02 (5/19) (2/3) (1/2) 2002–03 (4/7) (5/7) (6/7) 2003–04 (2/2) (3/3) (6/19) 2004–05 (7/19) (1/3) 2005–06 (1/4) (5/9) 2006–07 (2/2) (8/19) (6/9) 2007–08 (9/19) (1/8) (10/19) 2008–09 (2/3) (11/19) (7/9) 2009–10 (2/4) (2/8) (1/4) 2010–11 (8/9) (3/4) (9/9) 2011–12 (1/3) (2/4) (12/19) 2012–13 (3/8) (4/8) (13/19) 2013–14 (3/4) (14/19) (5/8) 2014–15 (15/19) (3/3) (1/2) 2015–16 (4/4) (16/19) (6/8) 2016–17 (7/8) (17/19) (8/8) 2017–18 (18/19) (7/7) 2018–19 (19/19) (2/3) (3/3) 2019–20 (4/4) (2/2) Legend Legend Player won all three Triple Crown tournaments in the same season Player won two Triple Crown tournaments in the same season ===Multiple Triple Crown event winners=== Player Total World Championship UK Championship Masters Winning span 19 5 7 7 1993–2018 18 7 5 6 1989–1999 15 6 6 3 1980–1997 9 4 3 2 1998–2011 9 4 2 3 2008-2021 7 6 0 1 1970–1978 7 3 2 2 1998–2018 5 2 1 2 1972–1983 4 3 0 1 1969–1977 4 1 2 1 2010–2015 4 1 0 3 1980–1986 Ding Junhui 4 0 3 1 2005–2019 3 1 1 1 1979–1982 3 1 1 1 2005–2015 3 1 1 1 2011–2019 3 0 2 1 1977–1988 3 0 0 3 2001–2004 2 1 1 0 2002–2006 2 1 1 0 1991–1991 2 1 0 1 2015–2020 2 1 0 1 1985–1987 2 0 1 1 2000–2003 2 0 1 1 1984–1992 Legend Legend Player has won all Triple Crown events at least once The names of active players are marked in bold == References == Category:Pages containing links to subscription-only content Category:World Snooker Championship Category:UK Championship Category:Snooker tournaments",
