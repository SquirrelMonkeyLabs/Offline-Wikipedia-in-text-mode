It was directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler, starring Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther and Michael B. Jordan as the supervillain Erik Killmonger. == Plot == A long time ago, an asteroid made of a powerful metal called vibranium crashes in the African country of Wakanda. Vibranium can absorb vibrations and is the strongest metal on Earth. The tribes in Wakanda fight over the metal, but later unite under one leader called the Black Panther. Only the Jabari Tribe refuse to follow him and move to the mountains. With vibranium, Wakanda built advanced technology and powerful weapons. To stay safe, they hid their country from the rest of the world using a force field and cut off contact with outsiders. In 1992, King T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu in the United States. N'Jobu is secretly working with criminal and arms dealer, Ulysses Klaue, by stealing vibranium to help oppressed Black people overthrow the white man. T'Chaka gets this information from an insider, Zuri, who befriends N'Jobu. N'Jobu feels betrayed and attacks, but his brother kills him. N'Jobu's son, Erik Killmonger, finds his father's body and and promises to get revenge. Many years later, after T'Chaka is killed (in Captain America: Civil War), his son T'Challa becomes the new king. During his coronation, M'Baku, the leader of the Jabari, challenges him for the throne. T'Challa wins the fight but lets M'Baku live. Meanwhile, Killmonger teams up with the criminal Klaue to steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum and kills the staff. Klaue flees to South Korea to sell the artifact, but with the help of T'Challa, gets caught by CIA agent Everett Ros. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda is rich and powerful. Killmonger helps Klaue escape, but then kills him. He brings Klaue's body to Wakanda and demands the throne. Killmonger and T'Challa fight, with Killmonger winning and becoming king. He wants to use the Wakandan military to conquer all white people in the world and punish them for their crimes against Black people. T'Challa's family asks M'Baku for help. M'Baku shows them that T'Challa is still alive. His tribe saved him to repay his kindness for sparing his life. T'Challa recovers and challenges Killmonger again. They fight, and this time T'Challa wins. In the end, T'Challa chooses to share Wakanda's technology with the world. == Cast == * Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther * Michael B.
