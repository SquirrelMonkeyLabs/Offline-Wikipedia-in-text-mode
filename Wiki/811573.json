It is similar to the grammar of other Romance languages. == Verbs == Verbs in Spanish belong to one of three classes: -ar, -er, and -ir. Verbs are conjugated (changed) depending on tense and person. That means a verb talking about the past will have a different form than a verb about something happening right now. == Nouns == In Spanish, every noun has a gender, either masculine or feminine. == Adjectives == Adjectives usually go after the noun they describe and change depending on number and person.
