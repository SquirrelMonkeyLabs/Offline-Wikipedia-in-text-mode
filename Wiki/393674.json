 "text": "Palestinian political violence refers to violence or terrorism for which some Palestinians were responsible * * * with a view to achieving goals associated with the Israeli–Palestine conflict (1948 – ). Alleged goals of Palestinian political violence include the disestablishment of the current State of Israelde Waart, 1994, p. 223 . Referencing Article 9 of The Palestinian National Charter of 1968. The Avalon Project has a copy here and the recognition of an all-Palestinian state within what is considered the 1967 borders. * * * ==Overview== Palestinian groups engaging in political violence include but not limited to the Hamas, PLO, PFLP and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, most of which are designated as terrorist groups by several governments, particularly that of the United States (US), Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, New Zealand and the European Union (EU). ==Targets== Targets of Palestinian political violence include but not limited to Jews, Lebanese, Egyptians,Tuesday, October 26, 2004, Interior Ministry: defendants are eight Egyptians led by a Palestinian national living in Al-Arish Jordanians and Americans. ==Methods== Such violence often manifests itself as massacres by means of suicide bombings, mass shootings, plane hijackings and vehicle- ramming attacks, which were typical in the Second Intifada (September 28, 2000 – February 8, 2005). The worst atrocity committed by Palestinian terrorist groups so far is the October 7 massacre in 2023. * * * ==Statistics== Government statistics showed that at least 3,500 Israelis had been killed in Palestinian-related terrorist attacks since Israel's reestablishment in 1948. In 2022, 59% Palestinians believed that terrorist attacks on Israeli Jews were justified. ==Critique== The legitimacy of Palestinian political violence has long been a subject of contention due to an intersection of complex geopolitico-historical factors, widespread involvement of antisemitic rhetoric * * * * * * * * * * and transnational institutional implications. * * * * * * ==Selected list of suicide attacks== ===1989=== Name Date Location Dead Injured Notes Ref.
