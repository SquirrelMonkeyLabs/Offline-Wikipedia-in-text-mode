 "text": "The golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), also called the golden lion marmoset is a small, squirrel-sized monkey with a lion-like mane. Tamarins live in small family groups. They are diurnal (most active during the day); at night, they rest in the cavity of a tree. The life span is about 15 years. They are in danger of extinction due to loss of habitat as their forest home is being cleared. These tamarins are arboreal (they live in trees). They live in coastal tropical rainforests in eastern Brazil of South America. Lion Tamarins take their name from their impressive manesâ€”thick rings from Africa great cats lions. The golden lion tamarin may be the most beautiful of the four lion tamarin species. Its golden hair frames a charismatic black face and covers its small body and tail.Despite their name, these rare primates have far more in common with their monkey relatives than any feline. == Diet == The golden lion tamarin is an omnivore (eating both animals and plants); it eats insects, fruit, small snakes, lizards, snails, spiders, and vegetables. Tamarins use their claws to dig for insects in the bark of trees. Category:New World monkeys Category:Mammals of South America",
