 "text": "Funk metal is a subgenre of funk rock that fuses elements of heavy metal and funk. AllMusic has said that \"Funk metal evolved in the mid-'80s when alternative bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, Infectious Grooves, Mordred and Fishbone began playing the hybrid with a stronger funk underpinning than metal\". Faith No More have also been described as funk metal that dabbled in rap-metal. Rage Against the Machine's mix of funk and metal not only included rap, but also elements of punk rock. Primus, a band that has never had a clear genre, have been called things such as \"thrash metal-funk meets Don Knotts, Jr.\" Living Colour have been cited by Rolling Stone as \"Black-funk-metal pioneers.\" Certain bands not from an alternative background, such as Bang Tango and Extreme, have also put funk into their musical style many times. ==Notable funk metal artists== * 24-7 Spyz * Bang Tango * Bootsauce * Buckethead * Clutch * Electric Boys * Extreme * Fishbone * Faith No More * Family Force 5 * Follow for Now * Gargamel! * Hoobustank * I Mother Earth * Incubus * Infectious Grooves * Jimmie's Chicken Shack * Kid Rock (Early) * King's X * LAPD * Limp Bizkit * Living Colour * Lucy Brown * Maximum the Hormone * Mind Funk * Mr. Bungle (early) * Mordred * Nuclear Rabbit * Primus * Psychefunkapus * Rage Against the Machine * Red Hot Chili Peppers * Royal Crescent Mob * Siam Shade * Stevie Salas * Suicidal Tendencies * T.M.
