 "text": "Zoraptera is an order of insects, is one of the least diverse and most poorly understood insect lineages. Zoraptera are tiny, hemimetabolous insects superficially resembling barklice (Psocoptera) or termites (Isoptera). == Description == Individuals are generally less than 3 mm in total body length, exclusive of their antennae, and are gregarious. Overall, zorapterans are quite homogenous in their morphology and tend to be off-white (mostly nymphs) to brown in color. Individuals of each species occur in two morphs: eyed and winged forms that then shed their wings after dispersal or blind and apterous forms that predominate in colonies. == Other websites == category:Insects",
