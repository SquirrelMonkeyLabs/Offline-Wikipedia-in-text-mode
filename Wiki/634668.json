 "text": "Ernst Heinrich Weber (24 June 1795 â€“ 26 January 1878) was a German physician. He was one of the founders of experimental psychology. Weber was an influential and important figure in the areas of physiology and psychology during his lifetime and beyond. His studies on sensation and touch, and his emphasis on good experimental techniques were notable. They gave new direction and areas of study to future psychologists, physiologists, and anatomists. Weber was born into an academic background, with his father serving as a professor at the University of Wittenberg. Weber became a doctor, specializing in anatomy and physiology. Two of his younger brothers, Wilhelm and Eduard, were also influential in academia, both as scientists. One did physics and the other anatomy. Ernst became a lecturer and a professor at the University of Leipzig and stayed there until his retirement.
