 "text": "Aerobics or rhythmic fitness is a physical exercise performed under a rhythmic music. It includes running, jumping, stretching and strength training routines. It may be practiced in a group setting led by an instructor, although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer a wide variety of aerobic classes for participants to take. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class. Jogging and cycling similarly promote aerobic fitness, but they are not usually done in classes led by instructors or with music, hence are not \"aerobics\". ==Related pages== * Flexibility training Category:Fitness Category:Healthy lifestyle",
