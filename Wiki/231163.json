 "text": "Jersey Shore is an MTV reality series that features eight housemates who spend their summers in New Jersey and partying in their beach house and working at a store. Season 1 was shot in Seaside Heights, New Jersey and season 2 was shot in Miami, Florida. The cast later returned to Seaside Heights for Season 3 with a new cast member Deena. MTV has later reported that Season 4 of Jersey Shore will be filmed in Italy during spring and summer 2011. Also, cast members Snooki and JWoww have a spinoff show. The show has brought a lot of controversy about its use of the slang word \"guido/guidette\" and how they portray Italian American stereotypes. Despite this, the show has brought record high ratings for MTV, making it the network's most viewed reality show ever. MTV announced that they were going to cancel the series after 6 seasons. ==Cast members== * Angelina \"Jolie\" Pivarnick (Season 1–2), a New York City bartender * Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley (Season 1–6), graphic designer and club promoter from Franklin Square, New York * Michael \"The Situation\" Sorrentino (Season 1–6), assistant manager of a fitness center in Staten Island, New York * Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi (Season 1–6), aspiring veterinary technician from Marlboro, New York * Paul \"DJ Pauly D\" DelVecchio (Season 1–6), disc jockey from Johnston, Rhode Island * Ronnie Ortiz-Magro (Season 1–6), tries not to fall in love at the Jersey Shore * Sammi \"Sweetheart\" Giancola (Season 1–6), entered for the sole intent of having fun * Vinny Guadagnino (Season 1–6), entered to enjoy his first summer as a 21-year-old * Deena Nicole Cortese (Season 3–6), a friend of Polizzi's from New Egypt, New Jersey, who auditioned for Season 1 and was cast but had to leave before filming due to personal issues.
