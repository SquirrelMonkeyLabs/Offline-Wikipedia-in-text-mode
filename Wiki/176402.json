 "text": "The Salton Sea is a large inland lake in the United States state of California. There are no rivers which flow out of it (making it an endorheic lake), making it an extremely saline lake. It is approximately long from north to south, and wide from east to west. It is well below sea level, with its surface elevation at , and its deepest part is deep. The New River and Alamo River flow in from the south, while the Whitewater River flows in from the north. It was created in 1905, when heavy rain flooded the Colorado River and caused it to flow into the basin that now holds the Salton Sea. == References == Category:Lakes of California Category:Imperial County, California Category:Geography of Riverside County, California",
