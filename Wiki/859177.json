 "text": "\"Hot rod\" is a term used for a car that has been changed to be faster. This can be done by taking off parts to make it lighter or putting a more powerful motor in it. Hot rods are made by people who are passionate about cars. They use them often in races. They may also be painted or detailed. Traditional \"hot rods\" have declined. Cars have more parts than they used to. They also become less safe when parts are removed. For those reasons, racers are less likely to change their car to a hot rod.
