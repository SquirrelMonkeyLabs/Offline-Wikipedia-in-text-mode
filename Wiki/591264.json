 "text": "Français fondamental (French for fundamental French) is a simplified version of the French language with a goal to teach French to foreigners. Surveys conducted in the 1950s and 1960s show that a small number of words in standard French are used the same way in every situation. So, français fondamental uses fewer grammatical rules than standard French. Even though the idea was given up in the 1970s, Radio France internationale broadcasts the daily news in \"français facile\" (French for easy French). This is a similar idea to français fondamental. This news bulletin uses a vocabulary of about 300 words, and is broadcast every day at 20:00 Universal Time. == Related pages == *Basic English == Other websites == * Daily news bulletin of RFI, in Français facile Category:French language",
