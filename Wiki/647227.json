 "text": "The Dervish movement (Somali: Dhaqdhaqaaqii Daraawiishta) was a popular movement that developed in Khatumo between 1899 and 1920. It called for the expulsion of all foreign powers largely from the Khatumo region in the Horn of Africa. The Dervish monarch was Sultan Diiriye Guure,... whilst its emir was the Salihiyya Sufi Muslim poet Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, also known as Sayyid Mohamed. He called for the removal of British and Italian colonies in Somalia, the defeat of Ethiopian forces, the expulsion of Christianity and the establishment of a Muslim Somali state. ==History== On 3 March 1905 Hassan, the so-called \"Mad Mullah\" declared himself Sayyid of Nogal (Nugaal valley) in the Khatumo region. The territory coincided approximately with the actual Nugaal area in modern Khatumo State. It was ruled like a kind of sultanate on behalf of the Mahdi. Hassan's rule was ended by Italy in 1911. After the collapse of Hassanâ€™s resistance movement, rebellion and revolt occurred with disputes between different tribes in Northern Somalia. The Italian government of Somalia again worked together with the old tribesmen in order to try and keep peace between the several tribes, while maintaining close control over the military.Hess, Robert L. Italian Colonialism, p 146 Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (nicknamed the \"Mad Mullah\" by the British) escaped from the Khatumo region in 1920 to Imey Ethiopia, where he later died in 1921. == Legacy == The Dervish legacy mostly in Khatumo and to a lesser extent in Somalia has been influential. It was the \"most important revivalist Islamic movements\" in Somalia, state Hasan and Robleh.Hasan, Mohamed-Rashid S., and Salada M. Robleh 2004.

The movement, and particularly its leader, has been controversial in Somalia. Some cherish it as the founder of modern Somali nationalism. Others see it as an ambitious Muslim brotherhood militancy that destroyed Somalia's opportunity to move towards modernization and progress in favor of a puritanical Islamic state embedded with Islamic education. Its ideas are enshrined in the constitution of Somalia. ==Gallery== File:Taleh Castle.jpg| File:Eyl Castle.jpg| File:Dervish division.png| ==References== ==Notes== ==Related pages== * Somalia == Other websites == * Sultanates in northern Somalia * Mad Mullah Category:Darawiish Category:History of Somalia Category:1899 establishments Category:19th-century establishments in Africa Category:1921 disestablishments Category:20th-century disestablishments in Africa",
