 "text": "The Prime Minister of Luxembourg is the head of government in Luxembourg. His official residence and office is in the Hôtel de Bourgogne at 4 rue de la Congrégation in the city of Luxembourg. Before 1857, the Prime Minister was the President of the Council. In addition to these titles, the Prime Minister uses the title Minister of State. Since the foundation of the party system, only one cabinet (between 1921 and 1925) has not included members of more than one party. Most of the time, governments are grand coalitions of the two largest parties, no matter their ideology; this has made Luxembourg one of the most stable democracies in the world. Two cabinets (between 1945 and 1947) included members of every party represented in the Chamber of Deputies. ==List== ==Former living prime ministers== File:Jacques Santer cropped.jpg|Jacques Santer (1984–1995) File:Ioannes Claudius Juncker die 7 Martis 2014.jpg|Jean-Claude Juncker (1995–2013) File:Obisk predsednika vlade Luksemburga - 22. 2. 2023 (52704746470) (cropped).jpg|Xavier Bettel (2013–2023) ==References== ==Other websites== * Website of the Prime Minister of Luxembourg (in French) * Category:Government of Luxembourg",
