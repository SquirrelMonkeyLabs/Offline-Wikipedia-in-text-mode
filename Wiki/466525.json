Seoul hosted them in 1986 and Busan hosted them in 2002. The final medal count was led by China, followed by South Korea and Japan. Fourteen World records and 27 Asian records were broken during the Games. Japanese swimmer Kosuke Hagino was the most valuable player of the Games. Though there were several controversies, the Games were considered mainly successful. That was helped by the low cost and the rising standard of competition between the Asian countries. ==Sports== *Aquatics ** ** ** ** * * * *Baseball ** ** * * * * **Sprint **Slalom * * **BMX **Mountain bike **Road **Track * **Dressage **Eventing **Jumping * * * * * **Artistic **Rhythmic **Trampoline * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Tennis ** ** * *Volleyball ** ** * * * ==2014 Asian Para Games== The 2014 Asian Para Games is a disabled sport event held months after the Asian Games. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:2014 in Asia Category:2014 in sports Category:Asian Games by year Category:Incheon Category:2010s in South Korean sport",
