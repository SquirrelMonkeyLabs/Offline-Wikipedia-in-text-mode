 "text": "Human rights in Jordan are similar to or better than those elsewhere in the Middle East. Human Rights Watch reported in January 2018 that although recently there have been far-reaching reforms of the laws and regulations in the country, abuses against basic rights such as freedom of expression persisted. According to Freedom House, Jordan is ranked as the fifth-freest Arab country, but still regarded as \"not free\" in the 2021 report. It is also classified as having an authoritarian regime according to a 2020 democracy index. == Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights == Legal and societal discrimination and harassment remained a problem for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons in Jordan. Jordan is one of the few countries in the Middle East where homosexuality is legal, provided that it occurs in private, does not involve prostitution, and only involves consenting adults.Sexuality and Eroticism Among Males in Moslem Societies , Arno Schmitt and Jehoeda Sofer (eds), Harrington Park Press, Binghamton, 1992, , pp.137â€“138. However, sexual orientation and gender identity issues remain taboo within the traditional culture and the government does not recognize same-sex civil unions or marriages., 2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. State Department, 8 April 2011 Transgender Jordanians may be allowed to change their legal Sex, however Sex Reassignment surgery is required. ==References== Jordan Category:Politics of Jordan",
