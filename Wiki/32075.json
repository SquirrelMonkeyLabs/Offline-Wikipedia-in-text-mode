 "text": "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organisation of countries. Member countries of OECD all have a democratic system of government. They also accept the principle of a free economy. A country has a free economy when its government does not control the economic activities of its citizens and companies. The OECD started 1948 as the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). The Second World War had just ended three years before in 1945. Some countries of Europe came together to form OEEC to help each other re-build their industry and other things destroyed in the Second World War. Later on, some non-European countries also joined this organisation. In 1960, OEEC changed its name, and it became OECD: the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD's headquarters are at the Château de la Muette in Paris. ==Secretaries General== Secretary-General of the OECD No. Secretary-General Time served Country of origin Notes 1 Thorkil Kristensen 30 September 1961 – 30 September 1969 Denmark 2 Emiel van Lennep 1 October 1969 – 30 September 1984 Netherlands 3 Jean-Claude Paye 1 October 1984 – 30 September 1994 France — Staffan Sohlman (interim) 1 October 1994 – November 1994 Sweden 3 Jean- Claude Paye November 1994 – 31 May 1996 France ; Richard Woodward, The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2009, Routledge) 4 Donald Johnston 1 June 1996 – 31 May 2006 Canada 5 José Ángel Gurría 1 June 2006 – 31 May 2021 Mexico 6 Mathias Cormann 1 June 2021 – present Australia ==Members== OECD has thirty-eight member countries, of which 19 became members in 1961.
