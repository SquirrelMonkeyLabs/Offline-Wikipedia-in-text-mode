 "text": "Fryderyk Buchholtz (16 May 1792 Olsztynek (Hohenstein, Prussia) – 15 May 1837 Warsaw) was a Polish piano and organ maker. == Life == After he finished studying piano making in Vienna in 1815, Buchholtz came back to Warsaw and founded a piano factory at 1352 Mazowiecka street.Martha Novak Clinkscale. Makers of the Piano: 1820-1860. Oxford University Press, 1993. p.64 One of his pianos was owned by Chopin's family. The composer was also a frequent guest of Bucholtz's home art salon and a factory store.Vogel, “Fortepiany i idiofony klawiszowe w Królestwie Polskim w latach młodości Chopina,” 64. Buchholtz died in 1837, but his wife and later their son Julian continued with the business. Only a small number of pianos made by Buchholtz factory survived until XXI century. In 2017 there was made a replica of a Buchholtz piano, which was later used in the first International Chopin Competition on Period Instruments in 2018. == References == == Other websites == * The Fryderyk Chopin Institute.
