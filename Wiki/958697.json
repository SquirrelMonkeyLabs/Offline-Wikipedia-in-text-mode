It serves the town of Wick which it is 2 miles north of and much of the rest of Caithness. There are several connecting bus services from the airport. == History == Wick Airport opened in 1933 as a grass airfield operated by Highland Airways Ltd. but in 1939 the RAF took over the airfield due to World War II and upgraded it giving it a solid runway and more Hangars. == Destinations == Between 1976 and 2020 Loganair operated services to Edinburgh before they were discontinued because of the Pandemic. That same year Eastern Airways revoked their service to Aberdeen leave Wick Airport with no regular service. Eastern Airways and Loganair didn't reinstate their flights initially due to low demand but the Scottish Goverment offered Â£4 million to the Highland Council to bring back flights to Wick. In April 2022, Eastern Airways once again started flying to and from Aberdeen. == Passenger Volume == 2019 Rank Airport Passengers handled 2018-19 Change 1 Edinburgh Airport 7,395 21% 2 Aberdeen Airport 5,317 32% 2018 Rank Airport Passengers handled 2017-2018 change 1 Edinburgh Airport 9,341 16.2% 2 Aberdeen Airport 7,775 13.0% == References == Category:Airports in Scotland",
