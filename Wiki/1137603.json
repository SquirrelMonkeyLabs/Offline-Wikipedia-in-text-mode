 "text": "Bala Krishna (, Bālakṛṣṇa, lit. 'child Krishna/divine child Krishna') or Bala Gopala refers to the boyhood form of the Hindu deity Krishna. Worship of Bala Krishna is one of the earliest forms of devotion in Krishnaism and Vaishnavism. == Legend == Krishna was born as the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva, destined to defeat his tyrannical uncle Kamsa, the king of Mathura. Upon his birth in a prison, Krishna instructed his father to take him to Vraja, where he would be raised by his foster parents, Yashoda and Nanda, in the settlement of Gokulam. He spent his early childhood with his brother Balarama, growing up among the cowherds of Gokulam. == Childhood Tales == As a toddler, Bala Krishna is most recognized for his mischievous activities, particularly his fondness for stealing butter from the families of Gokulam. Butter, in devotional traditions, is often seen as a metaphor for love—abundant and non-quantifiable. His playful activities, or līlā, include untying cows, teasing children, and challenging social norms, all of which reflect his divine connection with the world. === Miraculous Feats === Bala Krishna’s divine nature is also demonstrated through miraculous feats. After learning of his birth, his uncle Kamsa sent various demons (asuras) to kill him. However, Krishna effortlessly defeated them: * Putana, a shapeshifting demoness, attempted to kill Krishna by offering him her poisoned breast, but Krishna sucked the life out of her. * Bakasura, a demon in the form of a crane, tried to swallow Krishna but was killed when Krishna split his beak. * Aghasura, a serpent demon, swallowed Krishna and his friends, but Krishna expanded in size, bursting Aghasura from within. == Symbolism and Worship == Bala Krishna symbolizes the divine playfulness of God and his intimate connection with the devotees. His childhood antics are seen not merely as pranks but as expressions of divine love and grace. Devotees believe that Krishna’s līlā brings them closer to experiencing God in a more personal and loving manner. In many homes and temples, Bala Krishna is worshipped in the form of a small idol, often depicted holding a ball of butter. The festival of Janmashtami, celebrating Krishna’s birth, is one of the most important holidays in his worship. == Related pages == * Krishna * Gopala Krishna * Yashoda * Krishnaism * Bhagavata Purana == References == == Other websites == * The Krishna Story: The Bala Krishna Episode * Krishna: Britannica Article Category:Hindu gods and goddesses",
