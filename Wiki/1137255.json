 "text": "A pager, also known as a beeper or bleeper, is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and shows alphanumeric or voice messages. There are several types of pagers. One-way pagers can only receive messages, while response pagers and two-way pagers can also accept messages, reply to, and track messages using an internal transmitter. Pagers were created in the 1950s and 1960s and became widely used by the 1980s through the late 1990s and early 2000s. Later in the 21st century, the use of cellphones and smartphones with text messaging hurt the pager industry. However, pagers are still used by people who work in emergency services and public safety. ==References== Category:Electronics",
