 "text": "Kate Elizabeth Forbes (born 6 April 1990) is a Scottish politician. She is the Deputy First Minister of Scotland and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic since May 2024. Forbes is a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP). She was Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy from 2020 to 2023. Forbes has been Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch since 2016. When Nicola Sturgeon resigned as Leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister of Scotland, Forbes announced her candidacy for leader in the 2023 SNP leadership election. While a popular candidate at first, she soon lost her popularity in the election for her anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage views. She lost the election to Humza Yousaf. When Yousaf's resigned in April 2024, Forbes was seen as a possible candidate to replace him in the 2024 SNP leadership election but she chose not to run and supported John Swinney. Swinney later appointed Forbes Deputy First Minister of Scotland and Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic in his government. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * Profile on SNP website Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish National Party members of the Scottish Parliament",
