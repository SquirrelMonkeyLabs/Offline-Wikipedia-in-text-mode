Reported cases remained low until small groups began to emerge in March; the largest group was linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering held in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in late February and early March, leading to massive spikes in local cases and an exportation of cases to neighbouring countries. Within a few weeks, Malaysia had recorded the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, passing over the 2,000 mark in active cases by the end of March from fewer than 30 at the start of the month. By 16 March, the virus is reported in every state and federal territory in the country. Measures to combat the outbreak were later announced by the Prime Minister of Malaysia Muhyiddin Yassin through a live nationwide telecast on 13 March 2020; by 16 March, a nationwide \"Movement Control Order\" (MCO) through social distancing, was announced to last between 18 and 31 March. As of 14 July 2021, the country reports a total of 867,567 confirmed cases, 101,359 active cases, 759,705 recoveries and 6,503 deaths. Well-known people diagnosed with Covid-19 include former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. ==References== Category:2020s in Malaysia Malaysia",
