 "text": "Neuroscience (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is the branch of biology which investigates every aspect of the brain and nervous system. The nervous system is made of billions of neurons connected together and to other systems in the body. The central nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord and retina. It is connected to the rest of the body via the peripheral nervous system. == Research themes == Neuroscience research focusses on a set of themes and questions.Research questions: * Behavior/cognition/language * Biological rhythms * Brain imaging or neuroimaging * Cell biology * Cell imaging & Electrophysiology * Learning/memory * Signal transduction * Neurobiology of the neuron * Neurotransmitter * Sensation and perception * Sleep * Autonomic nervous system and homeostasis * Arousal, attention and emotion * Genetics of the nervous system *Developmental biology of the nervous system *Diseases of the nervous system == Related pages == * Agonist * Biology * Cognitive neuropsychology * Ethology * Neurology * Neurolinguistic programming * Neuropsychology * Psychiatry ==References== === Textbooks === * * *Squire, L. et al.
