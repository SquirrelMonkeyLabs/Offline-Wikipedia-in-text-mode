 "text": "A Tegnér church () or Tegnér barn () is a popular nickname given to a type of church building. They are usually located in rural Sweden. They were often built during the late 18th century and the early 19th century. They were built when Esaias Tegnér was bishop of the Diocese of Växjö in the Church of Sweden. The term mostly became popular in Småland. These buildings are usually white. They are built in Neoclassicist style. They have a tall tower connected to the main building. Many of the buildings were built to replace demolished Medieval churches. The new churches were larger and could hold more people inside. This was needed because the population of Sweden was increasing. ==References==",
