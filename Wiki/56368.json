 "text": "In physics, a surface wave can refer to a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media, usually two fluids with different densities. A surface wave can also be an electromagnetic wave guided by a refractive index gradient. For radio waves, a ground wave is a surface wave that propagates close to the surface of the Earth. ==Related pages== === Waves === * Ocean surface waves, internal waves and crests, dispersion, and freak waves * List of wave topics === People === *Arnold Sommerfeld – published the mathematical treatise on the zenneck wave ==Other articles, further reading, and references== === Other websites === * Eric W.
