 "text": "U.S. Route 97 (US 97) is a United States highway in the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. The highway goes north and south through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. The highway is long. There was once a plan for US 97 to go north to Alaska. In the 1960s, the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities asked British Columbia and Yukon, both in Canada, to renumber their highways \"97\" to match the US numbering. British Columbia did renumber (British Columbia Highway 97), but Yukon did not. ==References== Category:U.S. Highways",
