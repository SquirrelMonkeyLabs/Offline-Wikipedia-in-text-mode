 "text": "A Bodel (plural Bodlim) is usually a young Israeli, often a student, engaged as a gofer by the Mossad after a thorough check and confirmation of his Jewish parentage and background. His job is to run errands and perform chores for the Mossad agents when required. He is prohibited from asking any questions and is only given any necessary information on a need to know basis. In return, he is allowed to live without paying any rent in a Mossad safehouse. The Bodel is not allowed to bring friends into the safehouse, and when visiting agents move in, he has to move out. However, he can be retained to do the shopping, cleaning and laundry. == Related pages == *Katsa (Mossad) *Sayanim ==Citations== ==References== * . Category:Mossad",
