 "text": "The splashback poison frog, splash-backed poison frog, or splashed-back poison arrow frog (Adelphobates galactonotus) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Body== The frog has bright color on its skin. It comes in two different color patterns, but all the frogs have the same poison. Scientists think the colors help the frogs see each other when it is time to make young. ==Home== Scientists see this frog on the ground in tropical rainforests. This frog lives in places where Brazil nut trees grow. Scientists have seen it as high as 600 meters above sea level. Scientists say the frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==Young== After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. Scientists think they bring the tadpoles to the shells of Brazil nuts. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. But people cut down the forests where it lives to make farms, to dig good rocks out of the ground, and make dams for electricity. Fires can also stop the forests where the frog lives. People have caught these frogs to sell as pets. There are many frogs living as pets in the United States, Europe, and Japan. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
