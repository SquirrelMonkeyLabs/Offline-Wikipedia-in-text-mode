 "text": "The women's rights movement is a feminist movement, where women act to get what men have but what women have been denied. The women's rights movement has fought for things such as letting women vote, giving women access to jobs (such as doing construction work) that only men were allowed to do before, and even the right to same-sex marriage. Women and men can both stand for this movement. Women's rights leaders such as Susan B. Anthony encouraged many women to join the women's rights movements. In different societies throughout history, women have had different amounts of rights. The movement fighting for women's rights to vote is called women's suffrage. While there has been a ton of progress, many countries still do not allow women to vote, among other basic rights. == Related pages == *Gender equality *UN Women *Human rights *International Women's Day *Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women *Olympe de Gouges *Universal suffrage *Violence against women Category:Feminism Category:Activism",
