 "text": "An inflatable boat is a kind of boat which is made from rubber. It is filled with air. In some boats is possible to install outboard motor. Inflatable boats are usually made to fit into small places so they can be moved easily. Some inflatable boats are rigid. They have a hard floor, and the tubes of the walls are strong so they can be inflated to high pressure and become stiff. Vulcanization of rubber became commonplace in the 1840s and was used for inflatable objects including boats. British explorers in the Arctic used Peter Halkett's boats. Since then, they have been used for many purposes. == Notes == Category:Boats",
