 "text": "Pace v. Alabama was a unanimous 1883 United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruling that said that Alabama's law that forbade people of different races from having sex with each other did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because both/all of the people involved in each act of interracial sex were punished equally. Pace v. Alabama was overturned over 80 years later by McLaughlin v. Florida and Loving v. Virginia. In 2010, M. Kelly Tillery said that Pace v. Alabama was one of the ten top worst SCOTUS decisions of all time.https://www.philadelphiabar.org/WebObjects/PBAReadOnly.woa/Contents/WebServerResources/CMSResources/TPL_summer2010_worst.pdf ==References== Category:1883 in the United States Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States law",
