 "text": "Suicidal ideation is the medical terminology for thoughts of or preoccupation with killing yourself. It varies between fleeting thoughts and self-harm or making suicidal attempts. Most people who undergo suicidal ideation never really kill themselves, though some do. This condition is often triggered through being hopeless, depressed, anxiety, having panic attacks or strong remorse. It can also happen because of being abused, as a result of certain medications, due to bullying or feeling rejected. Category:Mental illnesses Category:Suicide",
