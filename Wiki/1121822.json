 "text": "Kodachrome is a discontinued color slide film. This means that it produces a positive, true-color image on the film rather than a negative like the common C-41 film. It was made by Kodak from 1935 to 2009. It had a complex developing process called K-14. It had to be developed in a lab dedicated to this process. The last lab developing Kodachrome in color closed in 2010, although there are still several labs that can develop it in black and white. == See also == Ektachrome is a similar film that also produces a positive image, but has a much simpler development process.
