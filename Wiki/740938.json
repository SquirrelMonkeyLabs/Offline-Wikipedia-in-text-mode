 "text": "Ergative-absolutive languages, sometimes called ergative languages, are languages where the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb behave the same way in a sentence. Both behave differently to the subject of a transitive verb. In English and other nominative languages, the agent (\"doer\", she in She walked the dog) of a transitive verb and the subject (\"doer\", she in She walked) of an intransitive verb are both in the nominative case, and the object (\"done-to\", dog in She walked the dog) is in the accusative case. In an ergative language, the agent of a transitive verb is in the ergative case, while the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are in the absolutive case. Some examples of ergative-absolutive languages include Basque, Georgian, Mayan, Tibetan, Tagalog and the Kurdish language. If one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative–accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English: Accusative English: :He (A) found me (O). :He (S) traveled. (S form = A form) Hypothetical ergative English: :He (A) found me (O). :Him (S) traveled. (S form = O form) Category:Linguistics",
