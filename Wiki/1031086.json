 "text": "The Fiat 500 is an Italian car produced by Italian car manufacturer Fiat over four generations. ==1st generation== The original Fiat 500 was introduced in 1936. It was one of the first very small, yet real cars. It became widely known as the Fiat Topolino (Topolino is Italian for 'little mouse' and Mickey Mouse). After the Second World War, in 1947 it received a stronger engine and two years later a facelift. There was also a stationcar, the Giardiniera, later named Belvedere. Production ended in 1955. The Topolino was also produced in France as Simca 5 and 6, and in Germany as NSU-Fiat 500. ==2nd generation== The second generation 500 was produced from 1957 to 1975. It is about 2.9 metres long, has the engine in the rear with rear wheel drive, and was offered in two body styles: a 2-door saloon and a 3-door stationcar, called Giardiniera. Apart from Italy, it was also manufactured in Austria by Steyr-Puch and in Germany by NSU-Fiat. Abarth produced high-performance versions. ==3rd generation== Revealed in 2007, the third generation 500 came in convertible and hatchback body styles. It grew about 0.6 metres longer, now 3.5m long. It was only front wheel drive. It could also be had as high- performance Abarth. In the USA, an electric version was available. Production took place in Poland and ended in 2020.
