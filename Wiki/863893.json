 "text": "On 15 August 2021, the Taliban took over the city of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. This means that they won the war against the Afghan government. This happened because of a a military offensive that began in May 2021, which was the latest stage of their insurgency against the Afghan government. The capture took place hours after President Ashraf Ghani escaped from the country. U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to remove troops from Afghanistan, followed by his replacement Joe Biden continuing to do so, made it easier for the Taliban to take power. In the days before and after Kabul's fall, thousands of civilians left the country and thousands of others have failed in their attempts to do so. Many Afghan women are scared because they don't know how the Taliban will treat women in Afghanistan. On 30 August 2021, evacuations from Afghanistan ended, allowing Taliban to take full control of the country and ending the War in Afghanistan.Afghanistan Live Updates: The United States Occupation Is Over ==References== Category:2021 in Kabul Category:August 2021 events Category:Taliban",
