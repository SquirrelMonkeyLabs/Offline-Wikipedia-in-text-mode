 "text": "The Waikato River is the longest river in New Zealand. It flows for 425 kilometers through the North Island. It starts on Mount Ruapehu, joins the Tongariro River system, and passes through Lake Taupo. After draining Taupo, it forms the Huka Falls and flows northwest across the Waikato Plains. The river ends at the Tasman Sea south of Auckland, known as Port Waikato. The Waikato region surrounds the Waikato Plains. The Waikato river's current course was shaped about 17,000 years ago due to factors like climate changes and forest regrowth. Its main tributary is the Waipa River which joins it at Ngaruawahia. == Name == The name Waikato means flowing water in Maori. For local Maori tribes, especially the Tainui, the Waikato River holds spiritual significance and is a source of pride (mana). The Turangawaewae marae (sacred place), which is highly respected, is located near the riverbanks in Ngaruawahia. == Related pages == * Climate of New Zealand * Polynesian people == References == Category:Rivers of New Zealand",
