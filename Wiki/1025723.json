 "text": "Enzyme kinetics is a field of chemistry. It describes how fast reactions happen, that involve enzymes. Enzyme kinetics is widely used in biology and chemistry. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured, and the effects of different other factors of the environment are taken into account. Studying an enzyme this way can help people explain its role in the metabolism of animals and humans. It can also show how a certain substance or drug can affect this rate. Category:Chemistry",
