 "text": "Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a type of rock music. It came from post-punk in the late 1970s. The first gothic rock bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. Gothic rock sounds different from post-punk. It uses mostly minor chords and chords played on the bass guitar. It has sad lyrics that take inspiration from gothic fiction books. The lyrics sometimes talk about subjects like death and monsters. Gothic rock created a community that had its own nightclubs (places to dance and drink alcohol) and clothing style. This community is called the goth subculture. ==References== Category:Rock music Category:1980s in music Category:1990s in music",
