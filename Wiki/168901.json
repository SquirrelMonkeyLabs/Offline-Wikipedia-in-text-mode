 "text": "Corruption is a system that starts out good but somehow goes wrong. The word comes from a Latin word meaning \"Rotting\". Corruption could be a government doing what they say is good, but instead oppress people, or an official doing something wrong. A text that is miscopied, or computer file or computer program which malfunctions or becomes infected with a computer virus, may be called \"corrupt\". It may also mean an abuse of power, usually for a personal benefit. Sometimes the term just means bribery. ==Related pages== *Corruption Perceptions Index *Electoral fraud *Injustice *Monopoly *Plutocracy *Political corruption *Tax evasion - Panama Papers ==References==",
