He served as a member of the Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina on commission from February 27, 2025, until April 7, 2025, when he resigned. ==Biography== ===Family and Early Life=== Manuel José García- Mansilla de Uriburu was born on May 6, 1970, in San Carlos de Bariloche, Río Negro Province, where his parents lived. He was baptized on June 20 of that year in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Nahuel Huapi with the names Manuel José. His godparents were his uncles Camilo Vicente Uriburu Montes and Ana María Eduarda García-Mansilla, and the sacrament was administered by Father Pedro Pasino. He is the son of Manuel Rafael García-Mansilla de Zavalía and María Inés de Uriburu Montes. Through his father, he is descended from Manuel José García, the first Minister of Finance of the Argentine Republic, and Lucio Norberto Mansilla, the first governor of Entre Ríos. Through his mother, he is the grandson of the former Interim Governor of the Province of Córdoba, José Camilo Uriburu, and an indirect relative of Presidents José Evaristo Uriburu and José Félix Uriburu. García-Mansilla married María Dolores Franco Laplace, who, like him, is a lawyer with a degree from the Catholic University of Argentina and a Master's degree in Law from Georgetown University. ===Education and Public Service=== He holds a PhD in Law from the Universidad del Salvador. He earned a Master's degree in Law from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in the United States. He began his career in the legal profession at the law firm Uriburu-Bosch & Asociados. In 1997, he began working at the law firm Marval, O'Farrell y Mairal. He provided legal advice to oil companies between 2005 and 2010. In 2014, he became executive director of the Chamber of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production. For six years, he served as dean of the Faculty of Law at the Universidad Austral. During his tenure, the school achieved first place among private universities. He resigned as dean in December 2024, at the end of his second term. ==Supreme Court nomination== In March 2024, President Javier Milei announced the nomination of García-Mansilla to serve on the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, replacing Juan Carlos Maqueda. The appointment was made official on May 27, 2024, when the President sent his nomination to the Senate requesting approval, as established by Article 99, paragraph 4 of the National Constitution. In August, García-Mansilla declared before the Agreements Commission that he would not accept a commission appointment, even though the National Constitution allows for it. On February 25, 2025, President Milei appointed him on commission by decree No. 137/2025, in accordance with article 99, paragraph 19 of the National Constitution for \"the jobs that require the agreement of the Senate, and that occur during its recess.\" The Supreme Court, considering that the candidate García-Mansilla met the conditions of suitability required in the National Constitution, swore him in two days later. Finally, on April 3, the Senate of the Nation rejected his list with 51 negative votes against 20 affirmative votes. Following the vote, Judge Alejo Ramos Padilla, in charge of the Federal Court of First Instance for Civil, Commercial, and Administrative Litigation No. 2 of La Plata, issued a precautionary measure ordering García-Mansilla to refrain from making decisions as a member of the Supreme Court until the substantive issue is resolved. This measure was adopted in the context of a case challenging the constitutionality of Decree 137/2025 that appointed García-Mansilla as a commissioner. Following the Senate's rejection and pressure to resign, after holding the position for 39 days, García-Mansilla resigned as a Supreme Court justice on Monday, April 7, in a letter sent to the president. == Personal life == Mansilla was born on 6 May 1970, in San Carlos de Bariloche. He is 53 years old, married, and has three children. In 2018, he spoke out against legal abortion. == References == Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine lawyers Category:Argentine judges",
