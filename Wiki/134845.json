 "text": "The Flag of Alaska has eight gold stars on dark blue. These stars form the Big Dipper and the North Star. == Creation == The flag was created in 1927 by Benny Benson, a 13-year-old Alaska native. Up to that time, Alaskans had flown only the U.S. flag. Benson's design was chosen over 700 other submissions from school-children in grades 7â€“12. Most other entries showed the seal, the midnight sun, the northern lights, polar bears, and gold pans. To celebrate his achievement, Benson was awarded $1,000 and an engraved watch. The Alaska Legislature adopted the flag on May 2, 1927. It was kept as the state flag upon statehood in 1959. == Alaska's Flag Song Lyrics == This song was made for the flag. ==Related pages== *Alaska ==Other websites== *Catalog of the \"Eight Stars\" exhibit at the Alaska State Museum, in PDF format; requires Adobe Reader Alaska Category:Alaska",
