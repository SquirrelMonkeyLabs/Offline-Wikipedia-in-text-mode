 "text": "The blue peafowl or Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is a bird native to the Indian subcontinent.Avibase - the world bird database There is a noticeable sexual dimorphism in the Indian peafowl. Best renowned for their lengthy train, the vividly colored male features a blue head with a fan-shaped crest. Long upper-tail covert feathers with colorful eyespots make up the train. During courtship, these rigid feathers are lifted into a fan and trembled in a show. The peahen lacks the ornate train and is primarily brown in color, with a white face and an iridescent green lower neck. The leucistic white peafowl is one of the several color variations of the Indian peafowl. ==References== Category:Birds of India Category:Birds of Pakistan Category:Phasianidae",
