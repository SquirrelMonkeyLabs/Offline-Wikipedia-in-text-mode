 "text": "The Women's World Championship wrestling championship in WWE competed by women of the Raw brand. It was created after the return of the brand extension. First known as the SmackDown Women's Championship, it was revealed on the August 23, 2016, episode of SmackDown as the counterpart to the WWE Women's Championship, which became exclusive to Raw as a result of the 2016 WWE Draft. The first champion was Becky Lynch. As a result of the 2023 WWE Draft, the Raw and SmackDown women's championships switched brands, with the SmackDown Women's Championship renamed as the Women's World Championship, while the Raw Women's Championship changed to its original name of WWE Women's Championship. The title has been in the main event of three WWE premium live events: at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in 2018, together with the Raw Women's Championship at the time, at WWE's flagship event WrestleMania 35 in 2019, and by itself on Night 1 of WrestleMania 37 in 2021. It was also the first women's wrestling championship to be defended in Saudi Arabia, at Super ShowDown in 2020. == History == With the return of the WWE Brand Extension in the middle of 2016, a draft took place on July 19. The WWE Women's Champion Charlotte was drafted to Raw. As a result, SmackDown Live was left without a women's title. On the August 23, 2016 episode of SmackDown Live, Shane McMahon introduced the SmackDown Women's Championship. The first champion was crowned at Backlash on September 11, 2016, where Becky Lynch beat Alexa Bliss, Carmella, Naomi, Natalya and Nikki Bella in a six-pack elimination challenge to win the title. Following the 2023 WWE Draft, the Raw and SmackDown Women's Championships switched brands and there were no title changes for either championship before drafted wrestlers went to their brands on May 8. The problem was solved on the June 12, 2023, episode of Raw. WWE official Adam Pearce gave a new championship belt to reigning champion Rhea Ripley, with the title renamed as the Women's World Championship. This came shortly after the Raw Women's Championship became the WWE Women's Championship again on June 9. On the April 15, 2024 episode of Raw, the title was vacated for the first time, after Ripley injured her right arm. This ties Ripley and Bayley for the longest single reign at 380 days. The following week on Raw, Becky Lynch won a Battle royal to win her fifth Women's World Championship. === Match to crown first champion === Eliminated Wrestler Eliminated by Method of elimination Times Alexa Bliss Naomi Pinfall 9:38 Naomi Natalya Submission 10:52 Natalya Nikki Bella Pinfall 12:50 Nikki Bella Carmella 12:58 Carmella Becky Lynch Submission 14:40 Becky Lynch ==Title history== As of , , there have been 27 reigns between 12 champions.
