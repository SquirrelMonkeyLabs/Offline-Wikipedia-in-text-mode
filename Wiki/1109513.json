 "text": "The Chiravasi Indian frog or Amboli leaping frog (Indirana chiravasi) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. ==Appearance== The skin of the frog's back has folds in it but no warts. The skin of the belly is smooth with no color pattern on it. The undersides of the front and back feet are dark brown in color. ==Home== This frog lives in forests and on rocks. People find them in cracks in big rocks, on red rocks, on moss on rocks, and on dead leaves on the ground. Sometimes people see them in paddy fields. People have seen this frog between 26 and 998 meters above sea level. ==Young== This frog's tadpoles do not live in the water and instead move across wet rocks and moss using their tails and their back legs. Their back legs grow on them sooner than other tadpoles' back legs. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it is in some danger. People change the places where it lives to build roads, dig good rocks out of the ground and grow nut trees. In some places, it is against the law to take trees out of the forest, but people do it anyway. Chemicals meant to kill pests can also kill this frog. Climate change could hurt this frog by changing the weather it needs. Sometimes people hurt the frog by stopping landslides: the concrete people use to make roads stronger can fill in the cracks in the rocks where frogs would lay their eggs. At least four of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary, Sahyadri Tiger Reserve and the places near it, Tamhini Wildlife Sanctuary, and Kali Tiger Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
