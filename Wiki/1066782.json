 "text": "V4650 Sagittarii is a luminous blue variable (a type of hypergiant star) located in the Sagittarius constellation. It is close to the center of the Milky Way, the galaxy we live in. It is possibly the brightest star known, with a luminosity nearly 8 million times that of the Sun. Although it is very bright, it is also very far away and covered by a lot of dust, which blocks out its light. This means that we cannot see it with our naked eye. V4650 Sagittarii has an effective temperature of 12,000 Kelvins. == References == Category:Stars Category:Sagittarius (constellation) Category:Hypergiants",
