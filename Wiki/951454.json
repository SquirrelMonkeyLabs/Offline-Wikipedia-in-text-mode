The orchesra's theme is based on the hymn tune's first few notes. The hymn tune is sung by the soprano part. The first aria is played by a solo viola and tenor soloist. Bach does not use the solo viola in his cantatas often. The aria's text is a paraphrase (rewriting of a text, keeping its meaning) of the hymn's fourth verse. == References == Category:Church cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach",
