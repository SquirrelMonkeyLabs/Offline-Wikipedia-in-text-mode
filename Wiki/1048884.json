 "text": "\"Home\" is the third single off of Canadian rock band Three Days Grace's first studio album Three Days Grace. The song was released on October 4, 2004. The song was able to make it to #4 on the Mainstream Rock, #2 on the Alternative Airplay, and #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). When asked by MTV in an interview about the song, drummer Neil Sanderson said \"It's about being pushed around and neglected and feeling like even though you're in the company of other people, they're not really there at all.\" A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Dean Karr. In the video, the band plays in a run-down, abandoned building. A woman with black and white makeup wanders around the building. She grabs a bat and smashes a miniature statue of David. She enters a room full of clocks and birdcages where she smashes everything. She goes to where the band is playing and screams. It was shot in the abandoned Lister Block building on James Street in Hamilton, Ontario. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2004 songs Category:Three Days Grace songs Category:Hard rock songs",
