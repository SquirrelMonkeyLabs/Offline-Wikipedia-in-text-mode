He was nicknamed \"The Merthyr Matchstick\" (after his hometown and size) and \"The Matchstick Man\" (also after his size). He turned professional in 1976. He boxed as a bantamweight. He held the bantamweight championship titles in Great Britain and Europe. Before his final bout, he had a record of 25 wins (11 by knockout), one loss and one draw. Owen's only loss was against Spaniard Juan Francisco Rodríguez in 1979. He later beat Rodríguez in a rematch in February 1980. On 19 September 1980, Owen went up against Mexican Lupe Pintor at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, United States. He fought hard but was knocked out by Pintor in the twelfth round, giving victory to the Mexican. Despite surgery, Owen went into a coma and never regained consciousness. He died seven weeks later on 4 November 1980, at the age of 24. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1956 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:British boxers Category:Deaths in sport Category:Welsh sportspeople",
