 "text": "The Goebel Brewing Company was a brewing company in Detroit, Michigan. It was started by August Goebel. It later expanded to produce Goebel Private Stock 22 in Muskegon, Michigan and Oakland, California. From 1950 to 1959, it outsold all other beers in Michigan. The company sponsored the Detroit Lions football team, the Detroit Tigers baseball team, and the Detroit Red Wings hockey team. In 1961, their head brewmaster died. They hired a new brewmaster from Germany and sales fell. In 1964, they sold out to another Detroit brewery, The Stroh Brewing Company. After 150 years, the Goebel Brewing Company was out of business. Stroh produced a cheap beer under the Goebel Beer name for a few years before selling out themselves.
