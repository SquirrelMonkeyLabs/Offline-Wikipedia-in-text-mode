Fry-A man from the year 1999 who finds himself in the year 3000. * Turanga Leela (Katey Sagal)– a cyclops (a creature with only one eye) who is one of Fry's friends. She is the pilot of Old Bessie and the captain of the crew. Fry falls in love with her. For a long time she does not love him back. Fry still tries to win her love many times. Finally they become boyfriend and girlfriend. Leela is brave and good at fighting. She also takes her job very seriously. That sometimes becomes a problem, because she does not give up a mission when it would be better. She has violet hair and wears a white tank top, black trousers and boots. * Bender Bending Rodriguez (John DiMaggio) – a bending robot who is Fry's best friend. He is a kleptomanic. That means that he often steals things by accident or for fun. He drinks a lot of alcohol because that is his fuel. He also smokes cigars. Bender's last name is Rodriguez because he was built in Mexico. He dreams of killing all humans except Fry and becoming a famous country singer. His catchphrases are \"Kiss my shiny metal ass!\" and \"Let's go already!\" * Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth (Billy West) – an inventor and head of Planet Express. He is very old and wears thick eyeglasses, a lab coat and slippers. He is Fry's 30 times great grandnephew and his last living relative. The crew just calls him \"The Professor\". The Professor often invents dangerous things that the crew must get rid of. His catch phrase is \"Good news everyone!\" He says that before telling the crew their next mission. Usually that is not good news for the crew. * Dr. John Zoidberg (Billy West) – a crustacean-like creature from another planet. He is the doctor at Planet Express, although he does not know much about human health. He lives in the dumpster behind the Planet Express building. Dr. Zoidberg often does not know how to behave right because he is an alien. That is why the other Planet Express workers mock him. When he becomes very nervous, a comb unfolds on his head. * Amy Wong - a young woman from Mars. She assists the Professor in his experiments. Her parents are Chinese. She has black hair and wears pink jogging clothes. * Hermes Conrad - a bureaucrat from Jamaica. He does the paperwork for Planet Express and organizes everything.

His son becomes friends with a clone of Professor Farnsworth. * General Zapp Brannigan - the self- absorbed leader of earth's army. He is incompetent but thinks he is the greatest. Zapp has a crush on Leela and tries to take advantage of when she is in danger. She always harshly rejects him because he is so unbearable. His alien assistant Kiff becomes Amy's boyfriend. * Nibbler - a little black alien with pointy canine teeth. The crew saves him from a collapsing planet and he becomes Leela's pet. He can eat animals that are ten times bigger than himself with one bite. He poops dark matter that is used as the fuel for Old Bessie. Nibbler wears a diaper and a red cape. He is actually very intelligent and can speak, but does not show it. He staged the accident that brought Fry to the future so Fry could save the world from an attack of giant hovering brains. ==Setting== The first episode begins in the year 2999 later 3000, a time where there are many technological advancements, as well as a place where 21st century problems are treated as everyday situations.
