 "text": "Alain de Benoist (born 11 December 1943), also known as Fabrice Laroche, Robert de Herte, and David Barney, is a French political thinker and journalist. He helped start the Nouvelle Droite (France's New Right) and leads the ethnic national group GRECE. De Benoist, influenced by German Conservative Revolution thinkers, rejects Christianity, the Declaration of the Rights of Man, neoliberalism, representative democracy, and equality. He believes these ideas are represented by the United States. He developed the idea of ethnopluralism, which focuses on protecting and respecting different ethnic and cultural areas. His work has played a role in the alt-right movement in the U.S., and he gave a talk on identity at a National Policy Institute event organized by Richard B. Spencer; however, he has moved away from the movement. == References == ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:French political writers Category:20th-century French philosophers Category:People from Tours Category:Writers from Centre- Val de Loire",
