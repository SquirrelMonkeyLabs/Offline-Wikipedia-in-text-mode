 "text": "HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy (HAM), also known as Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (TSP) is a disease that affects the spinal cord and nerves going to the legs. It is caused by infection by a virus called HTLV-1. Symptoms of the disease may include: leg weakness, difficulty walking, back pain and problems with urinating. The symptoms are often similar to those of multiple sclerosis. In some cases, patients need to use a wheelchair. The beginning of the disease is often slow, and symptoms are not noticed for some months or years. About 5-10 million people around the world have been infected with HTLV-1. Two percent of them may develop HAM. This means that HAM is a rare disease. There is no cure for HAM, although people can live for many years with the symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms get worse. In other cases, people's symptoms stay stable. Treatment of the disease is focused on relieving the symptoms, and it is important to stay as active as possible. There are higher numbers of people with HAM in southwest Japan, Central, and South America, Asia, central Australia, and Romania. These are areas where HTLV-1 is more common. == Recent treatments == A drug called mogamulizumab has been used to treat HAM recently. 79% of patients treated with this drug have had a reduction in spasticity and 32% showed a decrease in disability. ==References== Category:Diseases caused by viruses Category:Diseases and disorders of the nervous system",
