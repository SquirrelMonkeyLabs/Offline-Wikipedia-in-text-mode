 "text": "Alan Scott is a major character and superhero from the DC Comics universe. He first appeared in All-American Comics #16, in July 1940, and was created by the late Bill Finger and the late Martin Nodell. He is the first human character on Earth to bear the mantle of Green Lantern. As one of the publisher's most popular heroes, Alan became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, one of the first such teams of \"mystery men\" or superheroes in comic books. == Fictional character biography == In his origin, Scott was a simple train engineer who is saved from what would have been a fatal train accident by a magical green engineer's lantern. The lantern's metal was made from a fallen meteorite that had fallen thousands of years ago in China. == Powers and abilities == Scott uses his ring to fly, walk through solid objects by \"moving through the fourth dimension\", paralyze or blind people temporarily, hypnotize them, create rays of energy, melt metal as with a blowtorch, and cause dangerous objects to glow, among other things. It could also allow him and others to time travel. ==References== ==Other websites== *Alan Scott at Comic Vine Category:DC Comics superheroes",
