 "text": "James Arthur Baldwin (August 2, 1924 - December 1, 1987) was an American novelist, essayist, playwright, and social critic. Baldwin's essays, such as the collection Notes of a Native Son (1955), explore racial, sexual, and class matters in Western societies, mostly in mid-20th-century America. He looks at how these large things cause problems for, mostly but not only, African American individuals. ==Life== Baldwin was born on August 2, 1924 in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. He studied at DeWitt Clinton High School and at The New School. Baldwin was gay. He never married and had no children. Baldwin died on December 1, 1987 in Saint-Paul de Vence, France from esophageal cancer, aged 63.James Baldwin Biography, accessed December 2, 2010James Baldwin: His Voice Remembered, The New York Times, December 20, 1987 ==Works== === Novels === *1953.
