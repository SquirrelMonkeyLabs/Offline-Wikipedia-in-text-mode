The publisher chose the subtitle Path√©tique. Tchaikovsky conducted the first performance on 28 October 1893. The work is celebrated for its march-like Scherzo, and its \"limping\" waltz finale with a 5/4 time signature. == References == * Woodstra, Chris, et. al. 2005. All Music Guide to Classical Music.
