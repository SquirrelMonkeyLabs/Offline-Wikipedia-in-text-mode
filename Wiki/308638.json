 "text": "A decagon is a shape with 10 sides and 10 corners. ==Regular decagon== All sides of a regular decagon are the same length. Each corner is 144°. All corners added together equal 1440°. ===Area=== The amount of space a regular decagon takes up is :\\text{Area} = \\frac{5}{2} a^2\\sqrt{5+2\\sqrt{5}}. a is the length of one of its sides. An alternative formula is A = 2.5dt where d is the distance between parallel sides, or the height when the decagon stands on one side as base. By simple trigonometry d = 2t(\\cos{54^\\circ} + \\cos{18^\\circ}). ==Sides== The side of a regular decagon inscribed in a unit circle is \\tfrac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}, where ϕ is the golden ratio, \\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}. ==Dissection of regular decagon== Coxeter states that every parallel-sided 2m-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the regular decagon, m=5, and it can be divided into 10 rhombs, with examples shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 10 of 80 faces in a Petrie polygon projection plane of the 5-cube. A dissection is based on 10 of 30 faces of the rhombic triacontahedron.Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 The list A006245 defines the number of solutions as 62, with 2 orientations for the first symmetric form, and 10 orientations for the other 6.

A regular skew decagon is seen as zig-zagging edges of a pentagonal antiprism, a pentagrammic antiprism, and a pentagrammic crossed-antiprism. A regular skew decagon is seen as zig-zagging edges of a pentagonal antiprism, a pentagrammic antiprism, and a pentagrammic crossed-antiprism. A skew decagon is a skew polygon with 10 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an decagon is not generally defined. A skew zig-zag decagon has vertices alternating between two parallel planes. A regular skew decagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew decagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a pentagonal antiprism, pentagrammic antiprism, and pentagrammic crossed- antiprism with the same D5d, [2+,10] symmetry, order 20. These can also be seen in these 4 convex polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry. The polygons on the perimeter of these projections are regular skew decagons.
