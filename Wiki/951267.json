 "text": "The Cherry Valley massacre (November 11, 1778) was an attack by Iroquois warriors and British soldiers against Americans in Cherry Valley,New York. It happened during the American Revolution and was one of the worst frontier massacres in American history. Americans had just destroyed the Native towns of Oghwaga and Unadilla. The Iroquois were upset and joined Walter Butler, who led the raid against the Americans. Americans were not prepared for the attack, which led to more deaths. == Related pages == * Iroquois Confederacy * American Revolution * Joseph Brant == References == Category:Massacres in the United States Category:American Revolutionary War Category:1770s in New York (state) Category:1778",
