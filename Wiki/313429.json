 "text": "Shooting is when a rifle, shotgun or other weapons which fire a projectile, such as bows or crossbows, are fired. Even the firing of artillery, rockets and missiles can be called shooting. A person who is very good at shooting is a marksman. Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field in hunting, in shooting sports or in combat. Shooting is also an Olympic sport. ==Uses== Shooting is used for hunting birds such as grouse or pheasant, rabbits etc. Sometimes \"shooting\" just means \"hunting\". ==Violence== Shooting is also used in warfare, self-defense, crime, and law enforcement. When someone commits mass shooting of innocent people, it is sometimes caused by misanthropy â€“ the hate of mankind. ==Competitive shooting== In several countries, rifle clubs have been made since the 19th century. Soon, international shooting events were started, including shooting at the Summer Olympics (from 1896) and International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Shooting Championships (from 1897). The ISSF is in charge of Olympic and non- Olympic rifle, pistol and shotgun competitions. However, there are also many national and international shooting sports which other groups are in charge of. ==Shooting supplies== In most countries, those who want to use firearms need a license. Firearms can usually be bought from registered shops. ==Related pages== * Gun * Gun control == Other websites == Category:Summer Olympic sports Category:War Category:Combat",
