It is known for being Cadillacâ€™s first smaller car in the United States since the 1980s. The ATS was built at the Lansing Grand River Assembly in the U.S. state of Michigan and in China. The interior has high-quality materials. The car also has many technology features. ==History== Cadillac started working on the ATS in 2009. They wanted to create a car that could compete with smaller luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series. The car was designed to be lightweight. It had a new platform called the GM Alpha platform. The ATS was first shown to the public in 2012. It went on sale later that year. ==End of production== In 2019, Cadillac stopped making the ATS.
