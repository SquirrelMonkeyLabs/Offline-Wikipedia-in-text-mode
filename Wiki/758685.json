 "text": "In April 2019, Tara Reade said that Joe Biden touched her in a way that made her “feel uncomfortable” during his time as a Senator for Delaware. There were seven other women who said the same thing at the time. In March 2020, she said that Biden sexually assaulted her instead. Reade said that at the time of the assault, she told her mother, her brother, and a friend who worked in Senator Ted Kennedy’s office about what happened, but currently the fan website TaraReadeTruth.com says that there are as many as eight people that she told. In May 2020, it was found that attorney Douglas Wigdor would be representing Reade pro bono. He is known for representing six women who alleged sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein. However, Wigdor stopped representing her later on in the month when news reported that the Monterey District Attorney's Office in Monterey, California was investigating Reade for lying about her school and work experience in court. They had hired her as an expert witness on domestic violence, and she testified during several court cases. The investigation started after many news websites and newspapers reported that she lied about obtaining an undergraduate degree from Antioch University under a \"protected program\". There was no protected program, and she did not receive a degree. The District Attorney's Office decided not to punish her for the lying about the degree, even though they confirmed that she had lied. ==References== Category:2020 in the United States Category:Sexual abuse sexual assault allegation",
