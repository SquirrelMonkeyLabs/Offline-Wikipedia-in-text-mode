 "text": "Achappam is a deep-fried cookie made with rice flour. They are made using patterned irons to give any size or shape. The batter is a mixture of wheat flour, eggs, sugar and whole milk. The iron has a handle and a patterned mould at its end. The iron is heated to a very high temperature in oil. It is then dipped into the batter and then dipped in the hot oil again. The iron is lifted from the oil after the cookie separates from the iron. ==References== Category:Indian food Category:Cookies",
