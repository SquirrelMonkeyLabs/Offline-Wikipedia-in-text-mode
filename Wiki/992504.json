 "text": "The moon wrasse (Thalassoma lunare), also known as the crescent wrasse or lyretail wrasse, is a species of wrasse native to the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. It is an inhabitant of coral reefs and surrounding areas at depths from 1 to 20 m (3.3 to 65.6 ft). Moon wrasses are carnivores and tend to prey on fish eggs and small sea-floor dwelling invertebrates. This species can reach 45 cm (18 in) in total length. It is part of the aquarium trade. == Description == The juvenile is blue on the lower half of its body, with a black spot in the middle of the dorsal fin and a black spot on the caudal fin base. As it matures, the black blotch transforms into a yellow crescent. The body is green, with prominently marked scales. The head's color ranges from blue to magenta, with a broken checkerboard pattern. == Synonyms == * Labrus lunaris Linnaeus, 1758 == References == # Froese, Rainer; Pauly, Daniel (eds.)
