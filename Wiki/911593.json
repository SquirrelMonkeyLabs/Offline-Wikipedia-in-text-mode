They were most often used for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century before the discovery of antibiotics. Sometimes, the word is used to describe different things. For example, in eastern Europe, a \"sanatorium\" is a type of health resort such as the Battle Creek Sanitarium.
