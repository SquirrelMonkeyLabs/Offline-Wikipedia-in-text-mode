This frog in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that are growing back if human beings have not changed them too much. This frog lays eggs in ponds and still water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. People cut down its forests to make palm oil farms and to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
