 "text": "Windows Aero (Backronym: Authentic, Energetic, Reflective and Open) is a design language used mostly in Windows Vista and Windows 7. It changed the appearance of many elements in the Windows interface, including the look and layout. The Aero theme is the default on computers that meet certain hardware and software requirements, and includes animation and transparency effects. If the computer does not meet the requirements for Windows Aero it will default to a basic theme. Other features enabled by Aero include enhanced taskbar previews, window switching with a 3D effect, and the ability to manipulate windows by dragging them to different parts of the screen. However, using Aero requires a video card with certain specifications and is not available on all versions of Windows. Windows Aero can be enabled in Windows 8, but was later completely removed in Windows 10. Third-party software can be used to add the Windows Aero theme to later versions of Windows. == References == Category:Web design Category:Microsoft software",
