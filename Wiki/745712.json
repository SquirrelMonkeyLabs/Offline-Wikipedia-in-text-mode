 "text": "William Leonard Pickard (born October 21, 1945) is an American writer, researcher and convicted drug trafficker. He is one of two people convicted in the largest lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) manufacturing case in history. In 2000, while moving their LSD laboratory across Kansas, Pickard and Clyde Apperson were pulled over by police while driving a rental truck and a follow car. He was later sentenced to serve two life sentences. The DEA has claimed that Pickard's arrest led to a 95% drop in the availability of LSD in the US in the two years after his arrest. In 2015, Pickard published a book, The Rose of Paracelsus: On Secrets and Sacraments. On July 27, 2020, Pickard was given from federal prison 20 years into his sentence. Pickard was born in DeKalb County, Georgia. He attended Harvard University. He also lived in Mill Valley, California. ==References== ==Other websites== *Free William Leonard Pickard Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American people convicted of drug offenses Category:Criminals from California Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Writers from California Category:Writers from Georgia (U.S. state)",
