 "text": "The 8th European Parliament was elected across the European Union in the late days of May 2014 for the 2014-2019 session. The United Kingdom was apportioned to send 73 out of the 751 Member of the European Parliament (MEPs) that are listed below. ==Brexit and the mandate of British MEPs== A non binding- referendum was held on 23 June 2016 to decide whether the UK should leave the EU (Brexit) or remain a member of it. With a majority of voters, 52%, in favour of Brexit, the British government has promised to leave the EU. It is not clear when the UK will effectively leave the EU, this process being unprecedented. Hence, it has not been clarified if these MEPs will remain in their seats until Brexit, if it happened before the subsequent European Parliament election, or if they would remain as MEPs until this Parliament is dissolved in 2019. In any event, if the UK had left the EU before the election of the 9th European Parliament, the mandate of the listed members would be ended on that date, regardless of the process of the Brexit negotiations. ==Contribution of UK political parties within European Parliament political groups== The UK has representation with 73 of the 751 seats of the European Parliament with party contributions within political groups as follows: National party MEPs Political group Governance Labour Party S&D; Commission majority Conservative Party ECR Opposition and non-aligned UK Independence Party EFDD Opposition and non-aligned Green Party Greens/EFA Opposition and non-aligned Scottish National Party Greens/EFA Opposition and non-aligned Independent politician Non-Inscrits Opposition and non-aligned Ulster Unionist Party ECR Opposition and non-aligned Liberal Democrats ALDE Commission majority Sinn Féin GUE/NGL Opposition and non-aligned Plaid Cymru Greens/EFA Opposition and non-aligned Independent ENF Opposition and non-aligned Democratic Unionist Party Non-Inscrits Opposition and non-aligned Conservative Party / Independent EPP Commission majority ==Current members== This table can be sorted by constituency, party or party group: click the symbol at the top of the appropriate column.
