 "text": "Cinemax is a Latin American subscription television channel of American origin. It is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. It is operated by Warner Bros. Discovery Latin America. It launched on September 5, 1993. It is HBO's only basic channel on the continent. During its previous run, the channel was broadcast as a pay-per-view channel. ==History== On September 5, 1993, HBO Olé launched Cinemax, a movie-only channel. It was different from HBO because it did not broadcast concerts or boxing. Instead, it broadcast only movies 24 hours a day. (HBO Olé would only make the transition to 24-hour programming later that year). Cinemax also aired erotic movies, although only after midnight. Cinemax also focused on broadcasting award-winning movies, series, and miniseries from the past and present. It also had a lot of independent content in its broadcasts. This included movies that were not released in theaters and were not shown on any other channel. The channel had two channels to adapt to viewers' schedules: West with Mexico time and East with Argentina time (3 hours behind the West channel). On June 1, 2010, Cinemax East was replaced by Max, while Cinemax West permanently switched to the basic subscription of Latin American television providers. Starting November 1, 2010, its programming and signal structure changed. Original language movies with subtitles were removed. More movies dubbed in Spanish were shown. The base schedule changed from Mexico to Argentina. At the end of 2011, Cinemax regrouped its channels, making each region different: Mexico, South America, Chile, Panregional, and one for Brazil in Portuguese. In 2012, its graphics and programming were changed. They started showing HBO content in addition to more recent series and movies. Currently, the programming features the original voices and the SAP option for Spanish and Portuguese. On September 20, 2014, Cinemax Latin America underwent a complete graphical overhaul (logo, image, and colors) to be the same as its American channel. The on-screen logo change was made official starting at 10:00 p.m. (Chilean time). In Colombia, it started at 9:00 p.m. with the start of The Hunger Games. However, the new image had appeared on its website and social media channels days earlier. Furthermore, the new image had been used in several small advertisements in the years before. The image change consisted of changing the logo that the company had for 16 years. == Notes == Category:Television channels Category:1980 establishments",
