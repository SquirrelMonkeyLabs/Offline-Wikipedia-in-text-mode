 "text": "Richard Douglas Fosbury (March 6, 1947 â€“ March 12, 2023) was an American high jumper. He revolutionized the high jump event in athletics. His invention, the \"Fosbury flop\" was a backwards leap over the bar. This was basically made possible by softer landing material: foam rubber instead of wood chips. Fosbury won the Olympic event in 1968. From that time on, all jumpers changed to his method. He had changed the sport.
