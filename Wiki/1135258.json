 "text": "Xenohormones are chemicals produced outside the human body that can act like hormones. They can come from plants (like phytoestrogens) or be man-made. These chemicals disrupt the activity of our steroid hormones through numerous possible mechanisms of action like - acting directly on hormone receptors, changing in the levels of natural hormones within the body and modifying the function of hormone receptors. The most widely known xenohormones are the xenoestrogens, which mimic the action of estrogen. Other classes include xenoandrogens-electively similar to anabolic steroids-and xenoprogesterones. Xenohormones have applications in products such as oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and agriculture. Exposure to certain xenohormones during critical periods in child development can result in reproductive problems, thyroid problems, and young age at puberty. Later in life, they can increase the risk of cancers like testicular, prostate, ovarian, and uterine cancer. == References == Category:Environmental science Category:Hormones Category:Endocrinology Category:Toxicology",
