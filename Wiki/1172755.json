 "text": "On 28 February 2025, the President of the United States, Donald Trump and the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a tense meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C. The meeting was supposed to end with an agreement on Ukraine's rare earth minerals. Trump and the Vice President of the United States, JD Vance loudly criticized Zelenskyy, often interrupting him. It was the first time a U.S. president had publicly criticized a visiting leader this way. Zelenskyy was asked to leave, and talks were cut off. Before the meeting, the United States wanted Ukraine to compromise with Russia to end the war quickly, but Ukraine didn't trust Russia without the United States security guarantees. The meeting was tense and drew heavy criticism. Most of the United States' allies and global leaders supported Zelenskyy, while Russia praised the outcome and criticized him. In the United States, Republicans mostly backed Trump, while Democrats condemned him. == References == Category:2025 in the United States Category:February 2025 events Category:Donald Trump",
