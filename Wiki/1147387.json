He was killed along with Sambahji in 1689. ==Early Life== Kalash Dev, a Kanyakubja Brahmin from Unnao, was a skilled administrator, warrior, and poet. He defeated Shahabuddin Khan near Raigad in 1684 and played a crucial role in the Agra escape plan. Sambhaji Maharaj honored him with the title Chandogamatya (Pinnacle of Poets). ==Death== In March 1689, Kavi Kalash was captured alongside King Sambhaji by the Mughal army under Aurangzeb in Sangameshwar. While Aurangzeb prayed in thanks for his victory, Kalash composed a defiant poem, comparing Sambhaji’s capture to Hanuman’s restraint in Ravan’s court and mocking Aurangzeb’s loss of power. Enraged, Aurangzeb ordered Kalash’s tongue to be cut out. Both were then paraded and allegedly killed in a gruesome manner using tiger claws. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:India",
