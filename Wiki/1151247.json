 "text": "The Toyota JPN Taxi is a hybrid electric taxi developed by Toyota, designed to meet accessibility and environmental standards set by the Japanese government. Launched in 2017, it was created to replace the Toyota Comfort model and is primarily used in Japan, though it has also been exported to markets such as Hong Kong and Thailand. ==History== The JPN Taxi was first shown as a concept at the 43rd Tokyo Motor Show in 2013 and entered production in 2017. Its development was driven by the Japanese government's mandate for a \"universal design\" for taxis, aimed at better serving all passengers, including those with disabilities. The model was also designed to meet stricter emissions standards and has become an iconic part of public transportation in Japan. ==Features== The JPN Taxi features a hybrid powertrain using Toyota's THS II hybrid system, combining a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with an electric motor. The vehicle is designed for accessibility, with electrically operated sliding rear doors and a spacious interior, including a ramp for wheelchair users. It is equipped with advanced safety features such as collision sensors and multiple airbags. ==Usage== The JPN Taxi has been widely adopted in Japan, especially in Tokyo, where it is a popular choice for taxi companies, supported by government subsidies. It was also introduced in Hong Kong under the name Toyota Comfort Hybrid and, more recently, in Thailand as the Toyota Thai Taxi. ==References== Category:Toyota automobiles Category:2010s automobiles",
