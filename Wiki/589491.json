 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Doubs department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. The arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Doubs department are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 251 Besançon Besançon 248,199 1,942.2 260 252 Montbéliard Montbéliard 176,670 1,255.7 169 253 Pontarlier Pontarlier 109,841 2,034.7 149 ==History== Since its creation, the Doubs department has had few changes: * 1790 : six districts: Besançon, Baume-les-Dames, Saint-Hippolyte, Pontarlier, Quingey and Ornans; Besançon was the capital. * 1800 : the six districts were changed into four arrondissements: Besançon, Baume-les-Dames, Pontarlier and Saint-Hippolyte. * 1816 : the subprefecture of Saint-Hippolyte is moved to Montbéliard. * 1926 : the arrondissement of Baume-les-Dames was eliminated. ==Related pages== * List of arrondissements of France == References ==",
