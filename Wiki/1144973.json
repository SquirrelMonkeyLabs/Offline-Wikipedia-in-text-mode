 "text": "Sir David Stirling (15 November 1915 â€“ 4 November 1990) was a Scottish British Army officer and the founder of the Special Air Service (SAS), a regiment of the British Army renowned for its special operations capability. His contributions during World War II have made him a legendary figure in military history. Known as \"The Phantom Major,\" Stirling revolutionized warfare tactics, specializing in stealth, sabotage, and counter-insurgency, which laid the foundation for modern special forces worldwide. == Early life and education == David Stirling was born on 15 November 1915, in Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, Scotland, into a prominent Scottish family. His father was Brigadier General Archibald Stirling, and he was one of six children. Stirling attended Ampleforth College and later went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied briefly before his adventurous nature led him to drop out. As a young man, Stirling aspired to be an artist and mountaineer, eventually joining an expedition to Mount Everest in 1938, though it was cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/06/obituaries/sir-david-stirling-74-the- founder-of-britain-s-elite-commando-unit.html == Related pages == * Special Air Service * British Army * World War II * Special forces == References == Category:1915 births Category:1990 deaths Category:British military personnel of World War II Category:British Army officers Category:Scottish people",
