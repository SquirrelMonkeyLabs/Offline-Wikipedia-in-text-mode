 "text": "Davies' tree frog (Ranoidea daviesae) is a tree frog from Australia. They live on the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales. The adult male frog is 5.3 cm long and the adult female is 6.3 cm long. This frog is gold-brown in color. Some frogs have green patches. It has a dark stripe from its nose over its eye and down its body. This frog has ears that are hard to see. It has fewer warts than other frogs in its family. Davies' tree frog tadpoles are different from other tadpoles. Their mouths have no beaks or teeth. There are fewer Davies' tree frogs than there were. The IUCN Red List says they are a vulnerable species. Scientists say there are fewer Davies' tree frogs because human beings have changed their places where they live from forests, because of predators, and because there are not enough Davies' tree frogs in one place for them to find unrelated partners and make healthy offspring. They also think the fungus disease chytridiomycosis could kill Davies' tree frogs but no scientist had seen any frogs sick with it as of 2007. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
