His last movie role was in Hall Pass. Murphy was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Murphy was a quadriplegic (handicapped) after a diving accident that took place at Martha's Vineyard in 1974. His friend and director, Peter Farrelly, was with him at the accident. Murphy criticized Farrelly for not including handicapped people in his movie Dumb & Dumber. This led to Murphy's first movie role in Farrelly's comedy movie Kingpin. Murphy died in Florida from cancer, aged 58. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1955 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in Florida Category:American movie actors Category:Actors from Boston",
