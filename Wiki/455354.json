He began his career at 1. FSV Mainz 05, then went to Bayer 04 Leverkusen. His performances at that club got Chelsea interested in him, and in 2013 he was sold to Chelsea for £18 million.

He was a member of the German squads which reached the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 2012 and won the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
