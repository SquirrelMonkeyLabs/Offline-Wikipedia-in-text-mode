 "text": "The 2020 Belarusian protests, nicknamed the Slipper Revolution, and the Anti- Cockroach Revolution are a series of street protests against Belarus's president Alexander Lukashenko. They began on 24 March 2020. The protests are part of the Belarusian democracy movement. They are upset over the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, in which Lukashenko was controversially re- elected. Many believed the election was rigged and unfair. Support from Russian President Vladimir Putin helped Alexander Lukashenko hold on, and the security forces started attacking people from the opposite side. There were more than 600 political prisoners as of August 2021. These numbers came from the Viasna Human Rights Centre. Tens of thousands of people have been arrested and thousands have left the country. ==References== Category:2020 in Europe Category:August 2020 events 2020 protests Category:July 2020 events Category:June 2020 events Category:May 2020 events 2020 protests Category:September 2020 events",
