 "text": "Joseph Henry \"Bad Joe\" Hall (May 3, 1881 - April 5, 1919) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. Hall played senior and professional hockey from 1902 to 1919, when he died as a result of the influenza epidemic of 1918. He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Quebec Bulldogs and once with the Kenora Thistles. ==Playing career== Hall was born in Staffordshire, England, United Kingdom and grew up in Brandon, Manitoba. Nicknamed \"Bad Joe\" for his aggressiveness on the ice, he played in the Manitoba Hockey Association with the Brandon Wheat Kings, Winnipeg Rowing Club and the Kenora Thistles, and in the National Hockey Association as a member of the Quebec Bulldogs. He played for the Montreal Canadiens in their first two seasons in the National Hockey League from 1917-1919. Hall won the Stanley Cup with the Kenora Thistles in 1907, for which he received a \"loving cup\" which is on display in the Hockey Hall of Fame. He won the Cup with the Quebec Bulldogs in 1912 and 1913. He also challenged for the Stanley Cup in 1904 with the Winnipeg Rowing Club. ===1919 Stanley Cup Final=== In 1919, Hall was part of the Montreal Canadiens team that made it to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Finals were interrupted and eventually cancelled due to an outbreak of Spanish influenza. The flu was contracted by several players on both the Canadiens and their opponents, the Seattle Metropolitans. Hall would eventually succumb to pneumonia, related to his influenza, in a hospital in Seattle, Washington just four days after the Stanley Cup Final series was abandoned. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1901–02 Brandon HC MNWHA 10 11 0 11 8 — — — — — 1902–03 Brandon HC MNWHA 6 9 0 9 — — — — — — 1903–04 Winnipeg Rowing Club MHA 6 6 0 6 — — — — — — 1903–04 Winnipeg Rowing Club St-Cup — — — — — 3 1 0 1 — 1904–05 Brandon HC MPHL 8 11 0 11 — — — — — — 1905–06 Portage Lakes IHL 20 33 0 33 98 — — — — — 1905–06 Quebec Bulldogs ECAHA 3 2 0 2 3 — — — — — 1906–07 Brandon HC MPHL 10 15 1 16 32 2 5 0 5 5 1907–08 Montreal HC ECAHA 4 5 0 5 11 — — — — — 1907–08 Montreal Shamrocks ECAHA 4 4 0 4 6 — — — — — 1908–09 Edmonton HC APHL 1 8 0 8 6 — — — — — 1908–09 Montreal Wanderers ECHA 5 10 0 10 18 — — — — — 1908–09 Winnipeg Maple Leafs MPHL 2 2 1 3 0 2 2 1 3 9 1909–10 Montreal Shamrocks NHA 10 8 0 8 47 — — — — — 1909–10 Montreal Shamrocks CHA 1 7 0 7 6 — — — — — 1910–11 Quebec Bulldogs NHA 10 0 0 0 20 — — — — — 1911–12 Quebec Bulldogs NHA 18 15 0 15 30 — — — — — 1911–12 Quebec Bulldogs St-Cup — — — — — 2 2 0 2 2 1912–13 Quebec Bulldogs NHA 17 8 0 8 78 — — — — — 1912–13 Quebec Bulldogs St-Cup — — — — — 2 3 0 3 0 1913–14 Quebec Bulldogs NHA 19 13 4 17 61 — — — — — 1914–15 Quebec Bulldogs NHA 20 3 2 5 52 — — — — — 1915–16 Quebec Bulldogs NHA 23 1 2 3 89 — — — — — 1916–17 Quebec Bulldogs NHA 19 6 5 11 95 — — — — — 1917–18 Montreal Canadiens NHL 21 8 7 15 100 2 0 1 1 12 1918–19 Montreal Canadiens NHL 17 7 1 8 89 5 0 0 0 26 1918–19 Montreal Canadiens St-Cup — — — — — 5 0 0 0 6 NHA totals 137 52 17 69 489 — — — — — NHL totals 38 15 8 23 189 7 0 1 1 38 St-Cup totals — — — — — 12 6 0 6 — ==Awards and achievements== *IHL First Team All-Star (1906) *Stanley Cup Championships (1907 - Kenora, 1912 & 1913 - Quebec) *Inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961 *\"Honoured Member\" of the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame ==In fiction== *In Roy MacGregor's The Ghost of the Stanley Cup in his The Screech Owls series of hockey books, \"Bad\" Joe Hall is named as the haunting spirit. ==Other websites== * *Joe Hall's biography at Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame * Category:1881 births Category:1919 deaths Category:Deaths from influenza Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Category:Ice hockey people from Brandon, Manitoba Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:Montreal Wanderers players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Quebec Bulldogs (NHA) players",
