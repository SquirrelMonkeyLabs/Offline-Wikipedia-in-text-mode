 "text": "The Yonaguni language (与那国物言, Dunan-munui) is one of the six Ryukyuan languages. It is spoken by some people on Yonaguni, which is an island next to Taiwan and Ishigaki. Only half of Yonaguni's people speak the language, and most of them are over the age of 50. Yonaguni locals also speak Japanese. It has the most similarities with the Yaeyama language, and both languages form the Macro-Yaeyama language group of the Southern Ryukyuan languages. == References == Category:Ryukyuan languages Category:Okinawa Prefecture",
