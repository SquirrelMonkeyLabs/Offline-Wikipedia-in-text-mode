 "text": "Ice on Fire is the 19th studio album by Elton John and was released on 4 November, 1985. It was his first album since 1976 album Blue Moves to feature long-time producer Gus Dudgeon. It went to the top ten in Australia, Austria, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. It charted poorly in the United States. ==Track listing== * Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1â€“10 on CD reissues. Notes *The remastered 1999 version did not include \"Act of War\"; the 1999 remaster had a longer intro to \"Satellite\" than the LP and the 1985 CD issue, and has a slightly different vocal mix. The live version of \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" is not the version found on the 12\" single of \"Nikita\", but is an unreleased version from 1977 (Live at Rainbow Rock in May). It is unknown why the switch occurred. The other two live tracks were recorded at Wembley Stadium during the tour for the album Breaking Hearts. *\"The Man Who Never Died\" is a song written about John Lennon, in addition to \"Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)\", from Elton John's album Jump Up! ==References== Category:1985 albums Category:Elton John albums",
