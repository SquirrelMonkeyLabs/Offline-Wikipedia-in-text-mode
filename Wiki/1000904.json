It has large disks on its toes for cimbing trees. ==Eggs== This frog moves around at night. It climbs trees. The female frog lays eggs in fern plants that grow on trees. The eggs hatch into small froglets. They are never tadpoles. ==Threats== This frog is in danger because human beings change the places where it lives. Humans cut down trees in forests to get wood to build with. Humans let animals eat grass where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
