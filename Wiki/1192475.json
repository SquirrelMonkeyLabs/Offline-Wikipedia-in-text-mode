 "text": "Tarekeniwal was a Nubian King of Meroë of whom little is known. He likely reigned in the second half of the CE 2nd century. Tarekeniwal is only known from his pyramid in Meroe (Beg. N 19). His name appears on the pylon of the cult chapel in front of the pyramid, which was in modern times restored. The chapel and its decoration is still well preserved. Imagery in Tarekeniwal's tomb places unusually strong emphasis on him as a triumphant warrior. The offering table of the later king Aritenyesbokhe identifies Aritenyesbokhe ruler as a son of Tarekeniwal, presumably the same person as the king. The table also identifies Amanikhalika as Aritenyesbokhe's mother and thus as Tarekeniwal's queen. == Images == File:Aethiopen. Begerauîeh (Begrawiya). Pyramidengruppe A. Pyr. 31.
