It was caused by Prime Minister James Marape's tax deduction announcement which was later fixed. The riots had arson, looting and civil unrests. At least 16 people were killed. Marape later declared a state of emergency for 14 days and suspended the country's police chief and top officials in the finance and treasury ministries. ==References== Category:January 2024 events Category:21st century in Papua New Guinea Category:2020s riots Category:2020s fires Category:Mass murder in 2024 Category:Arson Category:Looting",
