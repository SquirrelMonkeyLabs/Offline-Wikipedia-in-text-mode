 "text": "bdnews24.com is an English and Bengali language news portal based in Bangladesh. == History == In 2005, Bangladesh's first web-based news agency called BDNEWS was started. The website bdnews24.com initiated by Ahmed Yasir Riad was the first ever bilingual news site of the country working on 24Ã—7 modules. Till then, two others were the major news agencies: Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, or BSS, and United News of Bangladesh, or UNB, both of which relied on teleprinters. In mid-2006 Bangladesh News 24 Hours Ltd took over the company. Its new owners are Toufique Imrose Khalidi and Asif Mahmood. In October 2006, bdnews24.com was restarted as the first free online newspaper in Bangladesh. Khalidi, formerly with BBC was made the chief editor. On May 28th, 2012, machete-wielding men stormed the office of bdnews24.com and injured three journalists. == References == Category:Newspapers in Asia Category:English-language newspapers published in Asia Category:Organisations based in Bangladesh Category:Bengali-language newspapers published in Asia",
