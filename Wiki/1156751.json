Fangchengbao's first vehicle, the Bao 5, was launched at the Chengdu Auto Show in August 2023, and The Bao 5 was built on a custom- designed body-on-frame platform known as DMO (Dual Mode Off-road).

However, the company faced some challenges in July 2024 when it lowered the price of the Bao 5 by 50,000 yuan to improve its competitiveness against rival brands, notably Great Wall Motor's Tank series. The price cut led to protests from early buyers, some of whom were dissatisfied with the price change after having waited months for delivery. Protesters displayed banners with statements such as, \"I waited 3 months for car delivery, then Fangchengbao cuts 50,000 yuan in one day. I should have bought a Tank instead.\" == Models == * Fangchengbao Bao 5 (2023–present), mid- size SUV, PHEV * Fangchengbao Bao 8 (2024–present), full-size SUV, PHEV * Fangchengbao Tai 3 (upcoming), compact SUV, BEV File:2024 Fangchengbao Bao 5.jpg|Fangchengbao Bao 5 File:2024 Fangchengbao Bao 8 (front).jpg|Fangchengbao Bao 8 ===Concept models=== * Fangchengbao Super 3, concept, battery electric compact SUV with roof rack-mounted drone hangar, later turned into production model as Tai 3 * Fangchengbao Super 9 concept, battery electric supercar File:Fangchengbao Super 3 001.jpg|Fangchengbao Super 3 File:Fangchengbao Super 9 001.jpg|Fangchengbao Super 9 == References == Category:Automobile brands Category:BYD automobiles Category:Chinese automobiles",
