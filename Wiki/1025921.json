 "text": "Engineering Announcements for the Radio and Television Trade sometimes called Engineering Announcements, was a weekly programme meant for technicians and salespeople in the United Kingdom. The show was produced and transmitted by the Independent Television Authority from 1970-1972 and the Independent Broadcasting Authority from 1972-1990. The show was made from 23 November 1970 until 31 July 1990, lasting 19 years and 10 months. Engineering Announcements was cancelled due to the end of the IBA in 1991. == Scheduling == Engineering Announcements was originally aired after Monday's Newcomers, another ghost programme where the advertising trade could watch runs of new adverts before they properly aired on ITV. It was shown at 9:45 am. In September 1972, Engineering Announcements was moved from 9:45 am on Mondays to 9:10 am on Tuesdays. The programme would continue to use the slot until February 1983. Due to the launch of TV-am, Engineering Announcements would be unable to continue its previous slot and moved to 9:17 am. This slot would be used until 17 May when the final edition put out on ITV was aired. == References == Category:ITV television programmes Category:Channel 4 television programmes",
