 "text": "Samrakoon's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus samarakoon) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Sripada Peak in the Peak Wilderness, between 1,000 and 1,400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 22.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 22.4-24.6 mm long. The skin of the frog's back and tops of the legs is the white color of milk with light brown and dark brown marks. There is a dark brown mark between the eyes and another one in front of the eyes. The belly is lighter in color than the back. The front of the neck is brown in color. The webbed skin on the feet is light brown in color. This frog looks different from other frogs in Pseudophilautus. It is smaller in size and has flaps of skin on its feet. People have seen this frog sitting on bamboo shrubs as high as 2 meters above the ground. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities, to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
