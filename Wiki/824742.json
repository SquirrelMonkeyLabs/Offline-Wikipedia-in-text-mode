 "text": "\"We shall fight on the beaches\" is a speech by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 4 June 1940. This was the second of three major speeches given during the Battle of France. The others are the \"Blood, toil, tears and sweat\" speech of 13 May and the \"This was their finest hour\" speech of 18 June. In this speech, Churchill had to describe a great military disaster, and warn of a possible invasion attempt by Nazi Germany, without saying that the British might not have a victory. It is thought to be one of the best speeches made by Churchill or any other British prime minister. â€“ other sources give other occasions for the remark ==References== Category:Speeches Category:1940 in Europe Category:1940s in the United Kingdom",
