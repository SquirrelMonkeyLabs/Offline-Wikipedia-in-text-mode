Excel was influenced by street art and known for painting graffiti on the streets of the cities where they played their shows. Excel was also known for jumping on stage with other bands from Venice such as No Mercy, Beow√ºlf, Suicidal Tendencies (with whom Excel are very close friends) and Cryptic Slaughter, and sometimes with other thrash metal bands like Testament and Overkill. Excel has released three studio albums, three split albums, five demos, three singles and two live albums. They broke up in 1995.
