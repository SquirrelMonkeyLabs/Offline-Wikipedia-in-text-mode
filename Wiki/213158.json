 "text": "The Aachener Turn- und Sportverein Alemannia 1900 (known as Alemannia Aachen) is a football club which plays in Germany's Regionalliga. The club is based in Aachen. The name Alemannia should stress being from the west of Germany. The club was founded in 1900 by students who played football. == Stadium == Alemannia Aachen used to play at the Old Tivoli stadium which had a capacity of 21,632 spectators (3,632 seats). It was built in 1908 and was renovated several times. The club played its 2004 UEFA Cup matches, however, in Cologne's RheinEnergieStadion. In August 2009 the new stadium, the New Tivoli was opened, which has a capacity of 32,960 spectators (11,681 in standing areas). == Nickname == Alemannia has the strange nickname of the \"Potato Beetles\". This is because of their striped yellow-black jerseys, which make them look like the beetles. ==Current squad== ==Coaching history== Alemannia Aachen coaching history from 1987 to present * Diethelm Ferner – 1987 * Peter Neururer – 1987–1989 * Rolf Grünther – 1989 * Mustafa Denizli – 1989–1990 * Eckhard Krautzun – 1990 * Norbert Wagner – 1990–1991 * Michael Schleiden – 1991 * Wilfried Hannes – 1991–1994 * Helmut Graf – 1994 * Gerd vom Bruch – 1994–1996 * Werner Fuchs – 1996–1999 * André Winkhold – 1999 * Eugen Hach – 1999–2001 * Jörg Berger – 2001–2004 * Dieter Hecking – 2004–2006 * Michael Frontzeck – 2006–2007 * Guido Buchwald – 2007 * Jörg Schmadtke – 2007 * Jürgen Seeberger – 2008–2009 * Willi Kronhardt 2009 * Michael Krüger 2009–2010 * Peter Hyballa 2010–2011 * Friedhelm Funkel 2011–2012 * Ralf Außem 2011, 2012 * René van Eck 2012–2013 * Peter Schubert 2013–2015 * Christian Benbennek 2015 * Fuat Kılıç 2015–2020 * Stefan Vollmerhausen 2020–2021 * Kristoffer Andersen 2021 * Patrick Helmes 2021 * Fuat Kılıç 2021– ==References== Category:Aachen Category:Football clubs in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:1900 establishments in Germany",
