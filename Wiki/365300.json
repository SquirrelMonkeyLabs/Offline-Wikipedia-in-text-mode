 "text": "A metalloprotein is a protein with a metal ion cofactor. Many proteins are members of this category, so the number of them is large. It is estimated that about half of all proteins contain a metal.Thomson A.J. & Gray H.B. 1998. \"Bio-inorganic chemistry\". Current Opinion in Chemical Biology. 2, 155-158. In another estimate, about one-quarter to one-third of all proteins need metals to carry out their functions. Thus, metalloproteins have many different functions in cells, such as enzymes, transport and storage proteins, and signal transduction proteins. == References == == Related pages == *Organometallic chemistry Category:Proteins",
