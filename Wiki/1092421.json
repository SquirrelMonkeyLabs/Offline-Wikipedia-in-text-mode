The song had to represent Ukraine in Eurovision Song Contest 2020, but the competition was stopped by the COVID-19 pandemic. == Background == The musical genre of the song is folktronica, a mix between electronic dance music and folk. The song lyrics are about a girl, Katrusia (nickname for \"Kateryna\"), that lives in the Ukrainian countryside. She falls in love with a boy, Vaniusha (nickname for \"Ivan\"), but the mother does not approve it. The girl meets him at night and she asks a nightingale not to sing early, because the bird may wake up other people. Katrusia knows that their love is not possible and tries to forget him. The story is based on the singer Kateryna Pavlenko's personal story. The lyrics, all in the Ukrainian language, are in an iambic pentameter verse, the main metre in Slavic folk poetry and drama. == Eurovision Song Contest == On 22 February 2020, \"Solovey\" won Vidbir 2020 with 12 points, the highest number of points in Vidbir. The winner song of that competition becomes the representative Ukrainian song for Eurovision Song Contest.

Go_A then went to Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with \"Shum\". \"Solovey\" is the first song in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest to be fully in the Ukrainian language. == References == Category:2020 songs Category:Electronic dance music songs Category:Go_A Category:Songs in Ukrainian Category:Ukrainian folk songs",
