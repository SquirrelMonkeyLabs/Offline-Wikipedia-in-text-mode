It stars Max von Sydow, Gunnar Björnstrand, Bengt Ekerot, Nils Poppe, Inga Landgré, Bibi Andersson, Åke Fridell, Inga Gill. The theme of the film is a knight's return to his country at the time of the Black Death, that is, the plague in Europe of the Middle Ages. As he lands on the shore he meets the figure of Death in person. This is the scene of a famous chess-playing episode where the two play for the knight's soul. The game is unfinished. After bargaining with Death for a while, the knight sets out on his travels. The travels show the damage done by the plague to all aspects of life in the country. To some critics, the film is typical of the existentialist films of the mid-20th century. The knight is the gaunt figure of Max von Sydow at the start of his long film career. He was one of the actors whose career started with working for the film's producer Ingmar Bergman. ==Other websites== * * Category:1957 fantasy movies Category:1950s historical movies Category:Swedish fantasy movies Category:Movies directed by Ingmar Bergman Category:Movies set in the 14th century Category:Movies set in Sweden Category:Movies about witchcraft Category:Movies about death",
