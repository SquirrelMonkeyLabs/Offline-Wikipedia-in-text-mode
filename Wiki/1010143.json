 "text": "The tribitary flying frog, green tree frog, emerald green tree frog, or emerald tree frog (Zhangixalus prasinatus) is a frog. It lives in northern Taiwan. People have seen it between 400 and 600 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 48 to 63 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 65 to 77 mm long. This frog is green in color with a yellow stripe on each side and a white belly. It has disks for climbing on all of its toes. Its front and back feet have webbed skin. Sometimes it has spots. This frog is threatened because human beings change the places where it lives to build farms, towns, and places for other animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
