 "text": "Mary Jean Damron (April 17, 1954 â€“ December 26, 2024) was an American missionary and humanitarian who was known for her work with Christian humanitarian aid organization Samaritan's Purse and the Operation Christmas Child program in the 1990s. She traveled to Bosnia and Herzegovina and several other war-torn countries during her years as a missionary, delivering gift- filled shoeboxes to children affected by poverty or war. In 1995, Damron was invited to the White House. She met U.S. President Bill Clinton and spoke at a press conference hosted by the president. She encouraged President Clinton to pack a shoebox, along with First Lady Hillary Clinton. The shoeboxes were delivered to a 7-year-old girl named Zlada in Bosnia who lost her leg in an artillery attack. Damron died on December 26, 2024 at age 70, after battling cancer for many years. == References == Category:1954 births Category:2024 deaths Category:American people",
