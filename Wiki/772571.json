 "text": "A stripper clip is speedloader used to load bullets into a rifle more quickly so that soldiers can fully load a rifle all at once, rather than to load bullets one at a time. It is mostly used for directly loading bolt-action rifles, but it can also load bullets into magazines as well. It is different from a magazine because the person loading the gun must push the bullets off of the clip into the firearm. Category:Ammunition",
