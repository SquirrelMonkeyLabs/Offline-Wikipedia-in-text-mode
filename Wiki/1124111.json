 "text": "Vandar Adg of the Blood Tribe, more widely known as Vandal Savage, is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Alfred Bester and Martin Nodell. He first appeared in Green Lantern #10 (1943). == Fictional character biography == He is an immortal warrior who intends to conquer the planet. Thousands of years ago, as a caveman during the Prehistoric Era, he was exposed to a meteorite that enhanced his physiology. He was the inspiration for the biblical figure Cain, having committed the first recorded murder, making him an important figure in the Religion of Crime. Throughout the ages he has been an influential figure in history, manipulating many of its greatest conflicts. In the modern era he regularly fights against the Justice Society of America, his greatest enemies. Master of planning and many forms of combat, having survived and adapted through countless centuries, Savage is an extremely dangerous and formidable opponent. Although his campaigns frequently meet with heavy resistance, he is resilient in the knowledge that he will outlive all those who oppose him. Vandal has fathered thousands of children, but the only one he truly considers his heir is his daughter Scandal Savage; and he is also the ancestor of superhero Roy Harper, Green Arrow's first sidekick. == In other media == The character made his live-action debut in Smallville as his alias, Curtis Knox, in the episode, \"Cure\", portrayed by Dean Cain. He then appeared in the Arrowverse crossover event \"Heroes Join Forces\" between the television series The Flash and Arrow, played by Casper Crump. Crump later reprised the role in the television series Legends of Tomorrow. ==References== Category:DC Comics supervillains",
