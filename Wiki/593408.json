 "text": "Mary Allin Travers (November 9, 1936 â€“ September 16, 2009) was an American singer-songwriter and member of the folk music group Peter, Paul and Mary, along with Peter Yarrow and (Noel) Paul Stookey. Peter, Paul and Mary was one of the most successful folk-singing groups of the 1960s. Unlike most folk musicians of the early 1960s who were a part of the burgeoning music scene in the Village, Travers grew up there. She sang in the contralto range. Travers died on September 16, 2009 from complications of bone marrow transplant due to leukemia in Danbury, Connecticut at the age of 72. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Deaths from leukemia Category:Deaths from surgical complications Category:Cancer deaths in Connecticut Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American folk singers Category:American pop singers Category:Writers from Louisville, Kentucky Category:Singers from Louisville, Kentucky",
