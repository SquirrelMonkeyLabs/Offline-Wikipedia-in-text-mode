 "text": "Miramax, LLC is an American motion picture distribution and production company. It was headquartered in Los Angeles, California before being bought out by The Walt Disney Company. It was created by the brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein in Buffalo, New York in 1979. The name comes from combining the first names of their parents Max and Miriam. The company was created to distribute independent films which the major movie studio did not think were worth distributing. The company's first success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producer Martin Lewis. They got the US rights to two concert movies of benefit shows for human rights organization Amnesty International. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to combine the two movies into one movie. The movie The Secret Policeman's Other Ball was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. Among the company's most well known movies as distributors were The Crying Game, sex, lies, and videotape, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! and Scandal. The company also made movies such as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare In Love Miramax also produced many movies which made a lot of money. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film revolution of the 1990s. It produced or distributed seven movies that made more than $100 million at the box office. Its most successful movie, Chicago, earned more than $300 million. In 1993, The Walt Disney Company bought Miramax for $80 million. Harvey and Bob Weinstein ran Miramax until they left the company on September 30, 2005. The Weinstein brothers ran Miramax separately of other Disney companies. However, Disney had the final say on what Miramax could release. Miramax also has a family films division, Miramax Family Films. Miramax is one of the Big Ten movie studios. In 2011, Disney sold the Miramax library of movies to Filmyard Holdings for $663 million. After the sale, Miramax signed home video distribution deals with Lionsgate, Echo Bridge and .StudioCanal. In 2016, Miramax was sold to beIN Media Group. In 2019, beIN sold 49 percent of Miramax to Paramount Pictures, which will distribute all of Miramax's movies. == List of Miramax films == === 1980s === Release date Title Notes November 26, 1980 Rockshow May 8, 1981 The Burning produced by Miramax; distributed by Filmways December 11, 1981 Spaced Out May 21, 1982 The Secret Policeman's Other Ball US version December 23, 1983 Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars US distribution with 20th Century Fox April 27, 1984 Eréndira June 3, 1984 Édith et Marcel August 23, 1985 Crossover Dreams October 25, 1985 The Dog Who Stopped the War March 14, 1986 Cool Change May 1, 1986 The Quest September 26, 1986 Twist and Shout October 3, 1986 Playing for Keeps produced by Miramax but distributed by Universal Pictures February 27, 1987 Working Girls March 27, 1987 Ghost Fever September 11, 1987 I've Heard the Mermaids Singing December 11, 1987 Crazy Moon December 22, 1987 The Magic Snowman US distribution only January 22, 1988 The Grand Highway January 29, 1988 Light Years March 18, 1988 Aria May 7, 1988 Riders of the Storm May 20, 1988 Caribe June 10, 1988 The Land of Faraway June 17, 1988 Going Undercover August 25, 1988 The Thin Blue Line North American distribution only September 23, 1988 Murder One December 2, 1988 Dakota December 21, 1988 Pelle the Conqueror US distribution only March 31, 1989 Warm Nights on a Slow Moving Train March 31, 1989 Edge of Sanity first film released under Millimeter Films label April 28, 1989 Scandal North American distribution only May 12, 1989 The Return of Swamp Thing released under Millimeter Films label August 4, 1989 Sex, Lies, and Videotape distribution only August 25, 1989 The Little Thief September 29, 1989 The Girl in a Swing released under Millimeter Films label October 27, 1989 Animal Behavior released under Millimeter Films label November 3, 1989 Stepfather II released under Millimeter Films label November 10, 1989 My Left Foot US distribution only; nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture; produced by Granada Television === 1990s === Release date Title Notes January 26, 1990 Strike It Rich released under Millimeter Films label February 9, 1990 Torrents of Spring released under Millimeter Films label February 23, 1990 Cinema Paradiso US distribution only April 6, 1990 The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover US distribution only April 13, 1990 Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed May 4, 1990 Tie Me Up!
