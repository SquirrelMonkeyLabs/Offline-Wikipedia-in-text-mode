She was, therefore, a sister-in-law of Emperor Shōwa and an aunt of the present Emperor, Akihito. After her husband's death from Tuberculosis in 1953, Princess Chichibu became president of the Japanese Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, honorary president of the Britain-Japan Society, the Sweden- Japan Society, and an honorary vice president of the Japanese Red Cross. She also maintained close links with old friends active in similar social service ventures around the world. She died in August 1995 of heart failure.
