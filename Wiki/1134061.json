 "text": "South Tapanuli (, abbreviated as Tapsel) is a regency located in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Its seat is the town of Sipirok. The regency was originally very large, containing thousands of towns and villages, including the city of Padang Sidempuan. The areas that separated from South Tapanuli Regency are the new regencies of Mandailing Natal (created on 23 November 1998), Padang Lawas Utara, and Padang Lawas (both created on 17 July 2007), plus the city (kota) of Padang Sidempuan (created on 21 June 2001). After the division, the regency seat moved from Padang Sidempuan to Sipirok. The regency covers an area of 4,355.35 square kilometers and had a population of 264,108 at the 2010 Census and 300,911 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 312,540 (comprising 157,340 males and 155,200 females). These figures exclude the city of Padang Sidempuan, which is virtually surrounded by South Tapanuli territory but is independently administered. == Administration == At the 2010 Census, the regency was divided into twelve districts (kecamatan). Subsequently, three additional districts (Tano Tombangan Angkola, Angkola Muara Tais, and Angkola Sangkunur) have been created by the division of existing districts. The districts are tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as of mid-2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centers, the number of administrative villages in each district (totaling 211 rural desa and 37 urban kelurahan), and its postcode.
