Pita is often round, brown, wheat flatbread made with yeast. Pita is traditionally made in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean. It is also used in the cuisines of these countries. It can also be found in North Africa and the Levant. Possibly, it was spread by the Ancient Greek city states colonies, or by the spread of the Islam through the region. In Turkish cuisine, pide may refer to thicker breads made with yeast, for example shish kebab pide. It may also refer to foods using many thin layers of dough, usually with many different ingredients in between. That way, pies such as tyropita and spanakopita or sweet pies such as baclava are made. The Indian flatbread form of roti is sometimes referred to as \"Indian pita\". ==References== Category:Middle Eastern foods Category:Turkish food Category:Greek food Category:Azerbaijani food Category:Persian food Category:Flatbreads",
