An unusually high number of Reed's students go on to get Ph.D.s after they graduate. Reed is the only private undergraduate school to have a nuclear reactor. Tuition at Reed is $69,040 for the 2024-2025 school-year. This does not include housing, books, or other expenses. Reed is secular, meaning the school is not part of a religion. The school does not do very many NCAA sports, and it does not have any fraternities or sororities. Reed students are called \"Reedies\". Students are often called nonconformists. As a joke, some students say the motto of the school is \"Communism, Atheism, Free Love\". ==People== Some famous or important people who went to Reed include: * James Beard - Chef, cookbook author, teacher and television personalityInternet Archive of Reed Magazine, Was James Beard Really a Reedie?, May 10, 2011, Retrieved January 20, 2025 * Bud Clark - Mayor of Portland from 1985 to 1992. * Richard Danzig - 71st United States Secretary of the Navy * Suzan DelBene - United States representative from Washington's 1st congressional district since 2012. * Richard L.
