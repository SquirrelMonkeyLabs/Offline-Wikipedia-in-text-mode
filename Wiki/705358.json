 "text": "Neoconservatism (often shortened as neocon) is a form of American conservatism that emphasizes an aggressive American foreign policy. It started in the United States during the 1960s. Neocons supported the Vietnam war, but disliked the Democratic party, Great Society, and the New Left. Neoconservative sometimes refers to people who started as anti-Stalinists and then became American conservatives during the 1960s and 1970s. == Examples == Some neocons are Republicans, like the United States Presidents from the 1970s to the 2000s. For example, George W. Bush started the 2003 invasion of Iraq. His neocon advisors include Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, and Paul Bremer. Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are also often said to be Neocons. They supported the defence of Israel during the Second Intifada and the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Very few of those people actually called themselves Neoconservatives though. Some people who call themselves Neoconservatives are Douglas Murray and Reihan Salaam. == Where it came from == The idea started in the 1960s with Jewish magazine Commentary, edited by Norman Podhoretz and published by the American Jewish Committee.Mm They opposed the New Left and thus started the neocon movement. The name was invented in the 1970s. ==References== Category:Conservatism",
