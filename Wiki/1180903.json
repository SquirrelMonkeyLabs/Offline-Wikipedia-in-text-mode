 "text": "Tropical Storm Odette was a rare out-of-season tropical storm that affected the Caribbean Sea in December of 2003. The fifteenth tropical storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season, Odette formed near the coast of Panama a few days after the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season, and ultimately made landfall on the Dominican Republic as a moderate tropical storm. With the hurricane season officially over the last day of November, Odette became one of the rare, Atlantic tropical storms and the first Caribbean tropical storm to form in the month of December. After forming in the central Caribbean on December 4, 2003, Odette moved northeastward ahead of an approaching trough and struck the southern coast of the Dominican Republic on the evening of the 6th with maximum sustained winds estimated at just over 50 miles per hour. Subsequent flooding caused two deaths. Category:2003 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Hurricanes in the Dominican Republic",
