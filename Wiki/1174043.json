Twin City Lines was a transit company from the time of horse carriages. Twin City Lines had 635 buses. Most Twin City Lines buses were over 15 years old. A few buses were not allowed in Minneapolis because they were too old. Workers quit until Twin City Lines could be improved. === Expansion === Metro Transit had been trying to buy Twin City Lines since 1965. It was sold 4 years later. Metro Transit built 93 buses and 135 bus stops. A 24-hour information center was made soon after. By 1975, Metro Transit bought four other bus companies. 650 new buses were built. === Government === In 1994, Metro Transit became a part of the Minnesota Government. Metro Transit changed its name to the Metropolitan Council Transit Operations. It was changed back soon after. === New Lines === In 1998, Hennepin County raised money for the light rail. A year later, governor Jesse Ventura got money from the state. The Light Rail had its first trip on June 26, 2004, just over 50 years since the last streetcar on June 19, 1954. The Northstar train service began on November 14, 2009. == Funding == Metro Transit gets funded by taxes and ride costs. Half of funding must come from riders. From 2001 to 2006, state taxes were lowered, raising the price of rides. The price of rides went up again by 25 cents in 2008. The price went up by 25 cents in 2017. === Prices === Some rides cost more during rush hour and busy days. A ride can cost $3.25 in rush hour, but only $2.50 during normal times. The Light Rail does not cost more during rush hour. Riders with disabilities (like wheelchairs) ride for only $1. The Go-To card was created in 2007. The card was made to pay for rides quicker. Only Northstar Train and Metro Mobility cost more for longer rides. == Rail system == === Light rail === The Blue Line started service on June 26, 2004. It is the first light rail line in Minnesota. The Blue Line ran from Hennepin Avenue station to Fort Snelling station. In December, it was extended to Mall of America through the Minneapolisâˆ’Saint Paul International Airport. In 2009, it was extended to Target Field. The Green Line started on June 14, 2014. It connects Downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota, the Saint Anthony Park, the State Capitol and Downtown St. Paul. In 2022, the Blue Line was closed for five weeks for track repairs. There are plans to extend both the Green Line and the Blue Line. === Northstar === The Northstar is a train system going from Minneapolis to Big Lake. The Northstar started on November 16, 2009.
