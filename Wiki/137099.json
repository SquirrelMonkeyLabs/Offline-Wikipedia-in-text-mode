 "text": "Nirvana is a greatest hits album by American grunge band Nirvana, who disbanded in 1994 because the lead singer, Kurt Cobain died. The album was released on October 29, 2002. It was almost not released because of a lawsuit by Cobain's wife Courtney Love. This was because of a song on the album, \"You Know You're Right\", that Love thought would be wasted on a box-set album. She thought it would work better on one CD. Soon after the lawsuit was settled, the album was released. ==List of songs== #\"You Know You're Right\" #\"About a Girl\" #\"Been a Son\" #\"Sliver\" #\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" #\"Come as You Are\" #\"Lithium\" #\"In Bloom\" #\"Heart-Shaped Box\" #\"Pennyroyal Tea\" #\"Rape Me\" #\"Dumb\" #\"All Apologies\" (live at MTV Unplugged) #\"The Man Who Sold the World\" (live at MTV Unplugged.
