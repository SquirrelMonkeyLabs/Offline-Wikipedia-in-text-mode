 "text": "Otto V the Victorious or the Magnanimous (1439 — 9 January 1471) was the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Prince of Lüneburg from 1457 until his death in 1471. He ruled with his older brother Bernard until Bernard's death in 1464. His father was Frederick II. 1464. Otto's reign was marked by the monastic reform movements of his time which he tried to implement in the Lüneburg monasteries. He entered Wienhausen Abbey, removed a number of art treasures which, in Otto's opinion were opposite to the ideal of monastic simplicity, and sent the abbess to be \"re-educated in a monastery that was already reformed.\"Geckler, Christa (1986).
