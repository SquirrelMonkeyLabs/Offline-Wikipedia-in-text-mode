 "text": "An ugli is a type of citrus fruit. It is related to the lemon. It started to grow quickly all across Jamaica over 80 years ago and was quickly discovered by the natives there. It became popularly known, but it did not have a name. The natives on Jamaica named it the ugli fruit because of its ugly appearance. It was shipped to the United States and South America on cargo ships and after it arrived in the Americas, its popularity only grew. The original fruit is believed to have been a hybrid formed from the Seville orange, the grapefruit, and the tangerine families. It is rich in vitamin C and other nutrients, low in calories, and contains powerful anti-inflammatory antioxidants called flavonoids. Most tangelos are free of furanocoumarins, which means they may be safe for those taking certain medications. Ugli fruit is a tasty way to enjoy the many benefits of citrus fruit. == Other websites == *Ugli(R) official web site *5 recipes with Ugli fruits *Health benefits from eating Ugli fruits Category:Citrus",
