 "text": "Rheobates is a group of frog species. They live in Colombia. These frogs have colors on their backs that make them hard to see. They have webbed skin on their feet. The name Rheobates comes from from the Greek words rheo for \"stream\" or \"current,\" and βάτης bátēs for \"a walker.\" Scientists named these frogs Rheobates because the type species Rheobates palmatus lives in streams. These frogs live near streams in forests in the smaller hills near the Andes mountains. ==Species== Scientists put two species in this group: * Rheobates palmatus (Werner, 1899) * Rheobates pseudopalmatus (Rivero and Serna, 2000) Not all scienitsts think that Rheobates pseudopalmatus is really a species. Not all scientists think Rheobates palmatus is really just one species: It might be a group of species instead of just one. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
