 "text": "The Felinae is a subfamily of the Felidae family. It includes small cats and a few medium-large cats, especially the cougar (Puma concolor) and the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). ==Genetic classification== There is now a precise classification for the living members of the subfamily based on genetic research.Wozencraft W.C. 2005. Order Carnivora. In Wilson, Don E. & Reeder, DeeAnn M. (eds) Mammal species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference. 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. 2 vols, 532â€“548 These genetic lineages have been identified:Johnson W.E. & O'Brien S.J. 1997.

Best known is the ocelot; also the guigna, margay, and Andean mountain cat *Lineage 3: Lynx *Lineage 4: Puma, Acinonyx (the cheetah) *Lineage 5: Prionailurus (spotted Asian wildcats), Otocolobus (Pallas's cat), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata), rusty-spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus), fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus), flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) *Lineage 6: Felis: the domestic cat and its nearest relatives. Widespread in Africa, Asia and Europe, notably the jungle cat, sand cat, and the wildcat.
