 "text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Kamala Harris, the junior U.S. senator from California, announced her candidacy on January 21, 2019. Harris has been discussed throughout 2018 and 2019 as a potential top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president. Harris was the fifth office-holding Democrat to formally announce a campaign in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, joining former Congressman John Delaney, former West Virginia State Sen. Richard Ojeda, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, and former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro. If elected, Harris would have become the first female and Asian American to ever become president of the United States. Harris was the third black woman to seek the Democratic nomination for president, the first two being Shirley Chisholm and Carol Moseley Braun. Her campaign headquarters were in Baltimore, Maryland, with a second office in Oakland, California. Harris ended her campaign on December 3, 2019 after falling low in poll numbers and campaign money raised. ==References== Harris Category:Kamala Harris",
