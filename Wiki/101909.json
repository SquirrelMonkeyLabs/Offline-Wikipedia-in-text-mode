 "text": "Protostomes are a nephrozoan taxon of animals above the level of phylum. It is not part of the normal system of classification. They are a subtaxon of the Bilateria, and are contrasted with the deuterostomes. Protosomes are distingued by their embryo: in deuterostomes, the first opening (the blastopore) becomes the anus, while in protostomes it becomes the mouth. DNA sequence analysis suggests that protostome animals can be divided into three major groups: *Ecdysozoa, e.g. arthropods, nematodes *Platyzoa, e.g. platyhelminthes, rotifers *Lophotrochozoa, e.g. molluscs, annelids as well as a number of minor taxa, like the Chaetognatha.
