 "text": "The Alaskan Klee Kai is a northern breed of dog of the spitz type. The term \"Klee Kai\" was derived from Alaskan Athabaskan (Eskimo) words meaning \"small dog\". The breed was developed to create a pet sized version of the Alaskan Husky, but it more closely resembles the Siberian Husky. This result makes it an energetic, intelligent, apartment-sized dog with an appearance that reflects its northern heritage. These dogs can come in a variety of different coat colors: black and white, gray and white, red and white and all white. They have a double coat, which means it is thicker. In 1997, the United Kennel Club recognized the Alaskan Klee Kai. It is a rare breed with not very many dogs. == References == == Other websites == * Dog Breed Info.com Category:Dog breeds originating in the United States Category:Rare dog breeds",
