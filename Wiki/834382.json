 "text": "If it is necessary to divide a space in two or more parts, this is done by movable walls. These consist of panels that are sometimes hung from overhead rails. The panels reduce transmission of sound. This is essential for preventing noise passing to nearby spaces. Together with active earmuffs, panels help keep the workplace or home noise from interfering with the kind of activities which require thought and attention. Applications include hotel function rooms, schools, conference centres, religious and sports facilities, business companies and private homes. In private homes they can help with some tricky problems, such as a family outgrowing the home, but not able to move to larger premises. == Portable partitions == Portable partitions are temporary walls used to divide rooms instead of permanent walls. They may be joined together section by section, or stand as one unit. Portable walls may be fixed, or on casters for rolling, while others may be folding room dividers. In Japanese homes and buildings, sliding panels called fusuma are widely used. Folding screens have been used in China for over two thousand years. == References == == Other websites == *National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health - Hearing Protector Device Compendium * \"Mallock-Armstrong Ear Defender\" a 1925 Flight article Category:Headgear Category:Buildings and structures by function Category:Sound",
