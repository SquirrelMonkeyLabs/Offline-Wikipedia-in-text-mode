The story begins with two polo players in Chitral trying to play polo better than each other: Jalal Begal, an ordinary man, and the ruler of Chitral, the Mehtar of Chitral. Jalal Begal often won the polo game against the Mehtar. The Mehtar got angry about losing, and he said that if he lost again, he would punish the people in his royal court. To stop this, the people in the court decided to kill Jalal Begal while he slept. The next day, Jalal Begal's mother found her son dead. Instead of crying or asking for help to bury him, she put on his polo clothes and got his horse ready for the polo game. She covered her face so no one could tell who she was. She went joined the polo team, and played the game. Her dead son's teammates thought she was Jalal Begal, and they thought he was playing polo better than they had ever seen him play before. They won against the ruler again. Then Nano Begal showed the ruler her face and she sang a song called Nano Begal-a: People still sing this song in the valleys in Chitral.
