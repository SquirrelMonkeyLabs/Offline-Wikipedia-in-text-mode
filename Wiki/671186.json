It has a blue shield with a gold trident. Ukraine adopted the small coat of arms on 19 February 1992. It is a part of the great coat of arms, as the Constitution of Ukraine says. But the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) has not approved it yet. The trident became a national symbol in 1917, when Mykhailo Hrushevskyi (a Ukrainian historian and politician) suggested it. On 25 February 1918, the Central Rada (parliament) adopted trident, and it became the coat of arms of the Ukrainian People's Republic. == Tryzub == Historians found the earlier symbols that is similar to trident.
