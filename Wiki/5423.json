 "text": "John Adams (October 30, 1735 â€“ July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, attorney, writer. He served as the second president of the United States from 1797 to 1801. Before becoming president, he was the first vice president under George Washington from 1789 to 1797. He was also the one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Adams was a leader of the American Revolution that gained independence from Great Britain. During the Revolutionary War, he served the U.S. government as a senior diplomat in Europe. == Early life == Adams was born in Braintree, Massachusetts. He was the son of Lt. Col. John Adams, Sr. (1691-1761) and Susanna Boylston (1708-1797), and he was the cousin of the philosopher and fellow Founding Father Samuel Adams. He went to Harvard College. He married Abigail Adams in 1764. == American Revolutionary War years == Adams wanted the Thirteen Colonies to be free from Great Britain. However, Adams was fair and thought every person should be treated fairly. Even though he did not want British soldiers in Boston, he was the lawyer who defended the British soldiers who were involved in the Boston Massacre. Adams was a representative from Massachusetts during the Second Continental Congress. He helped Thomas Jefferson write the United States Declaration of Independence. During the American Revolutionary War, Adams helped make peace with Great Britain. He served in France, the Netherlands and England as an ambassador in the 1780s. == Vice President == Adams was the first vice president under George Washington. After Washington chose not to run again, Adams won the 1796 election. Adams is thought to have been the first president to belong to a political party, but like George Washington, he thought himself above any particular party. He ran for president on the Federalist ticket. He beat Thomas Jefferson of the Democratic-Republican Party. President candidates and vice president candidates did not run together like they do today. Since Jefferson got the second-highest number of votes, he became vice president. == President == During his term, he resolved a conflict against France peacefully. He also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts which made it illegal to say bad things about the government. Many people did not like those acts because they felt it took away their freedom of speech. Adams was not re- elected president and lost to Thomas Jefferson. The Federalist Party was not as popular as it was when Adams was elected. One of his last acts as president was to make John Marshall the Chief Justice of the United States. This made sure that the Federalist Party would still be important. Of the first five U.S. presidents, Adams was the only one who did not own slaves. He was also the only one to be from New England. == Death== Adams died on July 4, 1826 of heart failure. This was the same day that Thomas Jefferson died, and was also exactly 50 years after the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. At 90, John Adams was the longest lived president of the United States until Ronald Reagan surpassed him in October 2001. John Adams was also a longest lived Vice President of the United States until Levi P. Morton surpassed him in 1915 and later by John Nance Garner in 1959. ==References== == Other websites == * John Adams' White House biography * John Adams -Citizendium Category:1735 births Category:1826 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom Category:Lawyers from Massachusetts Category:American revolutionaries Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Federalist Party politicians Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Politicians from Massachusetts Category:Presidents of the United States Category:Signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence Category:19th- century American politicians Category:18th-century American politicians Category:People from Quincy, Massachusetts Category:Ambassadors of the United States to the Netherlands Category:Vice presidents of the United States Category:19th-century presidents of the United States",
