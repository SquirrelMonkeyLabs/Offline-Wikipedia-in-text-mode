 "text": "Betty Dodson (August 24, 1929 - October 31, 2020) was an American sex educator and social critic. She was a part of the pro-sex feminist movement. She saw the modern feminist movement as needlessly political and hostile towards males. She is known for writing books about how masturbation is healthy and encouraged women to do it. In 1959, Dodson married Frederick Stern, an advertising director, with the marriage ending in divorce in 1965. She was openly bisexual. Dodson died of cirrhosis at her Manhattan apartment on October 31, 2020 at the age of 91. ==References== ==Other websites== * Betty Dodson with Carlin Ross. Better Orgasms.
