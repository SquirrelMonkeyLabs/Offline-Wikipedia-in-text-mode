It is entirely a reclaimed land occupied by Manila's South Harbor and Engineer Island, a dockyard known as the the Baseco Compound. It is bounded on the north by the Pasig River, facing the districts of Tondo and San Nicolas, on the west by the Manila Bay, on the east by Intramuros, separated by Radial Road 1, and on the south by the district of Ermita. Post-war developments at the Manila South Harbor eventually paved the way for the migration of natives from the different provinces, making it one of the largest ghettos in the Philippines. ==History== Port Area, historically known as Port District, was built on reclaimed land in the 1890s, toward the end of the Spanish rule in the Philippines, as an expansion of the port of Manila. In 1914, administrative oversight of the area was transferred to the Insular Collector of Customs (now, Bureau of Customs). Subsequently, in 1949, amendments to the City Charter of Manila resulted in the formal adoption of Port Area as part of a newly established legislative district. == Engineer Island == Engineer Island, an artificial island known as the Baseco Compound, was a dockyard in the Port Area. In 1966, families of Port Area's shipyard employees were resettled in Baseco by its owners, the Romualdez family â€” to make space for a prospective international seaport in the South Harbor. The compound was consequently sequestered after the 1986 People Power Revolution leading to its proclamation as a depressed residential area in 2002. == Gallery == File:Anda_Circle_(Port_Area,_Manila;_02-07-2021).jpg|Anda Circle, Port Area, Manila File:50Intramuros_Landmarks_Port_Area_Manila_01.jpg|Bonifacio Drive outside Intramuros, Port Area, Manila File:Manila_South_Harbor_Pier_15_(Port_Area,_Manila;_07-21-2024).jpg|Manila South Harbor, Pier 15 File:USS_Cowpens_Manila_2012.jpg|USS Cowpens (CG-63) Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser docked at Pier 15 File:Manila_South_Harbor,_Bureau_of_Customs_view_from_MH_(Port_Area_Manila;_07-20-2024).jpg|Manila South Harbor and Bureau of Customs Building File:Port_Area,_Manila_South_Harbor_30.jpg|Bureau of Quarantine == References== Category:Districts of Manila",
