 "text": "The Challenge () or Doctor's House Call is a 2023 Russian space docudrama movie by Klim Shipenko. The movie is the first time a professional actor has been filmed in space by a professional director, as other films before were filmed and acted in by astronauts/cosmonauts/space tourists (space tourists that were amateur both in film-making and as astronauts) or used footage from automated equipment. Apogee of Fear was written by a professional scriptwriter, and with some graphics assets done by a professional, but had no other filming professionals involved. and was theatrically released in Russia on 12 April 2023 by Central Partnership. Two television series accompanied the film: a 10-episode The Challenge. First in space () detailed the selection of the leading actress and the director/operator who would go to space, in elimination reality-show style, their subsequent training and travel; and The Challenge.

As the accompanying series stressed, this was a true collaboration between Russian movie and space industries, being not only an entertainment project, but also a leap in methodology for selection and training of cosmonauts that could get ready for flight in under 4 months despite lacking a technical education. This got tested when they had a situation in orbit, where the creative \"participants of the flight, not tourists!\" performed their right-seat and left-seat activities needed for manual docking to the ISS, assisting the central-seat professional pilot. According to filming plan, over 35 minutes of in-movie footage were shot directly in space (picked from about 70 hours filmed there overall), with just a few exterior shots using CGI. == Plot == Cosmonaut Ivanov (Oleg Bogdanov in original Russian version) loses consciousness while ISS must perform evasive maneuvers.
