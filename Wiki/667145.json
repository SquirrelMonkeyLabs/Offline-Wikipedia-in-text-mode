 "text": "Ulf Hjalmar Kristersson (born 29 December 1963) is a Swedish Moderate Party politician. In 2022, he became the Prime Minister of Sweden. He is the Leader of the Moderate Party since October 2017. He has been a Member of the Riksdag (MP) for Södermanland County since 2014. He also was the country's Minister for Social Security from 2010 to 2014 and Chairman of the Moderate Youth League from 1988 to 1992. From 2017 to 2022, he was the Leader of the Opposition. In September 2018, incumbent Prime Minister Stefan Löfven was ousted. Kristersson expressed hope of becoming the next PM. On 14 November, 2018 the Riksdag rejected Kristersson's bid to become the prime minister by a vote of 195 to 154. It first time ever that a speaker proposal for a prime minister lost such a vote. Since the 2018 election, the Moderate Party under his leadership opened up to the Sweden Democrats, and by late 2021 had formed an informal right-wing alliance with them and two centre-right parties of the dissolved Alliance. In the 2022 election, the right-wing bloc won a majority in the Riksdag, which caused Kristersson's election as Prime Minister on 17 October 2022. ==Related pages== *Adoptionscentrum ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Prime ministers of Sweden Category:Current national leaders",
