 "text": "Kika is a 1993 comedy movie. The title character gets involved in relationships with different men and is assaulted several times. One of these assaults is by a pornographic movie actor with a very low IQ. He assaults Kika with serious force and is then pulled from her by two unknown people. The movie originally received an NC-17 just before its release in the United States half a year after completion. The rating, though, was surrendered, and Kika was then released unrated. ==Sources== Category:1993 romantic comedy movies Category:Spanish comedy movies Category:Spanish romance movies Category:French comedy movies Category:French romance movies Category:Movies directed by Pedro Almod√≥var Category:Movies set in Madrid",
