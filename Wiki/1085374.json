 "text": "Tristichopteridae is a family of tetrapodomorphs from the Middle and Late Devonian. Some of them share some of the features of the elpistostegalians. The most well-known is probably Eusthenopteron. A classic notion is that Eusthenopteron was able to crawl onto land using its fins. However, no evidence believes this and is believed by many to be false. == Description == These fish were large, and some species could exceed three meters. The smallest forms (Tristichopterus) attained lengths of 30 cm, and the largest forms (Hyneria) could grow several meters long. The pelvis had long, tapering pubic branches that met in a cartilaginous symphysis. The ventral fins contained the femur, tibia, and fibula. The lobed pectoral fins were usually robust. Tristichopterids had large, flat heads with sharp teeth. == Taxonomy == * Cabonnichthys * Canningius * Edenopteron * Eusthenodon * Eusthenopteron * Heddleichthys * Hyneria * Jarvikina * Langlieria * Mandageria * Notorhizodon * Platycephalichthys * Tristichopterus == Some images == Here is a gallery of a few members of the Tristichopteridae: == References == * Thomson, K.
