Starting in 1976, he did figure-sculpting. His figures are special because they are all thick, which makes them look different from others. Botero was born in Medellín, Colombia. ==Death== Botero died from problems caused by pneumonia on 15 September 2023, at the age of 91 in Monte Carlo, Monaco. ==Gallery== File:Perrodebotero.jpg|Dog, Medellin File:Gatodebotero.jpg|Cat, Medellin File:Caballodebotero.jpg|Horse, Medellin File:Mujer con espejo-Botero.jpg|Woman with mirror, Madrid Image:'Man on Horse', bronze sculpture by Fernando Botero (Colombian), 1992, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Israel.JPG|Man on Horse, Jerusalem.
