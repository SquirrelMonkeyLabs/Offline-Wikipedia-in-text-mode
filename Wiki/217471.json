Many members also live in the diaspora. In total, the followers are estimated to be around 1 million people.Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa; Detroit: Thompson Gale, 2004; ; p. 82 The religion itself has elements of Shi'a Islam, Yazidi, and Alevism. Followers believe that their deity will be reincarnated seven times. The religion took the practice of Dhikr from Sufism. They also share common meals, and live together in a brotherly manner. Wladimir Fjodorowich Minorski was among the first to describe this religious community. ==References== Category:Religions Category:Kurdish organizations",
