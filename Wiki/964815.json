It includes the true or freshwater smelts and allies, such as the galaxiids and noodlefishes; they are also called osmeriforms. They belong to the teleost superorder Protacanthopterygii, which also includes pike and salmon etc. ==Naming== The order's name means \"smelt-shaped\", from Osmerus (the type genus) + the standard fish order suffix \"-formes\". It derives from Ancient Greek osmé (ὀσμή, \"pungent smell\") + Latin forma (\"external form\"), the former in reference to the characteristic aroma of the flesh of Osmerus. Category:Teleosts",
