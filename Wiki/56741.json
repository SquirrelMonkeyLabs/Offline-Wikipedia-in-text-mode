 "text": "Kraftwerk is a electronic band from Germany that became famous in the late 1970s and 1980s for making electronic music. They used synthesizers and sequencers to make the rhythms and melodies in the song. Kraftwerk made electronic music many years before other bands knew it would be popular. They paved the way for the MIDI and digital styles of music to become popular in the 1990s. Many of the sounds from songs such as \"Computer Love\", \"The Robots\", and \"Trans Europe Express\" can be heard sampled by a variety of bands on their current releases. Recently, some of Kraftwerk's original recording equipment was sold on eBay for astonishing amounts. Kraftwerk continues to have a faithful following. The band's name is German for power station. == Main discography == * 1970: Kraftwerk * 1972: Kraftwerk 2 * 1973: Ralf and Florian * 1974: Autobahn * 1975: Radio-Activity * 1977: Trans-Europe Express * 1978: The Man Machine * 1981: Computer World * 1983: Tour de France (single) * 1986: Electric Cafe * 1991: The Mix * 1999: Expo 2000 (single) * 2000: Expo Remix (single) * 2003: Tour de France Soundtracks * 2005: Minimum-Maximum (live album) * 2007: Aerodynamik/La Forme Remixes (single) Category:1970 establishments in Germany Category:1970s German music groups Category:1980s German music groups Category:1990s German music groups Category:2000s German music groups Category:2010s German music groups Category:DÃ¼sseldorf Category:Electronic music groups Category:German pop music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1970",
