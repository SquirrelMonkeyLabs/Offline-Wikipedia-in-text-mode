Ancient Cultures, Library of Congress Country Studies, Japan. ==History== Early evidence of Yayoi culture is found on the island of Kyūshū. Over time, it spread to the island of Honshū.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). \"Yayoi\" in Japan Encyclopedia, pp. 1051-1052. Iron and bronze were first used in Japan at about the same time. Iron was used for tools and weapons. Bronze was used for ritual objects such as mirrors, daggers and spears.British Museum, Dhoko (ritual spear blade) retrieved 2012-2-13. The Yayoi tools included as axes and hoes for agriculture etc., but also weapons such as arrowheads and swords. == Yayoi people == The Yayoi people (弥生人 Yayoi jin) were ancient people that migrated to the Japanese archipelago from southeastern China and Korea during the Yayoi period (300 BCE–300 CE). Modern Japanese people are direct descedants of the Yayoi and have about 97% Yayoi DNA. The Yayoi and the modern Japanese people are closely related to other East Asian (or Mongoloid) people, such as Chinese people or Koreans. They belonged to the haplogroup O and spoke the proto-Japonic languages. Most scientists and linguists suggest that they originated somewhere in southeastern China or Korea and migrated from there into Japan.崎谷満『DNA・考古・言語の学際研究が示す新・日本列島史』(勉誠出版 2009年)(in Japanese)Vovin, Alexander (2013). \"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\".
