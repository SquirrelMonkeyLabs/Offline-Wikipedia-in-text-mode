 "text": "The Treaty of Trianon was a peace agreement signed on June 4, 1920, and took effect on July 26, 1921. It ended the war between Hungary and most of the Allied Powers, which had started during World War I. The treaty was signed at the Grande Trianon Palace in Versailles and was one of several agreements made at the Paris Peace Conference. The treaty required Hungary and its neighbors—Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Austria—to recognize their common borders. Most of the Trianon treaty terms were changed or became irrelevant by the end of the interwar period. However, Hungary's borders set by the Trianon treaty were confirmed again by the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty. The Trianon treaty required Hungary to give up control of 70 percent of its pre-1914 territory. But in reality, the Hungarian government in Budapest had lost control of most of these areas by late 1918 to mid-1919. The only region Hungary actually had to give up after the treaty was Burgenland, which went to Austria in late 1921. On the other hand, the treaty allowed Hungary to regain some control over certain areas. Before the treaty was signed, the Romanian army left the left bank of the Tisza River, and in August 1921, Hungarian forces took back the mining areas of Pecs after Serbian troops withdrew. The treaty also required Hungary to pay reparations and limited its military, but it provided trade benefits with Austria and Czechoslovakia, coal supplies from Czechoslovakia and Poland, and legal protection for Hungarian property and citizens abroad. The partition brought irredentism, since many people in the lost lands were Hungarian and wanted to continue being part of Hungary. Hundreds of thousands of people from the lost territories sought refuge in Hungary.
