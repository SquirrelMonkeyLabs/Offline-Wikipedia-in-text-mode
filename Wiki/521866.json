He moved to London in 1994. He was thought to be the person seen in several videos produced by the militant group ISIL. The videos showed the beheadings of captives in 2014 and 2015. A group of his hostages nicknamed him \"Jihadi John\" since he was part of a four-person terrorist cell with British accents whom they called \"The Beatles\". On the night of 12 November 2015, US officials reported that Emwazi had been hit by a drone strike in Al-Raqqah, Syria. The following day, UK officials stated a “high degree of certainty” that Emwazi was killed. He was declared dead later that day. ==References== Category:1988 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Deaths by airstrike Category:British Muslims Category:Criminals from London Category:Islamic State people Category:Kuwaiti people Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom",
