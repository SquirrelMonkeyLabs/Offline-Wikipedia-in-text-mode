 "text": "Democratic Kampuchea was the official name of Cambodia, or Kampuchea, from 1976 to January 1979. Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge ruled the country. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 and took over the government, Democratic Kampuchea became the People's Republic of Kampuchea. ==Cambodian genocide== As many as 3,000,000 Cambodians ( of the Cambodian population) died in the Cambodian genocide ( / ) committed by Democratic Kampuchea's Khmer Rouge regime. This was around 25% of the population: one in every four people. ===Killing fields=== The Khmer Rouge massacred at least hundreds of thousands of people in the \"killing fields,\" and buried them in mass graves to destroy evidence that could be used for proving their genocide.Khmer Rouge leader admits crimes They also forced city populations into the countryside to work in labor camps, where many died from starvation, overwork, and disease. ==End== In January 1979, communist Vietnam invaded Cambodia. They wanted to oust Pol Pot from power as his army had crossed the Cambodian–Vietnamese border to massacred Vietnamese civilians. They removed the Khmer Rouge from power and propped up another pro-Vietnamese communist dictatorship, which was not recognized by many UN members. Hundreds of thousands of survivors fled to refugee camps in Thailand,Caldwell, Malcolm. 1975. \"Cambodia: Rationale for a Rural Policy.\" pp. 26–103 in Malcolm Caldwell’s South East Asia, edited by B. Hering and E. Utrecht. Townsville, Australia: Committee of South-East Asian Studies, James Cook University of North Queensland. Many of whom immigrated to the United States afterwards. ===Trials=== In 2006, the United Nations and the Cambodian government established a special court called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). This court has tried some former Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity. Kaing Guek Eav – also known as Comrade Duch – was the first to be tried before the ECCC. Eav was the head of Security Prison 21 during the genocide. The court found him guilty of crimes against humanity and breaking the Geneva Conventions of 1949. He was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2011, the ECCC convicted two top Khmer Rouge officials, Noun Chea and Khieu Samphan, for crimes against humanity, genocide, and breaking the Geneva Conventions. ==Cambodian genocide denial== ===Academia=== On the debate about the Cambodian genocide, American political scientist Donald W. Beachler remarked,Beachler, Donald W. (2009) \"Arguing about Cambodia: Genocide and Political Interest\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies 23(2):214–38. Despite the abundance of verified testimonies from Cambodian refugees and foreign witnesses, Cambodian genocide denial within academia was widespread in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia etc. ====Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman==== With the transnational academic-cultural network tied to their prominence in Western academia, American scholars Noam Chomsky (1928 – ) and Edward S. Herman (1925 – 2017) published several books discrediting the survivors, objecting to the genocide classification and the confirmed death toll of the Cambodian genocide, * * * * which influenced hundreds of millions worldwide into doing the same. ====Gareth Porter==== In 1976, American historian Gareth Porter (1942 – ) co-authored the book Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution with George Hildebrand in which he denied that one million Cambodians had already been killed by the Khmer Rouge. On May 3, 1977, Porter repeated his denial at the Solarz hearing in the U.S. Congress.Human Rights in Cambodia.\" Hearing Before the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, 95th Congress, 1st Session. 1977 May 3. Also available via Google Books. Historians have been critical of Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution. Particularly, Particularly, historian Bruce Sharp researched the citations of that book. Of the 50 citations in a chapter of that book, 33 were traced to Khmer Rouge state propaganda, while 6 from that of the CCP, which served as a proof of their confirmation bias and intellectual dishonesty. Recalling the encounter later in his life, Solarz called Porter's Cambodian genocide denial \"cowardly and contemptible,\" comparing him to those who denied the Holocaust.Thompson, Larry Clinton. 2010. Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975–1982. Jefferson, NC: MacFarland. ====Samir Amin==== Egyptian-French economist Samir Amin had been a good friend of Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan since they were studying in France in the Cold War's early years. When the Cambodian genocide was exposed, Amin continued to hail the Khmer Rouge as the most superior communist model. When asked again about the Cambodian genocide in 1986, Amin retorted with an inversion of reality by blaming the \"American imperialists,\" Vietnamese communists and Lon Nol for the suffering of the Cambodians. ===Responses=== ====François Ponchaud==== François Ponchaud (1939 – ) is a French priest who lived in Cambodia during the genocide. As a witness, he documented the genocide in his book Cambodge Année Zéro (Cambodia: Year Zero), which attracted biased criticism from Noam Chomsky and Gareth Porter who denied the genocide. In response, Ponchaud called out their intellectual dishonesty: ====Sophal Ear==== Cambodian-American historian Sophal Ear satirically referred to the biased narrative of pro-Khmer Rouge Western academic leftists as the Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia (STAV), ====William Shawcross==== British journalist William Shawcross criticized the STAV academics as well. His criticism was endorsed by human rights activist David Hawk who pointed out that ====Jakob Guhl==== Jakob Guhl, the Senior Manager, Policy and Research of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said that Cambodian genocide denial among Western academic leftists was rooted in their dogmatic rejection of liberal democracy, presumption of \"moral superiority\" of anti-capitalist regimes and division of political actors into binary categories (oppressors vs. oppressed) to justify \"anti-hierarchical aggression\" towards hypothetical oppressors, who are dehumanized to have their suffering denied. ==References== Category:Former dictatorships Category:Cambodian genocide Category:Former socialist republics Category:1976 establishments in Asia Category:1979 disestablishments in Asia Category:Former countries in Southeast Asia",
