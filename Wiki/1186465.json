 "text": "Pre-Spanish Era1 La Trinidad was well-cultivated with rice, sweet potatoes, gabi, and sugar cane by its original settlers. The natives of La Trinidad were generally Ibaloys who trace their ancestry to the Kalanguya Tribe (forest people) of Tinek, Ifugao, who, due to the need to survive in a less hostile environment in different waves and paths of migration, followed mountain ranges or the course of rivers and then finding a suitable environment, usually along the river, or an open clearing, settled in Kabayan, Itogon, Tuba, Atok, Kafagway (Baguio) and La Trinidad. Finding earlier settlers in those areas these travellers then mingled with the former and through intermarriage, settled among them. They maintained swidden farms along the hillsides, carved rice terraces along the mountain slopes along rivers, creeks and streams and rice fields in the marshy valley. The villagers’ pasturelands or estancia were located in the hillsides where herds of cattle and horses grazed. In their backyards, the natives domesticated animals such as pigs, chicken and dogs. As the Cordilleras was mainly left undiscovered by the Spanish colonizers, small settlements in the area were found by the Spaniards. Highest in the social strata are the wealthy or bacnang and the mambunong (local priest). Wealth was measured by ownership of land and cattle where redistribution of wealth was done by holding prestigious feasts or peshit. Religion was based on the belief in a supreme being called the Kabunian. Prayers were done during rituals and festivities. Rituals were based largely on agriculture. Cañaos or festivities were accompanied by chants (ba-dew) and dance with the gongs (gansa) and drums (solibao) as the basic musical instruments.",
