 "text": "On 7 January 2019, the Armed Forces of Gabon announced a coup d'état in Gabon. Military officers claimed that they had removed President Ali Bongo. Bongo became president in 2016 after a disputed election and protests. Ali Bongo was receiving medical treatment in Morocco. While he was there, armed rebels in the capital city Libreville acted. They took hostages. They said that they had created a \"National Restoration Council\" to \"restore democracy in Gabon.\" During this time, the Internet was sometimes not available. It is unknown if the Internet was shut down by the rebels themselves or by civilians. Gabon's government later said that it had gotten control again. ==References== Category:2019 in Africa Category:21st century in Gabon Category:January 2019 events",
