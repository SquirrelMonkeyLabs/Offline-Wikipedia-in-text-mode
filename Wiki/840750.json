The stadium opened in 1995 as Jacksonville Municipal Stadium on the site of the old Gator Bowl Stadium (erected 1927), and included some portions of the older stadium. Located on the St. Johnâ€™s River, it sits on 10 acres of land in Downtown Jacksonville. The stadium would be called Alltel Stadium from 1997 until 2006, EverBank Field from 2010 until 2018, and TIAA Bank Field until 2018 until 2023. On June 23, 2023, the Jaguars announced that the stadium would be renamed as EverBank Stadium. The stadium is also used as the headquarters for the professional wrestling companies All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and Ring of Honor (ROH), both of which are also owned by Jaguars senior president of football Tony Khan. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:National Football League venues Category:Sports buildings in Florida",
