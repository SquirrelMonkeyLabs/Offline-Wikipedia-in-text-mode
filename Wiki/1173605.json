 "text": "The Trinidad poison frog (Mannophryne trinitatis) is a frog, it lives in Trinidad. ==Home== The adult frogs live on the ground in dark forests near clear, narrow streams where the water moves slowly. Scientists saw the frog between 0 and 500 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in a protected parks, the Matura Forest Reserve . ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground or on rocks. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. The adults take the tadpoles to different places depending on which animals that would eat the tadpoles are nearby. Most of them choose deep stream pools or pools of water near tree roots. In some places, for example Tamana, the frogs carry tadpoles to ponds inside caves. Sometimes the tadpoles eat each other. Other times, they eat insects that eat bat waste. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in not danger of dying out because there is so much forest in Trinidad. Some of the forest was cut down and is growing back and some of it was never cut down. The forests connect to each other, so frogs can go from place to place without having to cross open spaces in between. Scientists checked the frogs for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the fungus that causes the disease chytridiomycosis, and they do not think the fungus will kill many of these frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
