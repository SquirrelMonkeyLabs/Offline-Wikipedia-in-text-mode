 "text": "Michael Andrew Atherton (born 23 March 1968) is a broadcaster, journalist and a former England international cricketer. A right-handed opening batsman for Lancashire and England, and occasional leg-break bowler, he achieved the captaincy of England at the age of 25 and led the side in a then record 54 Test matches. Known for his stubborn resistance during an era of hostile fast bowling, Atherton was described in 2001 as a determined defensive opener who made \"batting look like trench warfare\". He had several famed bouts with bowlers including South Africa's Allan Donald and Australia's Glenn McGrath. Atherton often played the anchor role at a time when England batting performances lacked consistency. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * * Atherton's personal website Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:English and Welsh cricketers Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People with ankylosing spondylitis",
