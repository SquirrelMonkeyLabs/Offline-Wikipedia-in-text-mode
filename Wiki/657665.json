 "text": "The Money in the Bank ladder match is a multi-person ladder match held by the professional wrestling promotion WWE. First contested at WWE's annual WrestleMania event beginning in 2005, a separate Money in the Bank pay-per- view was created in 2010. The winner of the match gets a contract that they can use anytime to get a match for a championship of their choosing within the next 12 months. Originally the winners could only cash in on their brand's world/women's championship. This restriction was removed in 2022. A women's variation exists since 2017. == History == In WWE storyline, the concept for the Money in the Bank match was introduced in March 2005 by Chris Jericho. Jericho then pitched the idea to Raw general manager Eric Bischoff, who liked it and promptly began to book the match for WrestleMania 21. Edge won the first match and held the contract until New Year's Revolution in January 2006. There, he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract against WWE Champion John Cena, who had just successfully defended the title in an Elimination Chamber match. Edge defeated Cena to become WWE Champion and quickly establishing the precedent of \"cashing in\" on a vulnerable champion. The 2017 Money in the Bank pay-per-view took place on June 18 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri as a SmackDown-exclusive event, this was the only single-branded Money on the Bank event. It also featured the first women's Money in the Bank match, which was won by Carmella. == Matches == Raw brand SmackDown brand Year Event Prize Winner Other competitors Time 2005 WrestleMania 21 World Heavyweight Championship match Edge Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Shelton Benjamin, Kane and Christian 15:17 * In the 2005 WWE draft, World Heavyweight Champion Batista was drafted to SmackDown and WWE Champion John Cena was drafted to Raw, thus enabling Edge to challenge for the WWE Championship instead. \"Y2J had an idea.
