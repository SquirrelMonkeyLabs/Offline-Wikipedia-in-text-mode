 "text": "Fabrice \"Fab\" Morvan (born 14 May 1966) is a French singer-songwriter, dancer and model. He was half of pop duo Milli Vanilli, with Rob Pilatus. The duo sold multi-platinum albums around the world. But in the early 1990s, he and Pilatus were involved in one of the largest scandals in the history of pop music. It was revealed that neither he nor Pilatus really sang on any of Milli Vanilli's music whatsoever, but were lip synching. After the scandal, the duo got themselves back together as Rob & Fab, though with limited success. Pilatus died of an overdose in 1998. Morvan had a solo comeback in the 2000s, with his album Love Revolution. Morvan was born in Paris, France. ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Models from Paris Category:French pop singers Category:Musicians from Paris Category:French singer-songwriters Category:Singers from Paris Category:Writers from Paris",
