 "text": "Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati (6 April 1901 â€“ 4 July 1925) was an Italian Roman Catholic social activist. He was born in Turin. He was a member from the Third Order of Saint Dominic. He was dedicated to social justice issues. He helped the poor and less fortunate living in his hometown of Turin. He died in Turin on 4 July 1925 from polio, aged 24. His cause for canonization opened in 1932 after the Turin poor made several pleas for such a cause to open. However, Pope Pius XII suspended the cause in 1941. Pope John Paul II beatified Frassati in mid-1990 and dubbed him the \"Man of the Eight Beatitudes\". ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Infectious disease deaths in Italy Category:Deaths from poliomyelitis Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:People from Turin Category:Beatified people",
