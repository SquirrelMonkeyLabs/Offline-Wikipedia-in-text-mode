 "text": "French Americans (French: Américain français), also called Franco-Americans (French: Franco-Américains) are Americans who identify themselves to be of French or French Canadian descent. About 11.8 million U.S. residents are of French or French Canadian descent. About 2 million speak French at home. An additional 750,000 U.S. residents speak a French-based creole language, according to the 2011 census. Americans of French descent make up a substantial percentage of the American population. However French Americans are less visible than other similarly sized ethnic groups. This is due in part to the high degree of assimilation among Huguenot (French Protestant) settlers. Also, there is a tendency of French American groups to identify more strongly with \"New World\" regional identities. These include Québécois, French Canadian, Acadian, Cajun, or Louisiana Creole. This has prevented the development of a wider French American identity. == References == == Other websites== * Extensive studies, Documents, Statistics and Resources of Franco American History * Franco American Women's Institute * Institut français * Dave Martucci, Franco-American flags, in Flags of the World *Vivre en Orange County - French Community in Orange County, California *Bonjour L.A. !- Bonjour L.A. !
