The members of the alliance include AITO (Seres Group), Luxeed (Chery), BAIC BluePark (Stelato), and JAC Motors. == History == ===Beginning=== After technological cooperation with Arcfox and Seres, at the end of 2021, Huawei entered the automotive industry for the first time as a co-founder of a new car company. Together with the then Sokon Group, joint-venture Aito Auto was established, focused on the production of electrified SUVs with technology provided by Huawei. After great market success and a year and a half of presence on the market, in June 2023 Huawei decided to take over the remaining 50% of shares in Aito and become the full owner of the company. In the middle of the same year, Huawei established a technological partnership with another Chinese company, Chery to launch a second brand of electric cars - this time Luxeed. ===The rise of HIMA=== The acquisition of Aito and the creation of the Luxeed brand was the basis for the announcement in November 2023 of the establishment of a branch of the Huawei concern intended strictly for the development and establishing cooperation with various Chinese automotive companies. Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, abbreviated as 'HIMA', began its operations with strategic cooperation agreements to provide technology and production capacity with various entities. In addition to Seres Group and Chery, HIMA's collaborators also include BAIC Group and JAC Motors. The first of them became a contractor for the production of the S9 model of the third brand Stelato, which was launched in March 2024. == Alliance brands == === AITO === AITO () is the brand used for Huawei's collaboration with Seres Group.
