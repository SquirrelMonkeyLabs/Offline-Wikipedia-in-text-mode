The Ra class were a more slender and improved version of the standard R class, they were built by English Electric of Rocklea, Brisbane, Queensland from 1968 to 1974. They weren't fitted with dynamic brakes, unlike the R class, both were withdrawn in 1991, with all but the Ka (standard gauge) conversions being scrapped. No. 1918 was converted to Ka class No. 213, but later reconverted to an Ra class, and is now preserved and displayed at the Bassendean Railway Museum.
