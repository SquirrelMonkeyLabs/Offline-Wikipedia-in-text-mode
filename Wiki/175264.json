 "text": "The Alhambra (from Arabic = Al-Ħamrā', literally \"the red fort\"; the complete name was = al-Qal'at al-Ħamrā' = \"the red fortress\") is a palace and fortress complex of the Moorish rulers of Granada in southern Spain (known as Al- Andalus when the fortress was constructed during the mid 14th century), occupying a hilly terrace on the southeastern border of the city of Granada. == History == In the Middle Ages the Alhambra was the residence of the Muslim rulers of Granada and their court, now it is one of Spain's major tourist attractions. There one can see the most famous Islamic Architecture of the country. Within the Alhambra, the Palace of Charles V was erected by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1527. The Muslim rulers lost Granada and Alhambra in 1492 without the fortress itself being attacked when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile took the surrounding region with an overwhelming force of numbers. == Media == Image:Patio Paleis Karel V.jpg|Patio of the palace of Charles V Image:Panorámica Alhambra y Sierra Nevada de fondo.jpg|Panoramic view Image:Alambra_night_thierry_brouard.jpg|Panoramic view, illuminated at night Image:Honeycomb_work.jpg|Mocárabes or honeycomb works Image:Granada Alhambra Fuente de los leones.jpg|Lions Fontain Image:Spain Andalusia Granada BW 2015-10-25 17-28-47.jpg|Court of the Lions Image:Alhambra Löwenhof 7.JPG|Court of the Lions Image:Palacio Nazaries, Alhambra, Granada.jpg|Detail looking up wall, Golden Room patio Image:Alhambra de noche.JPG|Alhambra illuminated at night Image:Spain Andalusia Granada BW 2015-10-25 17-47-40 1.jpg|The pool of the El Partal Palace Image:court of lions in Palacio Nazaries.jpg|Light effects in the Court of Lions Image:Palacio de Comares.jpg|Guests in the Comares Palace Image:Alhambra wall detail.jpg|Detail of a wall of the palacios nazaries Image:Alhambra.1.ogv|Video walkthrough of the Alhambra - part 1 Image:Alhambra.2.ogg|Video walkthrough of the Alhambra - part 2 Image:Alhambra.3.ogg|Video walkthrough of the Alhambra - part 3 ==Other reading sources== * * * * * Grabar, Oleg.
