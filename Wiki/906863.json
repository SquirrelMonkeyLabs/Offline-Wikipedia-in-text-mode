 "text": "Karnaaj Rally is a racing and vehicular combat game. It came out on the Game Boy Advance in 2003, and as K-Rally on Symbian and Windows Mobile in 2006. ==Gameplay== Karnaaj Rally has a top-down perspective. The player is a sponsored racer, and can make bets, buy armor, upgrade their engine or tires and stay the best by winning races. Races come in seasons. The last race happens on the Moon. ==Reception== Karnaaj Rally was mostly liked. It is rated 80% on GameRankings, 81 out of 100 on Metacritic with 9 reviews, 8.8 \"Great\" on IGN. and 7.8/10 \"good\" on GameSpot, which called it \"a blast to play\" and the best Game Boy Advance game of January 2003. Many video game reviewers and publications hated the game's box art. 1UP.com's feature \"Hey Covers... You Suck!\" said it has \"..the world's ugliest man jump[ing] in front of the camera.\" IGN liked the game, but said it is \"hard to ignore the crappy name and awful package design\" and to \"Never judge a book by its cover.\" Readers of the June 2003 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly (issue 167) and makers of the game hated it when Seanbaby hated the game because its cover art was bad. ==References== Category:2002 video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Vehicular combat games",
