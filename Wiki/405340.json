 "text": "Saint Aloysius Gonzaga (9 March 1568 - 21 June 1591) was born in the family's castle of Castiglione delle Stiviere in Italy and died at 23 while in training to be a Jesuit. He is a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1576, at the age of eight, he was sent to Florence with his brother at the court of the Duke of Florence. After leaving Florence he met St. Charles Borromeo and from him received First Communion. After a period at the court in Spain he returned to Italy and he renounced his heritage in favor of his brother. Though in delicate health, he cared for those suffering from an epidemic in Rome, hence his early death. He was beatified in 1605 and made saint in 1726. The feast day is celebrated on June 21. == References == ==Other websites== *Catholic online profile Category:1568 births Category:1591 deaths Category:Christian saints Category:House of Gonzaga",
