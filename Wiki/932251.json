 "text": "Eviction is the process of forcing a tenant or homeowner to move out of a property, In the United States, this is usually for failure to pay rent, mortgage or property taxes, (the latter two resulting from foreclosure) or for breaking the rules the landlord, homeowners association or municipality has enacted upon said property. Eviction can take a long time. Lots of reasons throughout history have been given for evictions, such as when the United States Government evicted Native Americans from their original lands with little or no compensation,National Geographic Society (2023). The United States Governmentâ€™s Relationship with Native Americans. Retrieved from (https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/united-states-governments- relationship-native-americans/) All over the world indigenous people were evicted in similar ways in what we call colonialism. We call this forced eviction, and the people who were evicted as dispossessed. Today this is considered a violation of Human Rights Amnesty International UK (2024). Stop Forced Evictions.
