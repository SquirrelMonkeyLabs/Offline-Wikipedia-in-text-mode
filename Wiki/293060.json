 "text": "Mobile genetic elements (MGE) are a type of DNA that can move around within the genome. They include: *Transposons (also called transposable elements) **Retrotransposons **DNA transposons **Integrons **Insertion sequences *Plasmids *Bacteriophage elements, like Mu which integrates randomly into the genome *Group II introns The total of all mobile genetic elements in a genome may be referred to as the mobilome. Barbara McClintock was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements\". ==Related pages== * Horizontal gene transfer ==References== *Miller W.J. and Capy P.
