 "text": "In number theory, the radical of an integer is the product of its unique prime factors. The radical of an integer n is written \\mathrm{rad}\\, n. The radical is an important part of the abc conjecture, one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. == Definition == In mathematical notation, the radical of an integer x is given by \\mathrm{rad}\\, n = \\prod_{p\\mid n\\in \\mathbb{P}} p This can be read in plain language as \"the product of all prime numbers p that evenly divide n\". == Examples == The radicals of the first positive integers are : 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 10, 11, 6, 13, 14, 15, 2, 17, 6, 19, 10, 21, 22, 23, 6, 5, 26, 3, 14, 29, 30, 31, 2, 33, 34, 35, 6, 37, 38, 39, 10, 41, 42, 43, 22, 15, 46, 47, 6, 7, 10, ... . == Properties == The radical of a number is the largest square-free factor of that number. n = \\mathrm{rad}\\, n if and only if n is square-free. For any two integers a and b, :\\mathrm{rad}\\, ab = \\frac{(\\mathrm{rad}\\, a)(\\mathrm{rad}\\, b)}{\\mathrm{rad}\\,(\\gcd(a,b))} It follows from this that the radical is an incompletely multiplicative function. In ring theory, \\mathrm{rad}\\, n is the greatest common divisor of the nilpotent elements of the ring of integers modulo n. == Sources ==",
