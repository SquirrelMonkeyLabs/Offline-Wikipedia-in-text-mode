 "text": "Prometheus is a Titan in Greek mythology. He is the son of Iapetus and Clymene. He created humans, originally made out of gold. He also stole fire from Zeus and gave it to humans. As punishment, Zeus had Prometheus chained to a mountain. Every day an eagle (symbol of Zeus) would come and eat his liver. Prometheus is immortal, so he never died, and his liver grew back every night. But he still felt great pain. After a long time, Zeus sent his son Heracles to free Prometheus by breaking the chains which held him. Aeschylus wrote a play about Prometheus. ==Gallery== Image:Gustave Moreau 006.jpg|Prometheus by Gustave Moreau, (1868).
