It lies in the Puna de Atacama, a region of very high volcanic peaks on a high plateau within the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world. == History == The first recorded ascent was on 1 December 1952, by Bión González and Juan Harseim, from Chile. They found archaeological evidence that people were at the top of Llullaillaco in the pre-Columbian period. During 1983–1985, American archaeologist Johan Reinhard directed three surveys of archaeological sites on the summit and slopes of the mountain. The summit is the highest archaeological site in the world. The mummies of three Inca children were found on it in 1999. These were found by Johan Reinhard and Constanza Ceruti and their expedition. Other artifacts were also found along with the mummies. It is believed that the children were part of a human sacrifice. == Geography == The volcano is in the Chile-Argentina boder and is part, on the Chilean part, of the Llullaillaco National Park ().
