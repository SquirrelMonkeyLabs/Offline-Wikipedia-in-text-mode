Sutherland, and Dan Jolley). The series is about the adventures of wild cats as they try to survive in their forest homes. The cats call themselves warriors. The series is made up of nine mini-series with six books in each series. Seven field guides were also released. They give more information about the cats and their history. Seventeen \"Super Edition\" books have been released, with one more announced to be released in 2025. These books are double the length of the normal books. Seventeen manga books have been released. These are comics that tell short stories not seen in the main books. There have also been many short stories. The series focuses on five groups of cats that live in Clans, and their lives. They live by a set of rules called the warrior code. Each mini-series focuses on different characters. ==Setting and characters== The first mini-series centers around Rusty, a kittypet (housecat) who joins ThunderClan, and eventually becomes leader of it. The second mini-series focuses on the cats finding a new home after their old home was destroyed by Twolegs (humans). The third mini-series focuses on several cats who were born with special powers. The fourth mini-series focuses on two sisters, who work together to fight the ghosts of evil cats. The fifth mini- series shows how the Clans were created.

The cats live in five groups called Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, ShadowClan, and SkyClan. When Clan cats die, they go to StarClan (Heaven) or the Dark Forest/Place of No Stars (Hell). The first mini-series, the first two books of the second mini-series, and the fifth mini-series are set in a forest that the authors have said was based on the New Forest area of England.\"Transcript Of Erin Hunter Chat\".

The cats have a system of leadership that uses multiple role titles. The highest position is the Clan leader, and their assistant is called the deputy. The cats who heal the Clan with special plants are called medicine cats. Normal Clan cats are called warriors. Young cats in training to become a warrior or a medicine cat are called apprentices. Kittens are called kits. Old cats who have retired from their jobs are called elders.
