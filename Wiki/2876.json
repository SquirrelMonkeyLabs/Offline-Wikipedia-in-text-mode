 "text": "A carnivore is an animal, or less commonly a plant, which eats only meat. The word Carnivora comes from Latin, where carne means \"flesh\" or \"meat\", and vorare is a verb meaning \"eat\", that is \"meat-eater\". Predators commonly hunt and kill their own prey. Scavengers are carnivores which eat animals they did not kill themselves. Carnivores which eat mainly or only insects are called insectivores. Carnivores which eat mainly or only fish are called piscivores. The word \"carnivore\" describes more than just the scientific order Carnivora. However, almost all animals in the Carnivora do eat meat, though a few, for example pandas, do not.Ullrey, Duane E. Nutrient requirements: carnivores.
