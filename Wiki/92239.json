There can be multiple piercings and it is possible to change rings, depending on how you pierce it. This piercing can be done at any angle where there is a clear flap of skin, but the most common navel piercing is through the upper rim of the navel. Healing usually takes around 6–12 months, but is different for each person due to differences in their body. ==Gallery== File:My navel piercing.png|A navel piercing File:עגיל בתבור.jpg|A navel piercing with white closures File:Caribicbauch02.jpg|A navel piercing with several pieces of jewelry attached File:Double navel piercing.png|A double navel piercing File:Nude in Public 08117.jpg|A navel piercing with a chain attached == Related pages == * Nipple piercing * Genital piercing * Jewellery ==References== Category:Body piercing Category:Jewelry",
