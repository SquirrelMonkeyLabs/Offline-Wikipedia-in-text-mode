 "text": "Cholecystitis is when the gallbladder gets inflamed. If it is not treated, cholecystitis can become life-threatening, such as if it results in one's gallbladder rupturing. Treating cholecystitis often involves removing the gallbladder. ==Notable cases== After his assassination, U.S. President James A. Garfield might have had a case of cholecystitis that resulted in his condition becoming worse starting from late July 1881. The reason for this might have been that President Garfield's doctors might have accidentally injured and created a hole in his bladder while they were searching his body for his assassin Charles Guiteau's bullet. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the digestive system Category:Inflammation",
