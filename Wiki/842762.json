It is thought to be the first prime-time documentary specifically designed for a female audience. The program showed Mrs. Kennedy on a tour of the house with CBS News correspondent Charles Collingwood. The videotaped tour was the first view of the White House to the American public. The broadcast was seen by more than eighty million viewers and syndicated globally to 50 countries, including China and the Soviet Union. ==References== Category:John F.
