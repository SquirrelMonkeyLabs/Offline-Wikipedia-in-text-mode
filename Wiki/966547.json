Novorossiysk went to Russia in 1829 because of the Russo-Turkish War. It became a major base for the Black Sea Fleet. During the 19th century, Novorossiysk developed quickly. It was given city status in 1866. It became the capital of the Novorossiysky Okrug and Black Sea Governorate. In December 1905, the city was the capital of the short-lived Novorossiysk Republic. The city was used as the main center of Denikin's White Army from 26 August 1918 until 27 March 1920 during the Russian Civil War. Denikin's South Russian Government was moved to Crimea.
