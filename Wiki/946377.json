Irrespective of the shared language of instruction, Heidelberg is the oldest university in modern Germany. At the beginning, there were only the four traditional faculties. In 1890, the natural science got their own faculty. Later after a re-organisation, the university has 12 faculties. The University of Heidelberg is also known as Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, after the German prince Rupert I. == References == Category:1380s establishments Heidelberg Category:Heidelberg",
