 "text": "The Wolff–Kishner reduction is an organic process of reducing carbonyl groups; usually ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. It is carried out in presence of solvent to speed up reaction. It is carried out in basic medium. Thus, it can not be used for base sensitive reagents. It is named after by Nikolai Kischner and Ludwig Wolff. Category:Organic reactions Category:Name reactions",
