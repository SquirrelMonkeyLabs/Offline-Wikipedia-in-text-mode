 "text": "Frisian handball (Dutch: kaatsen, Frisian: Keatsen) is a traditional Frisian sport, related to American handball and fives, that is most commonly practiced by people from the northern province of Frysl√¢n, or Friesland. It is believed to be one of the oldest ballgames. The score is similar to tennis. The first team that scores six games, wins the match. It is played by the ethnic group of the Frisians. In parts of Belgium, a similar game is played, there called Jeu de Pelote. This game is played by teams of 5 players on a trapezium shaped field, mostly on marketplaces. == Other websites == * Belgian Federation * KNKB Dutch Federation * Walon amateur Federation * Franeker's Permanent Comity * Ath Handball Museum * 1956, Balle Pelote final match, Braine-Gosseli * Video: Chris Wassenaar Category:Handball Category:Frisian culture",
