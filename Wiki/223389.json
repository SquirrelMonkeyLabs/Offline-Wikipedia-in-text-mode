In the time of the 7th to the 9th century new places to live got name endings like -hausen. In 836 the name of Eppertshausen was written down in a document for the first time. It was owned by the monastery of the nearby city of Seligenstadt. Formerly the people in Eppertshausen were mostly farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the Rhine-Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working, leather manufacturing and chemical processing. Many men became workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly. == Twinned cities == * Chaource, France * Codigoro, Italy == References == == Other websites == * Official website of Eppertshausen Category:Municipalities in Hesse",
