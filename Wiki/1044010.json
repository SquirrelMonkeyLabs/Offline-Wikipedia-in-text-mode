 "text": "Uniting for Consensus (UfC), also known as the Coffee Club, is a group that was created in the 1990s against the possible expansion of Permanent Seats in the United Nations Security Council. Italy started this group with help from Canada and Pakistan and wanted to be against giving the permanent seats wanted by the G4 countries (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan). The UfC wants a consensus, or agreement before any decision is formed on the United Nation Security Council. == Comparison == Country Continent UN funding2 Member of the UN since International trade1 GDP (nominal)1 GDP (PPP)1 Defense budget1 Active military Population G20 OECD DAC Europe 3.307% 1955 948,600 2,120,232 2,610,563 40,800 347,927 59,045,521 North America 2.734% 1945 947,200 2,015,983 1,978,816 18,600 68,250 38,610,406 Asia 2.267% 1991 1,170,900 1,823,852 2,436,872 50,100 630,000 51,671,569 Europe 2.146% 1955 715,200 1,439,958 1,959,037 5,767 132,798 47,394,223 * Europe / Asia 1.371% 1945 417,000 795,952 2,749,570 18,200 639,551 84,680,273 North America 1.292% 1945 813,500 1,285,518 2,613,797 11,600 280,506 126,014,024 South America 0.915% 1945 142,370 455,172 1,015,008 4,021 73,100 45,808,747 Asia 0.115% 1947 58,000 286,340 1,370,075 7,600 643,800 225,200,000 Europe 0.017% 1964 9,200 10,582 23,501 42 2,130 514,564 South America 0.288% 1945 314,464 1,014,978 293,200 52,085,168 North America 0.062% 1945 64,282 139,482 0 5,212,173 Europe 0.002% 1992 1,702 2,694 0 33,661 1USD millions 2Percent contributed to total UN budget Spain is not part of the Uniting for Consensus group but was permanently invited. ==References== Category:United Nations Security Council Category:1990s establishments Category:Organizations",
