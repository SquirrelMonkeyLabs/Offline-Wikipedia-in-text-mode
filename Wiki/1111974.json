 "text": "Aquapets are toys that kids can play with. They were first made in 2004 by a company called Wild Planet in the United States. They are like little electronic pets. Each Aquapet is in a small, clear container filled with water. Inside, there is a small figure. The base of the Aquapet has a tiny computer chip, a microphone, and a speaker. When kids make sounds or talk to their Aquapets, they can hear them and respond. Each Aquapet has its own look, sounds, and songs. They can move and play music. The more kids play with their Aquapets, the more songs they can hear and the more active they become. Category:Toys",
