 "text": "The Mindanao bubble-nest frog or smooth-skinned tree frog (Philautus worcesteri) is a type of frog. It lives in the mountains in the Philippines. This frog lives in trees in forests that are not too high up on mountains. The drier the air is, the less this frog sings. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, and because it is good at living in places that humans have changed, but they believe people cutting down its forests may harm it. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
