 "text": "Brahmagupta () (born , died ) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. He was the author of two early works on mathematics and astronomy: the Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (BSS, \"correctly established doctrine of Brahma\", dated 628). Brahmagupta was the first to give rules to compute with zero. The texts composed by Brahmagupta were composed in elliptical verse in Sanskrit, as was common practice in Indian mathematics. As no proofs are given, it is not known how Brahmagupta's results were derived. ==References== ==Other websites== * Brahmagupta's Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta edited by Ram Swarup Sharma, Indian Institute of Astronomical and Sanskrit Research, 1966.
