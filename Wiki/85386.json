 "text": "The auditory system is the sensory system for the sense for hearing. The sense organ for hearing is the ear. == Structure of the ear== === Outer ear === The outer ear is the folds of cartilage surrounding the ear canal. They are called the pinna. === Middle ear === Sound waves travelling through the ear canal will hit the tympanum, or eardrum. Three tiny bones, the ossicles, convert the waves to high pressure vibrations. They are then converted to nerve impulses in the cochlea. === Inner ear === The inner ear is made mostly of the cochlea. The cochlea is made up of three pieces, and is filled with liquid. It transforms sound waves to electric signals in neurons. The semicircular canals of the inner ear are used in equilibrioception, the sense of balance. == Related pages == * Visual system and Eyes * Vertigo * Balance == Other websites == * Promenade 'round the cochlea * Washington University Neuroscience Tutorial - Auditory system Category:Hearing",
