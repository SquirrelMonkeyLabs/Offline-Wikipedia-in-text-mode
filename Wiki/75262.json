 "text": "Main-Franconian is group of German dialects that are spoken in the centre of Germany, in the area known as Franconia near the river Main. In Germany most people call these dialects simply “Fränkisch”. Although they have a lot in common there are many variations from one small region to another. Historically Franconia (German: “Franken”) was a very large area covering a lot of Germany including parts of the Rhine as far as the Netherlands. Today Franconia is the north part of Bavaria (German: “Bayern”) including what is known as Lower Franconia, Upper Franconia, Mid-Franconia and parts of Upper Bavaria. ==Examples of Franconian dialect== Typical for Franconian dialects is the voiceless consonants becoming voiced, i.e. “k” pronounced like “g”, “t” like “d”, “p” like “b” and “s” like English “z”. In pubs one often hears on the public address system a request for a member of staff *”bidde dzur dege gommen” * *English: Please come to the bar. *Vo da Dande a Bageed griing means: * *English: “To receive a parcel from one’s auntie“ The pronunciation of vowels may be different from normal German, e.g. Franconia is often described as the place where: *”die Hasen ‘Hoosn’ und die Hosen ‘Huusn’ haasn.” *i.e. ‘Hasen‘ (‘hares‘) are called ‘Hoosn‘ (‘Hosen’=’trousers’) and ‘Hoosn’ are called ‘Husen’. (German “Hasen” has an “a” as in British “car”; “Hosen” has an “o” similar to “oa” in “boat”; “Husen”, which does not mean anything, has a “u” like British “oo” in “moon”). An angry Franconian might say: *”Der Hamml, der gscheerde, der ko wos erlehm, wenna haam kummd!” * *English: “The rotten fellow will be in trouble when he gets home!“ ==References== *“Fränkisch” by Jens Sobisch; Kauderwelsch 186, ASMB 3-89416-474-3 Category:German dialects Category:Languages of Germany",
