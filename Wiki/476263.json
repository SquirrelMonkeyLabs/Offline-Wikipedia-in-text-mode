 "text": "A concealed weapon is a dangerous weapon that is hidden from view. It can also be a dangerous weapon under a person's control that is not readily visible. The term is most often applied to handguns. A dangerous weapon is any weapon that can inflict death or serious injury on another person. Various jurisdictions define what a dangerous weapon is. Carrying a concealed weapon is illegal as defined by laws of many states,Carl Brown, 'Nunchucks and Throwing Stars in Your State?', Black Belt, Vo. 32, No. 8 (August 1994), pp. 80â€“82, 112, 144 provinces, and countries. The usual exceptions are law enforcement officers and members of the military who carry weapons as part of their jobs.John Scheb; John Scheb, II, Criminal Law (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2012), p. 357 Many jurisdictions may issue concealed weapons permits (also called concealed carry permits) giving individuals permission to carry a concealed weapon within their jurisdiction.Alice Adams, Trucking Rules and Regulations: A Reference Guide to Transportation Industry (Clifton Park, NY ; London: Thomson Delmar Learning, 2005), p. 70 == Concealed weapon laws == Carrying a concealed weapon (CCW) is the practice of carrying a handgun out of sight, hidden somewhere on a person's body. CCW is regulated by the states in the US. The laws vary, sometimes considerably, from state to state. As of 2015, most states grant licenses to carry handguns on a \"Shall-Issue\" basis to qualified applicants. Shall-Issue means the jurisdiction issuing the license must issue the license to anyone who is not otherwise prevented from owning a firearm. \"May-Issue\" allows the jurisdiction to decide on a case-by-case basis who may be issued a license. A few states are may-issue states, while seven states allow the carrying of firearms in a concealed manner without a permit (called Constitutional-carry). == Global gun laws == Gun laws vary considerably around the world. The larger majority of countries heavily restrict or do not allow citizens to carry firearms. === United States and Canada === Penalties for carrying a concealed weapon in the US without a permit can vary by jurisdiction. In some cases it is a misdemeanor but more often it is considered a felony. In Canada CCW is illegal but permitted under rare circumstances. === Mexico === In Mexico civilians cannot own guns since it has been illegal since 1968. However, most Mexicans own guns, even fully automatic weapons. In South Africa there are about 6 million licensed handgun owners. There is also a very large backlog of those applying for a license. Illegal guns can be easily bought off the streets. About 2,000 guns are stolen per month from licensed owners making it the largest source of illegal guns. == References == Category:Weapons",
