 "text": "Plate boundaries refers particularly to places where continental plates touch or have touched in the past. The major types of plate boundaries are: # Spreading boundaries. Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Africa's Great Rift Valley are examples. Rift valleys, mountains (orogeny), volcanoes. # Collision boundaries. These collide, forming a subduction zone (West coast of the Americas) or a continental collision (India with Asia). Mountains (orogeny), valleys, volcanoes. # Transform or fault boundaries. Here plates grind past each other along transform faults. Earthquakes and volcanoes often occur along the fault. # Conservative boundaries: little or no relative motion. All boundaries except the conservative ones are sites of major geological activity. == Other websites == *Bird, P.
