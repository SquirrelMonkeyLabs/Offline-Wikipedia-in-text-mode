The video rewinds to the event where two men are waiting for 50 outside a building in a car. The men see 50 leave a convenience store and shoot him in a drive-by shooting. There are then scenes of an investigation and 50 recovering from his gunshot wounds. 50 is wheeled into a boardroom with multiple men. A hooded kidnapped man is then brought into the room and is revealed to be the man who betrayed 50. The men kill the man and put him in the trunk of a car which is later found by the investigators. Another man is shot while sitting in a car and another is killed after meeting 50 in a restaurant. The events of the music video are based on the real life shooting of 50 Cent.
