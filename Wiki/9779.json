Incumbent President Vladimir Putin, though not a member of the party, is its de-facto Leader. The party has most of the seats in the State Duma and in the Regional Parliaments. Because of this, United Russia is the most powerful political party in Russia. Two large parties merged in 2001 to form United Russia. Category:Political parties in Russia",
