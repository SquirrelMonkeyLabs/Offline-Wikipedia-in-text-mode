 "text": "The 2016 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 26 June 2016, to elect the 12th Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 266 seats in the Senate. Opinion polling going into the election predicted a growing polarisation between this alliance and the People's Party (PP), which would be fighting to maintain first place nationally. In the end, the alliance suffered a surprise decline in votes and vote share compared to the previous election, while the PP increased its number of votes and seats. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), while clinging on to second place, kept losing votes and seats and scored a new historical low. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was re-elected as Prime Minister for a second term in office on 29 October amid public outcry and protest. ==Candidates== File:Mariano Rajoy 2016m (cropped).jpg|Mariano Rajoy (People's Party) from Madrid File:Pedro Sánchez 2015h (cropped).jpg|Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) from Madrid File:Pablo Iglesias 2016b (cropped).jpg|Pablo Iglesias (Unidos Podemos) from Madrid File:Albert Rivera 2016a (cropped).jpg|Albert Rivera (Cs) from Madrid File:Gabriel Rufián (election).jpg|Gabriel Rufián (ERC–CatSí) from Barcelona File:Francesc Homs 2016 (cropped).jpg|Francesc Homs (CDC) from Barcelona ==Results== ===Chamber of Deputies=== ===Senate=== ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== Category:2010s elections in Spain Category:2016 elections in Europe Category:Spanish general elections",
