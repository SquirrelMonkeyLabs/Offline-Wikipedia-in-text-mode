One means that each of its member will attract audiences in 4 minutes and this is why all of their songs are shorter than 4 minutes. The other meaning is that they will do their best for a minute (for every moment). Kim Hyun-ah already released two singles. She used to be a member of Wonder Girls and Kwon So-hyun was a member of girl group Orange.
