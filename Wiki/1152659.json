At the end of the episode, the bongo is preyed upon by a female Tyrannosaurus rex known as Roberta, and her two children named Tyrannos and Sauros. == Episodes == Episode name Year Planned release Plot Dinosaur Existence July Any day In the Island of Dwarfs, a family of Apatosaurus are going through their daily routine. Two juvenile males are sparring to establish their dominance amongst other males of the same species when they are older. Nearby is an Agustinia and a herd of Stegosaurus. Also joining them is a mother Ankylosaurus and her male calf; and finally, the last herbivorous dinosaur to arrive is a female Iguanodon.
