Scientists think that this frog could be in danger from people cutting down trees even though it is against the law to cut down trees where this frog lives. One of the places the frog lives, Lawachara National Park, is a protected park. Scientists named this frog for Dr. Mohammad Ali Reza Khan, an animal scientist from Bangladesh. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
