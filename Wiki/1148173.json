 "text": "Double zero flour, also known as doppio zero or 00 flour, is a finely ground Italian flour commonly used to make pasta and pizza dough. In Italy and other parts of Europe, grind sizes vary from double zero to two. Double zero is the finest grind, and two is the coarsest. The term “double zero” does not refer to gluten content or the amount of protein in the flour. In the United States, producers base flour grades on protein content. Fine flours, like cake flour or pastry flour, have low protein levels best for a delicate, moist crumb. Relatively coarser flours, like bread flour and all-purpose flour, contain more protein, and thus, more gluten. You can find many imported types of wheat flour in tipo 00 (or type 00). Semolina (hard durum wheat), whole wheat, pastry flour, pizza flour, and high-protein flour are available with a double zero grind size. You can use these different flours for various baking needs, such as semolina for fresh pasta and pastry flour for baked goods with a fine crumb. ==References== Category:Flour",
