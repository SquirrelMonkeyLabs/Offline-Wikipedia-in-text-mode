It premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on May 2, 2022, and was released in the United States on May 6. ==Plot== Following the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), Dr. Stephen Strange casts a forbidden spell that opens the door to the multiverse, including an alternate version of Strange, whose threat to humanity is too great for the combined forces of Strange, Wong, and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch. ==Cast== * Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange: A neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a car accident that ended his career. Cumberbatch also portrays three alternate versions of the character: a version that dies at the start of the movie, wearing a costume inspired by Matt Faction's 2011 Defenders comic book series; the former Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-838 who founded the Illuminati; and a version who has been corrupted by the Darkhold. * Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch: A former Avenger gone rogue who can harness chaos magic, engage in telepathy and telekinesis, and alter reality. Olsen also portrays the character's Earth-838 counterpart. * Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo: The Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-838 and a member of the Illuminati. He is an alternate version of Strange's former mentor-turned-enemy. * Benedict Wong as Wong: The Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-616 and Strange's mentor and friend. * Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez: A teenager that has the ability to travel through dimensions by punching open doorways. She comes from a different universe known as the Utopia Parallel. * Michael Stuhlbarg as Nicodemus West: A surgeon and former colleague of Strange. * Rachel McAdams as Christine Palmer: An emergency surgeon who was a colleague and lover of Strange. McAdams also portrays the character's Earth-838 counterpart who is an employee of the Baxter Foundation and the former lover of that reality's Strange. This version of the character helps resolve Strange's love story with his own version of Palmer, allowing him to move on to a potential new relationship in the future. Additional members of the Illuminati of Earth-838 include Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier / Professor X, portraying a different version of the character that he previously played in 20th Century Fox's X-Men movie series; Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter / Captain Carter, after voicing a similar version of the character in the animated series What If...?

Also appearing in the movie are Adam Hugill as Rintrah, a minotaur-like being from R'Vaal who is a student at Kamar-Taj; and the creature Gargantos, with its design based on the comic book creature Shuma-Gorath. Ross Marquand voices the Ultron drones that appear on Earth-838.
