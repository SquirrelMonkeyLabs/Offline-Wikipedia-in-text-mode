 "text": "Theranos is a bankrupt American technology corporation in the field of medical services. It was founded in 2003 by a 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes. It is considered a big scam. For a long time, the founders advertised their startup as a breakthrough technology company. They claimed to have developed blood tests that needed only small amounts of blood. The tests could be passed very quickly with the help of compact automated devices developed by the company. Later the statements turned out to be untrue. In 2018, the company was declared bankrupt. Founder Elizabeth Holmes is under investigation. She was fined and banned from running any company for 10 years. == References == Category:Health technology Category:American technology companies",
