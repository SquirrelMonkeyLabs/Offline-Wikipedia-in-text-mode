 "text": "A toast sandwich is a type of sandwich. The filling of the sandwich is a thin slice of bread that is toasted. This piece of bread may be buttered. A recipe from 1861 says to add salt and pepper to change the taste of the sandwich. ==Victorian recipe== A recipe for toast sandwiches is in the invalid cookery section of the 1861 Book of Household Management by Isabella Beeton. She adds, \"This sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat, or very fine slices of cold meat, to the toast, and in any of these forms will be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid.\" ==Modern versions== In November 2011, the toast sandwich was recreated by the Royal Society of Chemistry after the release of Beeton's Book of Household Management. They wanted to bring back the forgotten dish. They said it cost as little as per sandwich. They named it \"the country's most economical lunch\". The society said they would give to anyone who could make a cheaper edible meal. Many people sent them recipes. Because of this, the offer was ended seven days later. The Â£200 was given to a randomly selected person. ==References== Category:Sandwiches",
