The struggle between the two nations is known as the Anglo–Zulu War.Knight, Ian 2010. Zulu Rising. London. ISBN 0-330-44593-6 The British army, commanded by Lord Chelmsford, invaded Zululand. The 24th foot made camp at Isandlwana where they were attacked by about 20,000 Zulus. Over 1,300 soldiers were killed. The Zulus themselves lost about 1,000 to 2,500 men.David, Saul 2009. \"The forgotten battles of the Zulu War\". BBC History Magazine. 10 (2). pp. 26–33. The battle was followed by the successful British defence at the Battle of Rorke's Drift. Strictly speaking, the war was between the colonial Government of Natal and the Zulu nation. The colony (which later became South Africa) made its own decisions.Knight, Ian 2003. The Zulu War 1879. Osprey.
