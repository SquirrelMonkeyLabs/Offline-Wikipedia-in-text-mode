 "text": "Mickey Mouse is a parody of Mickey Mouse from the American late-night talk show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. He is based on the version from Steamboat Willie, which entered the public domain on January 1, 2024. ==Creation== A part of the show's April 2, 2023 episode (\"Solitary Confinement\") talked about Steamboat Willies copyright ending soon and what Disney has done to keep it. John Oliver said because they and Mickey Mouse are so closely known, they would say any unofficial use of Mickey would confuse some people. John then revealed the season's opening titles use an image from Steamboat Willie and his version of Mickey Mouse is now the show's mascot. He said: John also said a Mickey Mouse costume would be released on January 1, 2024. It could be used for birthday parties, funerals, theme park openings, sex dungeons and other purposes. He then said Disney would have to sue him so he knows what they will do to keep Mickey Mouse's copyright. ==Personality== Mickey Mouse often says bad things about notable people, such as \"Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself\", \"Where's Shelly Miscavige?\", and \"I hope Henry Kissinger dies soon\". ==References== Category:Comedy Category:Fictional mice and rats Category:Parodies",
