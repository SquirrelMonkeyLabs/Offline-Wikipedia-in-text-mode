He is the only son and the successor of Emperor Nongda Lairen Pakhangba () and Empress Laisana. It was during his era that the time measuring device (pung/poong) and a traditional drum (a musical instrument) (pung/poong) were invented in the kingdom for the first time. Various experments were carried out for the perfection of the traditional drum. At first, deer skin was used, secondly, tiger skin and thirdly, cow skin was used in making the drum. The Chinglon Laaihui accounts for his expedition to find out metal ores, especially gold and silver ores in the kingdom. He is one of the nine kings associated with the design of a royal flag. ==Other websites== * Niṃthaurola śaireṃ * Society, Politics, and Development in North East India * Folk Culture of Manipur * Manipur * Folk-lore (India) * Time Measuring Device ==References== Category:Kings of Ancient Manipur Category:History of Manipur",
