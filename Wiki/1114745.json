 "text": "The Boquete rocket frog (Silverstoneia nubicola) is a species frog. It lives in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. This frog lives on the ground in rainforests. People have seen this frog between 0 and 1600 meters above sea level. People have seen the frog in forests that have been cut down and are growing back and in tree farms. The female frog lays eggs in dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles streams. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place and because the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has killed many animals there. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal sickness chytridiomycosis. Scientists also say climate change could hurt this frog. People also cut down the forests where the frog lives to make farms, to make places for cows, and to get wood to build with. People also hurt the frog's home by digging for gold and platinum metals, which puts bad chemicals and dirt in the water where the frogs and tadpoles swim. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
