 "text": "The New York City Marathon is a yearly marathon that goes through all five boroughs of New York City. The distance of the race is 26.219 miles. It starts at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and ends at Columbus Circle. It takes place on the first Sunday of November. It is one of the largest marathons in the world. 50,304 people ran the marathon in 2013. It has been held every year since 1970 except for 2012, when the race was cancelled because of Hurricane Sandy. Most runners finish the 26.2-mile course during the day, but some participants continue into the evening. These runners often have personal challenges and inspiring stories. One such participant is Asha Noppeney from Germany. At age seven, she lost her right leg in a bicycle accident in Uganda. Despite this, she became an athlete and started running marathons at age 40. In the 2019 New York City Marathon, she finished after 13 hours, crossing the line at 10:05 p.m. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:Marathons Category:Sports in New York City",
