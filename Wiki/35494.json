She was a member of the girl band Mis-Teeq and is also known for being a judge on Britain's Got Talent. She was born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England. Her mother was Scottish. Her father was Jamaican. Dixon released her first UK solo album, The Alesha Show, in 2008. ==Mis-Teeq== Dixon's career began in 1999 when she met Sabrina Washington. They had both joined Dance Attic (a popular dance class school in West London). They recorded a demo called \"Inspiration\". During an audition, they met with Su-Elise Nash, and then formed a trio. They were soon signed to Telstar Records with a new member, Zena McNally. They became the popular UK garage/R&B; girl band Mis-Teeq. They released their first single \"Why?\" in 2000. Soon, McNally left the band to perform by herself. The band decided to remain a trio. In 2001, they released their first album Lickin' On Both Sides. It had the songs \"All I Want\", \"One Night Stand\", \"B With Me\" and \"Roll On / This Is How We Do It\". In 2003, they released their second album Eye Candy. That album had the songs \"Scandalous\", \"Can't Get It Back\" and \"Style\". In 2004, Mis-Teeq toured the United States. They released their first single \"Scandalous\" from their first American album Mis-Teeq. Mis-Teeq was a compilation of the albums Lickin' On Both Sides and Eye Candy. They released One Night Stand before coming back to Europe to start work with their third album. However, Telstar Records was shut down and the band had to have a 'Greatest Hits' compilation released under exclusive licenses with Universal Recording Company. Dixon appeared in the N.E.R.D. music video for \"She Wants to Move\". That song was from N.E.R.D.'s second album Fly or Die. The last song Dixon recorded with her band was \"Shoo Shoo Baby\". It was recorded for the Disney movie Valiant. In March 2005, they released their 'Greatest Hits' compilation. They also announced that they were going to start working separately. Dixon later announced that she signed a ₤500,000 contract deal with Polydor Records. She also announced that she will work on material for her first solo album. In the summer of 2005, she married her long-time fiancé, rapper MC Harvey (formerly of So Solid Crew). ==Solo career== Dixon spent a year preparing for her solo first album, Fired Up. In June 2005, she announced the single \"Superficial\". After the song leaked illegally, the company said her next single would be \"Lipstick\". She released \"Lipstick\" on 14 August 2006. It went to number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. Dixon worked with several producers for her first solo album, including Richard X, Xenomania, Johnny Douglas, Brian Higgins, and Paul Eppe. She worked on a song with famous UK singer Estelle. Dixon announced that her second single would be \"Knock Down\". She calls the song \"reggae-influenced\". It was released on 30 October 2006. An album promo of Fired Up was released during the early weeks of September. It had the songs \"Lipstick\", \"Knock Down\", \"Ting-A-Ling\", \"Fired Up\", and \"Free\". All those songs were expected to be on her first album. After \"Knock Down\" did not chart in the top 40, her record company dumped her. \"Fired Up\" was not released anywhere except Japan. After winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2007 she made a comeback. In 2008, Dixon released \"The Boy Does Nothing\", the lead single from her album The Alesha Show. She then released \"Breathe Slow\" which charted at number three on the UK Singles Chart. That was her highest-charting single so far. Dixon gave birth to her first child, Azura Sienna, in 2013. ==Discography == ===Albums=== * Fired Up (2006) * The Alesha Show (2008) * The Entertainer (2010) * Do It For Love (2015) ===Singles=== Single Year Album Peak chart positions UK AUS CZE FIN FRA IRE NL SPA SWI EU \"Lipstick\" 2006 Fired Up 14 — — — — 42 — — — — \"Knockdown\" 45 — — — — — — — — — \"The Boy Does Nothing\" 2008 The Alesha Show 5 8 1 2 2 19 5 2 7 5 \"Breathe Slow\" 2009 3 — 12 — — 18 — 20 — 13 \"Let's Get Excited\" 13 — — 14 — 36 — — — 40 \"To Love Again\" 15 — — — — — — — — — \"Drummer Boy\" 2010 The Entertainer 15 — — — — 23 — 26 — 28 \"Radio\" 46 — 44 — — — — — 57 — \"Every Little Part of Me\" (featuring Jay Sean) 2011 78 — — — — — — — — — \"The Way We Are\" 2015 Do It For Love — — — — — — — — — — \"Tallest Girl\" — — — — — — — — — — \"People Need Love\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Stop\" (featuring Wretch 32) 2016 — — — — — — — — — — \"—\" single did not chart or was not released in that territory == References == == Other websites == * Official Alesha Dixon website Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Atlantic Records artists Category:English dancers Category:English models Category:Jamaican singers Category:English R&B; singers Category:21st- century British singer-songwriters Category:Black British musicians Category:Musicians from Hertfordshire",
