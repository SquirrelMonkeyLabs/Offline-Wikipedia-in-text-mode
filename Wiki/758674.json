When passing through Bocche and following the main road down to Portofino Mare, at a certain point along the route, you can see, embedded in the conglomerate, a marble plaque with the inscription: “Here the beauty of the world smiled for the last time”. Giuseppe Amisani spent time at this location in 1941 and frequently painted outdoors. ==References== Category:Settlements in Genoa",
