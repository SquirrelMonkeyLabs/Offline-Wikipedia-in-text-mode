 "text": "The Utmankhel are a Pashtun tribe who live in the hills to the north of Peshawar in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Their land lies between the Mohmands and the Ranizais of Swat, to the west and south-west of the junction of the Swat and Panjkora rivers. They claim to be descendants of Baba Utman Shamraiz, who accompanied Sher Shah Suri in his expedition into India . The Utman Khel are a tall, stout and fair race, but their dress and general customs have been assimilated by the neighbouring peoples of Bajour. Their land is very hilly and difficult, but has well cultivated terraces. The British conducted military campaigns against them in 1852, 1878, and 1898. They numbered some 40,000, and their fighting strength was about 8000 men. There are some subtribes of Utman Khel. These are called: # Mandal (elder son of Utman) # Sawar Khel # Mutaki # Toori Khel # Ali Khel # Utman zai # Ibrahim Khel # Raja khel # Najeem khel # Aghdad khel # Ali Zai # Boota Khel # Bazai # Ismail Khel # Umar khel # Khumar Khel # Kamal Khel # sarni Khel # Sarkani khel # Sikandar khel ==References== Category:Tribes of Pakistan Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan Category:Ethnic groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa",
