 "text": "Interstate 29 (I-29) is an Interstate Highway in the United States. It goes from Kansas City, Missouri, north to Pembina, North Dakota, at the Canada border. The route is long. ==Route description== I-29 starts in Kansas City, Missouri. It is a very hilly route, and it is surrounded by forests. It travels north through the city of St. Joseph, and then enters Iowa. In Iowa, I-29 runs near the Missouri River and runs through many cities that were settled on the river like Council Bluffs, which is a suburb of Omaha, and Sioux City. North of Sioux City, the highway curves to the west and enters South Dakota. Here the route becomes very flat and the area around the highway turns to plains. I-29 passes by Sioux Falls, Brookings, and Watertown. Then, it enters the Glacier Lakes area of South Dakota, which is very hilly. North of here, the route enters North Dakota and becomes flat again. In North Dakota, I-29 runs just to the west of the Red River of the North. It runs through Fargo and Grand Forks before it reaches the Canadian border. I-29 ends here, but the road continues north into Canada, and is known as Manitoba Highway 29. ==References== 29",
