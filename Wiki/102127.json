 "text": "Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album (though counted as the twelfth official album) recorded by The Beatles. It was released in September 1969. Side one consisted of hits, while side two consisted of short songs to make up a story. ==Album songs== ;Notes *\"Her Majesty\" is a hidden track. Between \"The End\" and \"Her Majesty\" is 14 seconds of silence. Later releases of the album included the song on the track listing. *One cassette tape version in the US had \"Come Together\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\" swapped so that Harrison's song starts the album. All other versions (including the CD) have restored the track listing to its original order. *Tracks 9 through 13 are sometimes noted as one song (medley) called \"The Abbey Road Medley\". *Tracks 14 through 16 are sometimes noted as one song called \"The Golden Slumbers Medley\". All songs written by Lennon/McCartney unless credited differently. Category:The Beatles albums Category:1969 albums Category:Rock albums",
