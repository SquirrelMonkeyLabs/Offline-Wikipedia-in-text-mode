A controversial figure in Peruvian politics, his government is credited with the creation of Fujimorism, defeating the Shining Path insurgency and restoring Peru's macroeconomic stability.Fox, Elizabeth, and Fox, de Cardona and Waisbord, Silvio Ricardo. Latin Politics, Global Media. 2002, p. 154 In 2001, Fujimori's head of intelligence, Vladimiro Montesinos, was accused of doing illegal things. People thought that Fujimori was also involved. After that, Fujimori went to Japan, because he had Japanese ancestors, thus is a citizen there. Japan protected him from Peruvian law since they do not find any valid accusation. Fujimori resigned the Presidency of Peru. Valent√≠n Paniagua was elected president by the Congress soon after Fujimori resigned. His daughter, Keiko Fujimori is also a politician and ran for president three times, the most recent being is 2021. ==Prison and release== In 2005 Fujimori was detained in Chile.

On 24 December 2017, President Kuczynski pardoned him on health grounds but in 2019 he was put back in prison. He was released in December 2023 because of bad health. ==Death== Fujimori died of problems caused by tongue cancer on September 11, 2024 in Lima at the age of 86. == References == ==Other websites== * Biography and tenure by CIDOB Foundation * * * * * The Fall of Fujimori on POV at PBS, 2006 * State of Fear a documentary of Peru's war on terror based on the findings of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission Category:1938 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Anti-communists Category:Presidents of Peru Category:Extradition Category:Deaths from tongue cancer",
