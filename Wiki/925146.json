 "text": "Sorority Boys is a 2002 American comedy movie. Wallace Wolodarsky directed it. It is about a group of college boys who dress up as girls to prove they did not steal from their friends. Along the way, they learn about unfairness toward women. The movie starred Barry Watson, Michael Rosenbaum and Harland Williams. ==Plot== Three college friends, Dave, Adam, and Dooferwho are head of the Social Committee in a fraternity house called Kappa Omicron Kappa (\"KOK\" sounds like a slang word for penis)are living the party lifestyle. The KOKs throw wild parties. Many other college students like to come to these parties, but the KOKs are mean to the women. For example, they take photographs of women waking up after having sex with a KOK. They do not allow ugly women to come to their parties. They often make fun of the all-girl sorority group Delta Omicron Gamma (\"DOG\" is a slang word for \"unattractive woman\"), who protest the actions of the KOKs as rude and sexist. The frat president, Spence, accuses Dave, Adam, and Doofer of stealing money from the frat treasury. Spence convinces the other KOKs that the three are thieves, and they are kicked out of the house. Doofer tells his friends that he thinks Spence himself stole the money. Because the frat's safe was in Adam's room, he says, Adam may have accidentally recorded Spence stealing the money while Adam was making a movie of a sexual encounter. But to find the tape, they must re- enter the house. Doofer says they should dress as beautiful women so that the KOKs will let them into the house during the next party. They call themselves Adina, Roberta, and Daisy. The KOKs believe that all three are women, but they throw them out of the frat for not being beautiful enough. The women of the DOG sorority rescue Dave, Adam, and Doofer, thinking they are \"plus-size girls\" and let them stay at their sorority house. For the rest of the movie, the boys switch between wearing their own clothes and dressing as women. They try to sneak back into the KOK house to find the tape many times. Along the way, they become friends with the DOG sisters. They learn that they and the KOKs had been treating women very badly. All three become better and wiser men. ==Cast== ==Reception== Critics said this was a very bad movie. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 12% based on 65 reviews, with an average score of 3.22/10. The website reads: \"A sloppy fratboy movie, Sorority Boys offers up a parade of gross-out gags and sex jokes, while insulting and ogling women.\" On Metacritic, the movie has a rank of 25 out of 100 based on 20 critics, meaning that most critics had not liked it. The movie cost $12 million budget and only made a little more money than that: $12,517,488 worldwide. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the movie a score of a \"B,\" saying that \"There are moments of real funniness in this smarter-than- anticipated goof-fest.\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the movie 1.5 stars out of 5, explaining his reasoning by the fact that \"Sorority Boys only confirms the threat posed to the film industry when homo-wary frat boys are allowed to play director.\" The New York Timess A. O. Scott criticized the movie's director, saying that \"[he] has made a film that even a rabid lowbrow like Homer Simpson (or, when the mood strikes, this critic) would find beneath his dignity.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:American movies Category:Cross-dressing in movies Category:Movies about fraternities and sororities",
