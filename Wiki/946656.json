It was directed by Aleksandr Ptushko. ==Plot== Three sisters were sitting by a window. Each sister dreamed about what they would give if the Tsar married them. The oldest promised a big party with lots of food, the middle one said she would make sure everyone had fancy clothes, and the youngest said she would give the Tsar a brave son. The Tsar liked what the youngest sister said the best, so he married her. This made the older sisters very jealous. The Tsar made the jealous sisters work in his palace - one as a cook and the other as a weaver. Later, the Tsar had to go to war. His wife wrote him a letter saying their son was born. The jealous sisters found the letter and tricked the Tsar into sending a message back. The message said to put the wife and child in a barrel and throw them into the sea. But instead of sinking, the barrel floated to a lonely island. There, a magical swan saved them. The swan turned into a princess who made a beautiful city for the wife and son. She named the son Prince Gwidon and helped him visit his father in secret. After some time, the Tsar found the city and realized it was his wife and son. The jealous sisters were angry, but the Tsar didn't listen to them anymore. ==Cast== *Vladimir Andreyev as Tsar Saltan *Larisa Golubkina as Queen *Oleg Vidov as Prince Gvidon *Ksenia Ryabinkina as Princess Swan (voiced by Nina Gulyaeva) *Sergey Martinson as Guardian of Saltan *Olga Viklandt as Mother-in-law (credited as \"O.
