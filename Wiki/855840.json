 "text": "SeaWorld is a group of theme parks in the United States. There are dolphins and whales, some of which have been trained to perform for people who watch. There are SeaWorld parks in Orlando, Florida, San Antonio, Texas, and San Diego, California. ==Controversy== Human beings have learned more about dolphins and whales since the first SeaWorld was built. People have started to ask whether it is good to keep them in places like SeaWorld. Scientists say that dolphins and whales need much more space and much more time with other dolphins and whales than people used to think they did. There have also been accidents. Sometimes a whale will attack its human trainer. The mini-series Blackfish told the story of an orca named Tilikum that attacked a trainer named Dawn Brancheau. People from SeaWorld say that they are doing good things for whales and dolphins by allowing people to see them close up. ==References== Category:Aquariums Category:Theme parks in the United States",
