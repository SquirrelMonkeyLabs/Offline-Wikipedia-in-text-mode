 "text": "The Angry Birds Movie (also known simply as Angry Birds) is a 2016 computer- animated comedy movie. It is based on Rovio Entertainment's video game series of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures and Rovio Animation, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It was directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly in their directorial debuts, and written by Jon Vitti. ==Plot== Red lives on Bird Island and is infamous for having severe anger issues. He has an outburst after he runs late to a child's birthday party and is later sentenced to anger management class in court. There, he meets Matilda, Chuck, Terence, and Bomb. Red avoids spending time with them. The next day, a boat arrives on the shore of Bird Island and destroys Red's house with its anchor. Leonard, a pig, steps off the ship with his first officer Ross and gains the birds' friendship, except for Red. After getting kicked out of a party held by the pigs, Red invites Chuck and Bomb to sneak onto the pigs' boat; Red is suspicious that they're hiding something. They accidentally find a bunch of pigs hiding inside the ship. Red returns to the party to expose the pigs, which fails due to the birds' lack of trust in Red. As the pigs introduce more of their culture to Bird Island, Red unwillingly asks Chuck and Bomb to help him climb the tallest mountain in the middle of the island to recruit Mighty Eagle. Upon reaching the top, they find that Mighty Eagle is retired and has become lazy. While the trio was gone, the pigs had built a disco to distract the birds and steal their eggs. The three birds rush back down to the village but fail to stop the pigs from getting away with all of the eggs. The next morning, the islanders apologise to Red and ask him to be their leader. Red rallies them to built a boat, sail to Piggy Island and use a slingshot to break into their castle whilst attacking the city. Red, Chuck, and Bomb make it in before Terence accidentally breaks the slingshot. Before the pigs can cook the eggs for a feast, the birds almost manage to steal back the eggs with the help of Mighty Eagle before they are stopped by Leonard. An egg falls out of the net carrying all of the eggs, which Red sacrifices himself to go back for. After a lengthy fight, Red and Leonard end up in the castle's TNT storage basement and continue brawling for the egg. Red uses his anger to regain the egg and is shielded from the exploding TNT under a fallen cauldron. With the city destroyed, Red returns to the flock with the egg, which has hatched into The Blues, and gives the hatchlings to their parents. Upon returning home, the islanders thank Red by rebuilding his house in the village, which Red invites his new friends Chuck and Bomb into. In a mid-credits scene, Leonard tells Ross that he is \"hatching a new plan\". ==Voice cast== * Jason Sudeikis as Red ** Aidan McGraw as young Red * Josh Gad as Chuck * Danny McBride as Bomb * Maya Rudolph as Matilda, Poppy * Sean Penn as Terence (growls and grunts) ** Nolan North as Terence's singing voice in \"The Mighty Red Song\" (uncredited) * Kate McKinnon as Stella, Eva * Peter Dinklage as Mighty Eagle * Bill Hader as King Leonard Mudbeard / King Pig * Tony Hale as Ross, Mime Bird, Cyrus * Keegan-Michael Key as Judge Peckinpah * Blake Shelton as Earl * Charli XCX as Willow * Anthony Padilla as Hal * Ian Hecox as Bubbles * Tituss Burgess as Photog * Noah Schnapp as Jay, Blue Bird * Billy Eichner as Chef Pig, Phillip * Hannibal Buress as Edward * Ike Barinholtz as Tiny * Max Charles as Bobby * Jillian Bell as Helene, Yoga Instructor * Cristela Alonzo as Shirley * Danielle Brooks as Monica, Olive * Kevin Bigley as Greg * Adam Brown as Hug Trader * Romeo Santos as Early Bird * Geoffrey Arend as Day Care Teacher Bird * Ava Acres as Timothy * Alex Borstein as Sophie Bird, Peggy Bird * Malena Brewer as Arianna Bird * Vincent Oswald as Dylan Hatchling * Samantha Cohen as Samantha Hatchling * Josh Robert Thompson as Brad Bird, Dane the Saxophone Bird * Matt McCarthy as Rodney Pig and John Hamm (credited as Acrobat Pig) * Maddie Taylor as Hamilton Pig and Oinky (credited as Acrobat Pig) * Mckenna Grace as Ella Bird * Ali Wong as Betty Bird * Fred Tatasciore as Monty Pig * Bella Laudiero as Maya Bird * John Cohen as Johnny Bird * Clay Kaytis as Clayton the Waiter Bird * Fergal Reilly as Foreman Pig * Catherine Winder as Billy the Sign * Carlos Alazraqui as Earl's 2nd Brother * Eileen Marra, Indra Raval, Joaquin Raval and Sofie Wolfe as Hatchling Singers ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * at Sony Pictures * Category:American animated movies Category:2010s comedy movies Category:American comedy movies Category:2010s American action movies Category:2010s American adventure movies Category:2016 computer-animated movies Category:Finnish movies Category:2010s English-language movies Category:Movies about birds Category:Movies about pigs Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:Movies based on video games Category:Movies set in British Columbia",
