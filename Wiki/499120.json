 "text": "Hercules was a wooden roller coaster at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom. It was located in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It was made by Dinn Corporation. When it was made it was the tallest wooden roller coaster in the world. Because it was poorly made, the ride only worked from 1989 to 2003. During that time, the track for the ride was changed by Martin & Vleminckx. It was replaced by Hydra the Revenge in 2005. Many riders said Hercules was a very rough ride (especially the sharp turn at the bottom of the main drop). This was most likely the reason for the low number of people who used it. It was also the likely reason it was closed and taken apart in 2003. It was so rough, it was given the nickname, \"Hurt's your knees.\" ==References== Category:Roller coasters by name Category:Roller coasters in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Pennsylvania Category:1999 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Pennsylvania Category:2003 disestablishments in the United States Category:Disestablishments in Pennsylvania",
