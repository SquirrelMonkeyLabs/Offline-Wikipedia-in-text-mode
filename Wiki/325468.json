 "text": "The New York Zoo hoax was a false story. The New York Herald printed an untrue story about a fictional breakout of animals from the Central Park Zoo on November 9, 1874. It is also known as The Central Park Zoo Escape and the Central Park Menagerie Scare of 1874. The article warned that dangerous animals were loose in the city. The article said that 49 people died and 200 were injured. Many readers panicked, even though the end of the story said that everything in it was not true. The authors later said they wanted to make people pay attention to weak safety precautions at the zoo. They said they were surprised at the strong reaction to their story. ==References== * Thomas Connery, \"A Famous Newspaper Hoax.\" Harper's Weekly (June 3, 1893) * Fred Fedler, Media Hoaxes.
