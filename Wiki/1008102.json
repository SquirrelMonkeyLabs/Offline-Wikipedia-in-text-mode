 "text": "The white-striped tree frog (Zhangixalus hui) is a frog. It lives in China and Vietnam. People have seen it between 600 and 2100 meters above sea level. Scientists used to think this was the same species as Rhacophorus dugritei, but they changed their minds in 2008. People have seen this frog in forests near wet places and bodies of water and paddies. The female frog makes a nest out of foam and lays her eggs in holes near water. People have seen it between 3050 and 3350 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. Human beings cut down forests and build things for visitors. Scientists think climate change could also hurt this frog because it causes dry times and floods. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
