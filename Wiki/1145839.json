 "text": "Crude humour is humour that is an attempt to describe something as being funny, but in a way that is sexual or vulgar. It references sexual or vulgar topics in an attempt to be 'humourous'. == Veg and non-veg jokes == In some parts of the world, sexual humor in particular is known as \"non-veg\" humor, contrasted with the \"veg\" jokes that are more acceptable in polite company. The use of the term \"non-veg\" is probably a reference to the carnal nature of sexual humor, and can be viewed in the context of the prevalence of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dietary preferences. == References == Category:Humor",
