 "text": "Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States are the members of the Supreme Court of the United States other than the Chief Justice of the United States. The number of Associate Justices is ruled by the United States Congress and is currently set at eight by the Judiciary Act of 1869. ==How they are nominated== The President \"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint... Judges of the supreme Court.\" Although the Constitution refers to them as \"Judges of the Supreme Court,\" the title actually used is \"Associate Justice,\" introduced in the Judiciary Act of 1789. Associate justices were traditionally styled \"Mr. Justice\" in court opinions, but the title was shortened to \"Justice\" in 1980, a year before the first female justice was appointed.Joan Biskupic, Sandra Day O'Connor: How the First Woman on the Supreme Court Became Its Most Influential Justice (New York: HarperCollins, 2005), 101. ==Duties== Each of the Justices of the Supreme Court has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the Chief Justice's vote counts no more than that of any other Justice. ==Succession process== Under 28 USC 3, when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior Associate Justice until the disability or the vacancy ends. ==Current justices== The current Associate Justices are (in order of seniority): Justice / birthdate and place Justice / birthdate and place Appointed by SCV Age at Age at Start date / length of service Previous position or office Replaced Justice / birthdate and place Justice / birthdate and place Appointed by SCV Start Present Start date / length of service Previous position or office Replaced Pin Point, Georgia 52–48 43 Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (1990–1991) Marshall Trenton, New Jersey 58–42 55 Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (1990–2006) O'Connor The Bronx, New York 68–31 55 Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (1998–2009) Souter Manhattan, New York 63–37 50 Solicitor General of the United States (2009–2010) Stevens Denver, Colorado 54–45 49 Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006–2017) Scalia Washington, D.C. 50–48 53 Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2006–2018) Kennedy New Orleans, Louisiana 52–48 48 Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (2017–2020) Ginsburg Washington, D.C. 53–47 52 Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2021–2022) Breyer Source: Source: Source: Source: Source: Source: Source: Source: Source: ==References== ==Other websites== *Historic collection of Supreme Court decisions and biographies indexed by judge name * *[SCV]: U.S. Senate confirmation vote",
