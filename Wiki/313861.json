Iowa State University Press, Ames IA. The Dale–Chall formula is a one-variable test: it measures the difficulty of the words used. It does not measure the difficulty of the sentence structure (the syntax). One of the first readability tests, the Dale–Chall formula used a vocabulary list. It counted the number of listed words in a passage, and applied a formula which gave a grade level. It was used to rate textbooks for grade levels in US school districts. In 1995 the authors published an updated word list.Chall, Jeanne S. and Edgar Dale. 1995. Readability revisited: The new Dale–Chall readability formula. Cambridge, MA: Brookline Books It is easy, in principle, to use a vocabulary list as part of a computer-based readability measure. The list is organised as a look-up table. The percentage of listed words in a passage gives the data for the formula, and the user is presented with a grade level. == Related pages == *List of readability tests *Textual difficulty == References == Category:Reading",
