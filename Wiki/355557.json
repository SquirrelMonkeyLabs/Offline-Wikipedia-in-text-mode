 "text": "A spear thrower is a wooden tool used for throwing spears. It gives the human arm more leverage to build up the spear's velocity. This gives the spear more force and makes it go faster. Spear throwers were used in many civilisations. It was used by the Aztecs, who called it an atlatl. It is also used by Aboriginals in Australia, where it has become most widely known as a woomera (the Dharuk name for it). ==References== ==Other websites== * Aboriginal technology * World Atlatl Association Web Site Category:Weapons Category:Indigenous Australian culture",
