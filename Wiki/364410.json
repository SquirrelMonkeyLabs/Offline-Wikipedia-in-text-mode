The work was based on oral traditions which were published for the first time in the 11th century.Takei, Jiro et al. (2001). Sakuteiki Visions of the Japanese Garden: A Modern Translation of Japan's Gardening Classic, p. 3 n1. ==Types== There are many types of Japanese gardens, for example, * The contemplation or thinking style of garden (kanshō) is designed to be studied and enjoyed from one specific place. An example of a kanshō garden is the rock and raked gravel garden at Ryōan-ji in Kyoto.Rowthorn, Chris. (2008). Lonely Planet Kyoto City Guide, p. 35. * The stroll or walking style of garden (shūyū) is intended to be looked at from a path. The garden is discovered as the viewer walks along the path. An example of a shūyū garden is at Ginkaku-ji in Kyoto. * The boating or pleasure-boat style of garden (funasobi) is centered on a large pond. The best views are seen from a boat in the pond. An example of a funasobi gardem is at Byōdō-in at Uji, which is near Kyoto. * Many-pleasure style of garden (kaiyū) has a central pond and many paths. It combines aspects of kanshō, shūyū and funasobi gardens. An example of a kaiyū garden is at Katsura Imperial Villa. ==References== ==Other websites== * Japanese Gardens at GoJapan.com * Japanese Gardens at Bowdoin.edu Category:Japanese culture Category:Gardening",
