 "text": "Augustana University is a private liberal arts college in South Dakota. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The school is in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United States. The 100-acre (40 ha) campus makes the school the largest private university in South Dakota. Some people call the college “Augie.” It was first called \"The Lutheran Normal School\". It was started for the purpose of educating teachers. In 1918, the college got its current name after joining with Augustana College in Canton. This happened because synod officials worried about having enough money to run two institutions so close together. The schools were only 20 miles (32 km) apart. The college claims its founding as 1860, the same as its sister-school (which shares the same name) in Rock Island, Illinois.Augustana History. Augustana College. Retrieved on July 8, 2009.
