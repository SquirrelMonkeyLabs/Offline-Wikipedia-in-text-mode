These were the last Winter Paralympics held in a different place from the Winter Olympics. Starting in 1992, the Olympics and Paralympics were held in the same or nearby cities. The 1988 Paralympics were not held in Calgary, Canada, where the Olympics were, because of money and recruiting problems. A total of 377 athletes from 22 countries took part. The USSR competed for the first and only time. A new event called sit-skiing was added in both Alpine and Nordic skiing. Other sports were biathlon and ice sledge speed racing. Knut Lundstroem from Norway was the most successful athlete, winning four gold medals in the 100m, 500m, 1000m, and 1500m events. == Sports == * Alpine skiing * Ice sledge speed racing * Nordic skiing ** Biathlon ** Cross-country skiing == Medal table == Here are the top 10 countries (NPCs) with the most gold medals.
