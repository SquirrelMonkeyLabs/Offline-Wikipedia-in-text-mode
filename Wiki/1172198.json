 "text": "The Battle of Queenston Heights took place on 13 October 1812, during the War of 1812. It was the first major battle in the war. During the battle, U.S. Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer led an attack on Major General Isaac Brock and Canadians in Queenston in Upper Canada (current-day Ontario). Before winter arrived, the Americans made an attempt to gain territory on the Canadian side of the Niagara River. The Americans greatly outnumbered the British, Canadian and native forces but still failed. The British won the battle but Major General Brock and Lieutenant Colonel John Macdonnell were killed in action. After Brock was killed, Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe took over command of the army. The battle finally ended when the British forces and Mohawk warriors pushed the Americans back to Durham's Farm and Lieutenant Colonel Winfield Scott surrendered. The British and natives had an army of 1,366. The Americans had an army of 3,550. On the British side, there were 21 killed, 85 wounded, and 22 captured.On the American side, there were from 60 to 100 killed, 80 wounded and 955 captured (90 wounded). A 56-metre column called Brock's Monument was erected in Queenston Heights in Queenston, Ontario to honour Brock, Macdonell, and the fallen British soldiers. On June 19, 1968, the Queenston Heights site was designated as a National Historic Sites of Canada. == References == Category:1810s in North America Category:History of Ontario Category:War of 1812",
