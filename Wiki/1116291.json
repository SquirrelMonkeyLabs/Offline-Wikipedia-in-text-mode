 "text": "The Devi Movement was a social reformative movement started by Koli caste in Gujarat and Maharashtra states of India in 1920 to give up alcoholic drinks and meat. Most of the tribal communities were influenced by this movement and stopped working for Parsis because Parsis mostly ate meat and consumed the alcoholic drinks. The Devi movement among the tribes of the adjoining areas of Gujarat and Maharashtra had combined the elements of Bhakti religion and protest against exploitation of moneylenders and liquor dealers. == Spread == The Devi Movement spread over Thana, Nashik, Bharuch and Baroda districts of Maharashtra and Gujarat states. Conditions for Adivasis improved a little as a result. In 1921, the Koli peasants of Gujarat were more active in social reform movements during Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement. The excise revenue of Surat district fell by Rs 350,000. In Jalalpor taluka large numbers of Koli peasants chopped down their toddy trees and picketed liquor and toddy shops. People who continued to drink suffered severe social isolation. Under the direct guidance of Vallabhbhai Patel, the Baroda State Praja Mandal carried on the Devi Movement. The campaign continued during the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930 - 31. == Fall of Devi Movement == In Jalalpor taluka a Devi medium was prosecuted for forcing a Parsi toddy-shop owner to pay a fine of Rs 120 to a local nationalist school. He was judged guilty of extortion and sentenced to fifteen days imprisonment and a fine of Rs 300. The Devi Movement was already weak in this area, and by early February 1923, the local police chief reported that the movement had died down as a result of the prosecution. Eventually, the Devi Movement was crushed when the British government in India punished the movement's leader. == References == Category:Koli people",
