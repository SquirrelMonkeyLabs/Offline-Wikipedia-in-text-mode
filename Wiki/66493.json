 "text": "Gurkhas (Gorkhas) are Nepali Soldiers recruited into the British Army, and now also recruited into the modern Nepali and Indian Armies. They are primarily formed up of the four castes: Gurung, Magar, Rai and Limbu. They come from the mountains of Nepal and are best known for their courage, honesty, and loyalty, which according to some is inappropriate ethnic stereotyping. The Brigade of Gurkhas are a part of the British Army. They have fought with the British for the past 200 years. The Gurkha unit in the British army has won 26 Victoria Cross medals and many other medals. The Gurkhas also work in the security forces of Brunei, Singapore, India and other countries. Their symbol is the kukri or khukuri, the curved knife which they use as a weapon and a tool. Category:Nepalese military people",
