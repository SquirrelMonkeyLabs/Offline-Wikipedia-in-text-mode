 "text": "Tensile strength is a measurement of the force required to pull something such as rope, wire, or a structural beam to the point where it breaks. The tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can take before failure, for example breaking. There are three typical definitions of tensile strength: * Yield strength - The stress a material can withstand without permanent deformation. This is not a sharply defined point. Yield strength is the stress which will cause a permanent deformation of 0.2% of the original dimension. * Ultimate strength - The maximum stress a material can withstand. * Breaking strength - The stress coordinate on the stress-strain curve at the point of rupture. ==Typical tensile strengths== Some typical tensile strengths of some materials: Typical tensile strengths of some materials Material Yield strength (MPa) Ultimate strength (MPa) Density (g/cmÂ³) Structural steel ASTM A36 steel 250 400 7.8 Steel, API 5L X65 (Fikret Mert Veral) 448 531 7.8 Steel, high strength alloy ASTM A514 690 760 7.8 Maraging_Steel, Grade 350 2400 2500 8.1 Steel Wire 7.8 Steel, Piano wire c. 2000 7.8 High density polyethylene (HDPE) 26-33 37 0.95 Polypropylene 12-43 19.7-80 0.91 Stainless steel AISI 302 - Cold-rolled 520 860 8.03; Cast iron 4.5% C, ASTM A-48 130 (??) 200 7.3; Titanium Alloy (6% Al, 4% V) 830 900 4.51 Aluminum Alloy 2014-T6 400 455 2.7 Copper 99.9% Cu 70 220 8.92 Cupronickel 10% Ni, 1.6% Fe, 1% Mn, balance Cu 130 350 8.94 Brass 250 Tungsten 1510 19.25 Glass (St Gobain \"R\") 4400 (3600 in composite) 2.53 Bamboo 142 265 .4 Marble N/A 15 Concrete N/A 3 Carbon Fiber N/A 5650 1.75 Spider silk 1150 (??) 1200 Silkworm silk 500 Kevlar 3620 1.44 Vectran 2850-3340 Pine Wood (parallel to grain) 40 Bone (limb) 130 Nylon, type 6/6 45 75 1.15 Rubber - 15 Boron N/A 3100 2.46 Silicon, monocrystalline (m-Si) N/A 7000 2.33 Sapphire (Al2O3) N/A 1900 3.9-4.1 Carbon nanotube (see note below) N/A 62000 1.34 *Note: Multiwalled carbon nanotubes have the highest tensile strength of any material yet measured, with labs producing them at a tensile strength of 63 GPa, still well below their theoretical limit of 300 GPa. However, as of 2004, no macroscopic object constructed of carbon nanotubes has had a tensile strength remotely approaching this figure, or substantially exceeding that of high-strength materials like Kevlar. *Note: many of the values depend on manufacturing process and purity/composition.
