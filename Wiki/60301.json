The most important subjects of these writings are: alchemy, cosmology, numerology, astrology, medicine, magic, mysticism, and philosophy. Jabir's writings have in them the oldest known list of chemical substances. For the first time, the writings gave an explanation of how to produce an inorganic substance (ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair).; . Modern scholars doubt the historical existence of Jabir. It is probable that one person did not write all of the writings in the Jabirian corpus. Instead, scholars see Jabir ibn Hayyan as a pseudonym that a group of writers used.; . Translations into Latin of some of Jabir's Arabic writings (like the \"Book of Mercy\", and the \"Book of Seventy\") came into existence in the Middle Ages. In Latin, Jabir had the name \"Geber\", a transliteration of \"Jabir\"..
