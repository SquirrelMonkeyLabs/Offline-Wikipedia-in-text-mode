 "text": "A dolmen is a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb.Also known as 'cromlech', 'quoit', or 'portal tomb' It usually consists of three or more upright stones (megaliths) supporting a large flat horizontal capstone (table). Most date from the early Neolithic period (4000 BC to 3000 BC). Dolmens were usually covered with earth or smaller stones to form a barrow, though in many cases that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone \"skeleton\" of the burial mound intact. == Notes == Category:Prehistoric buildings and structures Category:Burial monuments and structures",
