 "text": "Extragalactic astronomy is astronomy about objects outside our Milky Way galaxy. It is the study of everything that is not covered in galactic astronomy: the study of objects in our galaxy. Because of improvements in technology, we can see distant objects in more detail. Two versions of extragalactic astronomy are: near-extragalactic astronomy (the study of galaxies in our Local Group) and far-extragalactic astronomy (the study of objects outside our Local Group). Pages on extragalactic astronomy include: * Galaxy group * Galaxy cluster * Supercluster * Quasars * Supernovae * Observable universe == References == Category:Astronomy",
