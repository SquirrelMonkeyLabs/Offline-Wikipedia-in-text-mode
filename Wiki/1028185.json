 "text": "Rywka Bajla Lipszyc (born 1929; date of death unknown) was a Jewish girl from Poland who kept a diary from October 1943 to April 1944, in the Łódź Ghetto. Lipszyc kept and wrote in the diary during World War II. The diary was found by a woman in the Auschwitz concentration camp in June 1945, where she was with the Red Army serving as a physician. The woman was unsuccessful in her attempts to find someone who would translate the diary. Decades later, the woman's granddaughter who lived in San Francisco in the U.S., who had the diary with her, contacted several Holocaust museums to try to translate the diary (she brought the diary with her from Russia in the 1990's), but to no avail, until Judy Janec, a archivist in the Holocaust Center of North California, accepted her request to translate the diary. The diary was eventually published as a book titled \"The Diary of Rywka Lipszyc\" in 2014, six years after Judy Janec translated it, in 2008.
