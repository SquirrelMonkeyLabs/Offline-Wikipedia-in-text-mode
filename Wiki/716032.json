 "text": "Induced consumption is the part of consumption that changes with disposable income. It is when there is a change in disposable income “induces” (persuades or makes someone want to do something) a change in consumption on goods and services. In contrast, spending for autonomous consumption do not change with income. For example, spending on a consumable that is considered a normal good would be considered to be induced. In the simple linear consumption function, C = a + b \\times Y_{d} induced consumption is represented by the term b \\times Y_{d}, where Y_{d} shows disposable income. b is called the marginal propensity to consume. == References == * Category:Economics",
