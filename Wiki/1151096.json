 "text": "The R42 was a train that was built between 1969 and 1970. There were 400 train cars in the fleet which were numbered from 4550-4949. The introduction of R179 caused the final R42s to be retired. After this, many of the cars were either thrown into the ocean or kept for usage by train maintainence workers. == References == Category:New York City Subway Category:CS1 maint: archived copy as title",
