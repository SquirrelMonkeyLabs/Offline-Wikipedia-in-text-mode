 "text": "The Communist Party of Germany (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands) was a major political party in the Weimar Republic between 1918 and 1933, and was reestablished as a party after the end of World War II. The party was led from 1925 by Ernst Thälmann up until Adolf Hitler took power in 1933, at which point it was pushed underground as a party. After the end of World War II, the party remained small in West Germany up until 1956, at which point it was banned as a party. == Founding == Please note that the information used in the following paragraph was gathered from the German version of this Wikipedia page. The party was founded in 1918-1919 by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in Berlin, Germany, and was founded as a direct reaction to Christmas Battles. The creation of the party took place during a three day founding conference by the merging of the Spartacus League, and the International Communists of Germany. After a suppressed uprising in 1919, generally referred to as the Spartacus Uprising, both Liebknecht and Luxemburg were killed by members of the Garde-Kavallerie-Schützen-Division. ==References== Category:1918 establishments in Germany Category:1933 disestablishments in Europe Category:Former political parties in Germany Category:Communist parties in Europe",
