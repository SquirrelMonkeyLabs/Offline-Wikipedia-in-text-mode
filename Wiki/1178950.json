 "text": "In chemistry, the platinum group are six chemical elements that are grouped together because they have many things in common. The group is named after platinum, the most common element in the group, and also includes palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. == Properties == Platinum group metals are noble metals, meaning they do not tarnish or corrode in air. == Occurrence and production == The platinum group metals have very similar chemical and physical properties, so they are often found together, and are difficult to separate. They are often found alongside copper and nickel. Methods for separating platinum group metals are often trade secrets, and rely on specific coordination complexes and salts to precipitate specific metals from solution in sequence. == References == Category:Metals",
