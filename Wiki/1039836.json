 "text": "Poundland is a British chain store founded in 1990. When it started it sold most things at the single price of £1, including clearance items and branded goods. The first pilot store opened in December 1990 following numerous rejections by landlords who were worried about a single-price store. About 7 million customers shopped in Poundland every week in 2016. They were mostly poorer women. They carried on using the slogan: \"Yes, Everything's £1!\", after they started selling items for more than £1 from the mid-2010s onwards. The Advertising Standards Authority received complaints that the slogan was misleading and ordered them to stop. They opened their 200th store in 2009. Steinhoff International bought the company for £610 million.in 2016. ==References== Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom",
