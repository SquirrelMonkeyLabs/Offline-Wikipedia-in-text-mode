 "text": "The Messiah or Anointed One is the figure who God promised to the Jews in order to save the world, according to Judeo-Christian beliefs. Sometimes real or fictional people are called messianic if they have the qualities of a messiah, or if people think they will bring about a better world. ==Biblical views== Jews believe god inspired biblical prophets to tell people that he was coming. The idea of the messiah became very important in Jewish teaching and thought during Roman rule in the 1st century BC. According to the scriptures, the messiah would rescue people from the Romans and restore the country. There are many views about how the messiah will come: as a judge, warrior, beggar, academic, philosopher, healer, or a common person. === Jesus as the Messiah === Christianity, which began in Israel with Jewish followers of Jesus (), says that the Messiah foretold by the Jewish Scriptures is Jesus. Christians believe that, fulfilling a prophecy, Jesus died for the sins of the world, rose from the dead and remains seated at God's right hand until his return. Most Jews do not hold these beliefs; those who do are sometimes called Messianic Jews. According to some Messianic Jews and other Christians, most Jews' denial that Jesus was the Messiah is, itself, the fulfillment of prophecy. (see Epistle to the Romans chapter 10) Muslims believe that Jesus was the son of Mary, a mighty prophet of God, the Messiah. (However, in Islam, the Messiah has a different role than he does in Christianity or Judaism.) Muslims believe that Jesus will someday return in his Second Coming to fight besides the Mahdi against the Dajjal (\"false messiah\"). ==References== Category:Christology Category:Islamic theology Category:Judaism Category:Jesus",
