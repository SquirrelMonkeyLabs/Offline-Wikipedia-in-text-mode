 "text": "Frostbite is the localized medical condition where freezing cold temperatures damage skin and other tissue. It is most likely to happen in body parts farthest from the heart and in body parts with large exposed areas with many blood circulations. It most often occurs in toes. It may be seen along with Hypothermia. Also, if the affected parts are not amputated, the person is likely to suffer from a disease called gangrene. ==References== == External links == Category:Health problems Category:Mountaineering and health Category:Skin conditions resulting from physical factors Category:Thermal medicine Category:Weather and health Category:Causes of amputation Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:Wilderness medical emergencies",
