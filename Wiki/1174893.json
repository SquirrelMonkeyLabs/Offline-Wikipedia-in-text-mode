In the 2005 elections, he was elected to the Parliament of Albania, representing Tirana. He was re-elected in 2009, representing Rrogozhinë. During his time in parliament, he was involved in economic and political reforms. After the Socialist Party of Albania (PS) lost the 2009 elections, Harasani had strong disagreements with the party leader, Edi Rama. He said Rama was not transparent and had allowed inner groups in the party, which he believed made the party weaker. Harasani also blamed Rama for the decision not to run as a candidate for parliament, saying this was one of the reasons they lost. In 2010, the conflict between them grew stronger. Harasani accused Rama of causing division in the party and not following the party rules. Even after leaving politics in 2013, Harasani continued to criticize Rama. He said Rama had damaged the party’s structure and was leading in an authoritarian way, which also made the opposition weaker. Harasani kept making critical comments in the following years, often using irony. He made remarks about Rama’s statements on uniting with Kosovo and about some government decisions in the economy that he disagreed with. == Later years == Harasani left politics in 2012 and moved to New York City, where he worked in the private sector. He remained active in discussions on energy policies and economic development in Albania. == Death == On March 9, 2025, Harasani died at age 53 in New York, after a long illness. His family confirmed the news. == References ==",
