 "text": "A kraken is a mythical sea creature of huge size, said to have dwelt off the coasts of Norway, Greenland, and Iceland. The legend may actually have originated from sightings of real giant squid. They are estimated to grow to 13–15 m (40–50 ft) in length, including the tentacles. The mysterious sea monster started to be talked about in literary works as far back as 1180, according to paleontologist Rodrigo Brincalepe Salvador. The first sighting was in 1769. == External links == * The King's Mirror (See Chapter XII) Monster Category:Mythological cephalopods Category:Scandinavian legendary creatures Category:Sea monsters Category:Cryptozoology",
