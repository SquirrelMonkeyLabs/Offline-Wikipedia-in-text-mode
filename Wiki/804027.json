 "text": "French-Canadian Americans (also referred to as Franco-Canadian Americans or Canadien Americans) are Americans of French-Canadian descent. About 2.1 million U.S. residents cited this ancestry in the 2010 U.S. Census; most of them speak French at home. Most Americans of French-Canadian descent are mostly in New England and the Midwest. Their ancestors mostly arrived in the United States from Quebec between 1840 and 1930 though some families had become established as early as the 17th and the 18th centuries. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in the United States",
