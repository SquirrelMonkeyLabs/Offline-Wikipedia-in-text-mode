 "text": "The Prototheria is a former subclass of mammals, now no longer in use. The name comes from Greek prōtos means 'first', and thēr, 'beast'. The only surviving animals in this subclass are the Monotremes. There are two other subclasses, the Metatheria and the Eutheria. Metatheria contains the marsupials. All the other mammals are Eutherian. Evidence is accumulating that the Prototheria is not a natural group, but alternative suggestions are not yet agreed.Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, Richard L.

Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. The term is not listed in Benton's 4th edition (2015), so it is now a dead term. == References == Category:Mammals",
