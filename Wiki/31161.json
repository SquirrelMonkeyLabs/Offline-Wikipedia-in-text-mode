 "text": "Celestia is a free 3D astronomy program for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It was created by Chris Laurel and is licensed under the GPL. The program is based on the Hipparcos Catalogue (118,218 Stars) and allows users to display objects from artificial satellites to entire galaxies in three dimensions in OpenGL. Different from other planetarium software, the user is free to travel in the universe. NASA and ESA have used Celestia, but it is not to be confused with Celestia 2000, ESA's own program. On 31st October 2022, a Chinese game developer named Linfeng Li created a mobile version of Celestia for android devices. == Related pages == * Astronomy ==References== Category:Software Category:Astronomy",
