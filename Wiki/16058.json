 "text": "Aphex Twin (born Richard David James, 18 August 1971, in Limerick, Ireland) is an Irish-born Cornish musician. He lives and works in the UK. He is a famous electronic musician. Aphex Twin is not his real name. His real name is Richard David James. His name is a combination of Aphex Systems Limited (a brand of audio signal processing equipment) and the word Twin to remember his older brother. His brother was stillborn, but given the name Richard James. == Early life == Aphex Twin was born in Limerick, Ireland. He grew up in Cornwall, U.K. He started to make music when he was a teenager. In 1991, he formed a record label called Rephlex Records. After he became well known, he moved to London. This was so he could be in a place that was closer to other people. However, he returned to Cornwall a few years later, after meeting his wife. He still makes a lot of music today, and uses many different names. He lives in an old bank. He has bought interesting things, like a tank and a submarine. == Selected works == ===Albums=== * Selected Ambient Works 85-92 (1992) * Selected Ambient Works Volume II (1994) * ...I Care Because You Do (1995) * Richard D.
