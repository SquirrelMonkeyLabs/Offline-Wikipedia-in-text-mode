 "text": "Medeco is a manufacturer of high-security locks. The name Medeco is short for Mechanical Development Company. It is a subsidiary of the Swedish Assa Abloy Group. The Medeco cylinder uses a rotating pin and sidebar design with angled cuts on the keys that rotate the pins, making it more difficult to pick than most other locks. However, it is possible to pick a Medeco lock. In 2006, it was discovered that a set of only four bump keys could open almost any Medeco lock at that time. Newer Medeco locks require a much larger set of bump keys. These keys are referred to as the \"Four Keys to the Kingdom\" among locksmiths. Medeco is owned by the ASSA ABLOY Group, which also owns Abloy and many other lock manufacturers. Category:Companies based in Virginia",
