All state government offices, community colleges, and libraries are closed, except for K-12 schools. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger suspended observance of the holiday in 2004 and 2005 to save money during the aftermath of the power crisis. It is an optional holiday in Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, and New Mexico. Californians celebrate this holiday by planting lilies in their front yard.
