 "text": "Newington Butts is a former village, now an area of south London. It is most famous as the location of the Newington Butts Theatre in the late 1500s. Some of the first performances of plays such as Hamlet, Titus Andronicus and The Taming of a Shrew happened there. It probably gets its name from an archery butts, or practice field. It is also the birthplace of the physicist Michael Faraday. == References == Category:Theatres in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Southwark",
