He is best known for his contribution to Matin Garrix' \"Gravity\" and the Official Heineken UEFA Champions League \"Ibiza Final\" Commercial. == Early life == Grootscholten was born on February 24, 1994 in Honselersdijk, Netherlands. When he was six he started playing drums, keyboard and flute. He also developed an interest in progressive house when he heard \"Save The World\" by Swedish House Mafia and taught himself how to make his own music by downloading specialist software, FL Studio, and enabling him to start composing. == Career == In the early years of his career, Sonny laid the groundwork for future success with a string of breakthrough releases by his previous artist alias \"Asonn\". Collaborations with Bobby Burns (known from his #1 hit single “From Holland”) on \"Sahara\" and with MC Ambush on \"Pyro\" demonstrated Sonny's talent. Both songs reached number one on Beatport within one week after being released. As his career gained further momentum, Sonny partnered with Heineken and UEFA to write and produce the Official Champions League \"Ibiza Final\" commercial. In 2015, Sonny took a turn towards productions for influencers and YouTubers, contributing to multiple #1 charting songs such as Dee’s \"You\", \"Holding On\" and \"This Christmas\". Meanwhile, four of his songs became a viral success with over 4 Billion views on YouTube. Sonny teamed up with renowned artist Mike Williams to co-create the official \"DLDK Amsterdam 2017 anthem\", \"Waiting For You\" by Sem Vox, marking a standout moment in the event's history Sonny showcased his versatility by contributing to a range of tracks that reflect diverse musical styles. His work on \"Allebei Kwijt\" by Yung Volwassen brought a unique energy to the Dutch music scene. In 2024, Sonny co-wrote and co-produced the highly anticipated single \"Gravity,\" by world-renowned DJ Martin Garrix in collaboration with Sem Vox, featuring Jaimes. \"Gravity\" was first premiered in March 2024 by Martin Garrix at Ultra Music Festival in Miami, FL and was released on October 18th, 2024. By working alongside some of the biggest names in the electronic music industry, Sonny further solidified his position as a key player in shaping the global dance music landscape. Sonny performed his first big show at worldwide dance festival “Don't Let Daddy Know” making his debut in the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam in 2016 alongside Steve Angello, Tiësto, R3hab and Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano. His first international performance followed at “Don't Let Daddy Know” in Edinburgh, Scotland alongside Nicky Romero, Showtek, and Laidback Luke.
