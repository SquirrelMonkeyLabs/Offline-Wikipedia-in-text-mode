 "text": "Surface-mount technology (SMT) uses electronic devices that are made to be placed directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Examples of surface-mount devices are resistors, capacitors, LEDs and integrated circuits. Surface mounted devices are generally smaller than those used in the older through-hole technology, which need longer leads and holes in the circuit board. == Other websites == * Category:Electronics",
