 "text": "The rail transport system in Denmark has 2,633 km of railway lines. The Copenhagen S-train network, the main line Helsing√∏r-Copenhagen-Padborg (at the German border), and the Lunderskov-Esbjerg line are electrified. Most traffic is on passenger trains. There is also a lot of cargo that goes between Sweden and Germany. Maintenance work on most Danish railway lines is done by Banedanmark, a state-owned company that also allocates tracks for train operators. Most passenger trains are operated by DSB, with Arriva and Nordjyske Jernbaner operating on some lines in Jutland. Freight transport is mainly done by DB Schenker Rail, although other operators take care of a significant portion of the local traffic. Denmark is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Denmark is 86. ==References==",
