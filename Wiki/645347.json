 "text": "The Fabian strategy is a military strategy in which one side avoids the other and avoids pitched battles and frontal assaults. The object is to wear down the opponent by a \"war of attrition\" and to harass the enemy by skirmishes to weaken it, disrupt its supply and affect its morale. The strategy is employed by a side that believes that time is on its side, but it may also be adopted when no other strategy is possible. Category:War",
