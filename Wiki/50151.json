Another way to calculate the modern value to a talent of money is compare it with modern military pay. During the Peloponnesian war in Ancient Greece, a talent was the amount of silver needed to pay the entire crew of a trireme for one month. Mercenaries were commonly paid one drachma for every day of service, which was a good salary in those days. 6,000 drachma made a talent. In Revelation 16:21, the talent is used as a weight for hail being poured forth from heaven and dropping on mankind as punishment in the end times: \"And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.\" (King James Bible) Various definitions are provided in different translations: * New International Version: a footnote says \"Talent: 75 or 100 pounds.\" * New Living Translation: text reads \"weighing as much as seventy-five pounds\". * English Standard Version: text reads \"about one hundred pounds each\".
