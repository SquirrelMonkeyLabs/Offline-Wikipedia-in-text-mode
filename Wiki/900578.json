They sing for the females while they swim. The female frogs lay eggs that float on the water. The tadpoles are black in color. ==Food== This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It eats many kinds of insects and also termites. ==Tarantulas== On Rameshwaran Island near India, scientists have seen this frog live in the same burrows as Poecilotheria hanumavilasumica tarantula spiders.

Scientists have seen this species of tarantula eating this species of frog. ==Threats== This frog can die from the chemicals that human beings put in the environment. These are chemicals that humans use on purpose to kill pests, make crops grow, and also pollution. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
