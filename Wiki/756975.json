 "text": "Gruschwitz Textilwerke AG is a textile industry company based in Leutkirch im Allgäu in Baden-Württemberg in Germany. == Beginnings == The company was founded in 1816 in the Silesian Nowa Sól () by Johann David Gruschwitz, it emerged from an operation of the Moravian Church. In 1847, Gruschwitz left the company, which his sons Heinrich Gruschwitz (1816–1885) and Alexander Gruschwitz (1819–1888) successfully continued under the company JD Gruschwitz & Söhne oHG . The company was converted into Gruschwitz Textilwerke AG in 1906, in whose management the Doherr families (Doherr-Gruschwitz) and von Treskow were represented as Gruschwitz descendants. During the First World War, Gruschwitz employed over 3,500 people. At the end of the Second World War, all Gruschwitz factories were in the Red Army's sphere of influence and were expropriated without compensation as a Soviet joint stock company . The last 4,000 employees became unemployed. With the help of a few old employees, Franz Alexander Doherr-Gruschwitz opened a small twisted yarn production facility in Neu-Ulm, Bavaria, in 1950 in initially rented rooms. == Recent history == In 2004 Gruschwitz moved from Neu-Ulm to Leutkirch im Allgäu after the company had previously taken over two other companies in the textile industry (Fritz Zorn GmbH & Co. KG, Leutkirch and Lozetex GmbH Tech-Twists, Winterlingen). In 2005, the operative business was completely outsourced to Gruschwitz GmbH Tech-Twists, also located in Leutkirch im Allgäu. This 100% subsidiary is a leader in the development and production of technical threads, yarns and sewing threads in Western Europe.Florian Langenscheidt, Bernd Venohr (Hrsg.): Lexikon der deutschen Weltmarktführer.

Both simple natural fibers and modern man-made fibers are processed as raw materials.
