 "text": "Pussy Riot is a Russian feminist punk rock protest group of eleven women. The group was formed in August 2011 in Moscow. Three members of the group (Yekaterina Samutsevich, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, and Maria Alyokhina) were put in prison for a protest they did at a cathedral in Moscow against Vladimir Putin. Yekaterina Samutsevich was let out of prison in September 2012 after her appeal succeeded. There were protests around the world by people who thought that it was wrong for Pussy Riot members to be put in prison. Lots of famous people said that they should be released including Madonna. On December 23, 2013, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were let out. Other members declared that Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina could not be Pussy Riot members because they showed their faces on US television.Pussy Riot duo sacked by bandmates after us tv appearance ; Independent ==Music== Pussy Riot have released twenty songs, including an album called xxx (styled in lower capitals) . ==Documentary== In January 2013 a documentary about Pussy Riot called Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer was released.
