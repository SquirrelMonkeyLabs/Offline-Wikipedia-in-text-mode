 "text": "The 1988 Nova Scotia general election was held on September 6, 1988 to elect members of the 55th House of Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada. It was won by the Progressive Conservative party. John Dunsworth, who would later gain fame for playing alcoholic trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey on the TV series Trailer Park Boys, stood as the NDP candidate in Halifax Bedford Basin. He finished in third place with a little over 19% of the vote. His underdog campaign was later the subject of a short documentary. ==Results== ===Results by party=== Party Leader 1984 Seats won % change Popular vote (%) Progressive Conservative John Buchanan 42 28 -33.3% 204,150 43.4% Liberal Vince MacLean 6 21 +250% 186,007 39.6% New Democratic Alexa McDonough 3 2 -33.3% 74,038 15.8% Other Other 1 1 5,638 1.2% Total Seats 52 52 469,833 100% * Vote share included in \"other\" ==References== * * Category:1988 elections Category:1980s elections in Nova Scotia Category:General elections in Canada",
