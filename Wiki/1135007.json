 "text": "The Montane rocket frog (Hyloxalus alessandroi) is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== Scientists have seen this frog in two places, about 100 km apart: San Pedro, Kos√±ipata in the Cusco Region and San Gaban in the Puno Region. This frog is awake during the day and it lives near streams in cloud forests that have never been cut down. Scientists saw this frog between 820 and 1480 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in one protected park: Manu National Park. ==Young== Scientists think this frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. Scientists have seen the male frogs calling to female frogs. The male frogs sit near streams, on rocks, or on dead plants or they hide in the plants. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. They think many frogs died from the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Scientists have not seen the frog in Manu National Park since 1999. Scientists have not looked for the frog in San Gaban in many years. There, people change the places where the frog lives to make farms, for example coffee farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
