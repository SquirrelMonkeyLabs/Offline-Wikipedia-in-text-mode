 "text": "Hydric brooding is something that frogs do to their eggs. Not all amphibian animals lay eggs in the water. Some lay eggs on land. Unlike reptile and bird eggs, which have a special layer that stops them from losing too much water too fast, amphibian eggs can become dry and die. For example, the male poison arrow frog Phyllobates vittatus sits on top of his eggs and puts liquid from his bladder on them. He does not stay with the eggs the whole time. Instead, he visits them three times each day. ==References== Category:Reproductive system Category:Amphibians",
