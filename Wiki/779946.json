In January 2020, various news channels reported his true identity is Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli al-Salbi (). His appointment by a shura council was announced by ISIL media on 31 October 2019, less than a week after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Until his death, the U.S. Rewards for Justice Program offered up to $10 million reward to information that could get him arrested and sent to prison. On 3 February 2022, it was reported by a U.S. official that al-Hashimi killed himself and members of his family by triggering a bomb during a raid by the United States Army. Abu al-Hasan al- Hashimi al-Qurashi replaced him as the leader of ISIS. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1976 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Caliphs Category:Iraqi politicians Category:Islamic State people Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:Suicide bombings in the 2020s Category:Suicide in 2022 Category:Al-Qaeda people Category:Iraqi military people Category:Deaths by suicide bomber Category:Prisoners of war Category:War criminals Category:Iraqi criminals",
