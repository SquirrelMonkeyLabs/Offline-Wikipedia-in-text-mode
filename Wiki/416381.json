 "text": "Punial was a princely state of the British Raj. The British called it a \"Special Political District\" of the Gilgit Agency. It was located in the northwest part of the former Northern Areas. It existed until 1974. This area and other neighbouring states were never ruled directly by Kashmir and Jammu. == History == The official name of the state was the Punial State (Takht-e- Punial). The term \"Punial\" comes from the Shina language, where it means both \"fertile land\" and \"bucket of fruits.\" The region is closely connected to the neighboring areas of the Gilgit Agency. Historically, the inhabitants of Punial were linked to the Arian belief system of Mazdaism (آتش پرست), which influenced the area's early cultural identity. Over time, the Shina language became deeply ingrained in the local culture, serving as the primary means of communication and unity among the people. In ancient times, Punial had a notable Hindu presence, contributing to its rich cultural diversity. Following the era of Dardistan, the Indo-Aryans settled in Gilgit-Baltistan, and the entire population of Punial gradually converted to Buddhism, marking a significant shift in the region's religious and cultural landscape. Before the establishment of the Punial rajas, governance was based on a tribal head system, with various tribal leaders overseeing their respective groups. Key figures like Shout, Nago, and other tribal heads played important roles in early governance. The Burusue family from Chitral (1780 - 1856) eventually emerged as a dominant ruling family, establishing Punial as an independent state. The Imperial Ayasho Dynasty of Punial (1885 - 1974) was the last ruling family that governed Punial and its neighboring states, including Gupis, Yasin, Ishkoman, and Western Nagar. To consolidate power, they overthrew the Burush, Katoor, and Gushpur dynasties, ultimately gaining complete control. Shehzada Sameer Shah Ayasho, also known as Shehzada Mir Sameer Ali Shah Ayasho, is a prominent descendant of the Imperial Ayasho House of Punial. He is widely recognized as the current imperial crown prince of the family and is commonly referred to in the region as the Prince of Punial. The Imperial Ayasho Dynasty of Punial, established by Crown Prince Mir Bukhtawar Shah of Hunza State, emerged following his betrayal by his half-brother, Mir Ghazan Khan and the state officials, who seized the throne of Hunza. As a result, Bukhtawar Shah sought refuge in Ishkoman, aligning himself with the Syed Family of Ishkoman, widely known as the Pir’s Family, the ancestors of Pir Syed Karam Ali Shah. == Ruling Families Timeline == === Pre - Dynasty's (1500 - 1645) === * During the early period of regional governance, the area was ruled by various tribal leaders who exercised authority over different territories. Among these factions, the Nago clan emerged as one of the most prominent and influential ruling groups. The Nago clan played a pivotal role in shaping the political and social landscape of the region, establishing their dominance through strategic alliances, military campaigns, and governance. === Gushpur Dynasty (1645 - 1780) === * The first prominent ruling family to emerge from Yasin was the Gushpur dynasty, known as the Yasin Rajas. They established their authority over the region and eventually transformed the state into an independent Wazarat, solidifying their rule and influence in the area. === Burusue Dynasty (1780 - 1856) === * The Burush Family was the first prominent ruling dynasty of Punial, establishing its seat of power in Gahkuch. The earliest known ruler, Raja Sifat Bahadur, is recognized for consolidating the family's authority in the region. The dynasty claimed descent from Chitral and played a significant role in shaping the political structure of Punial during its early history. === Katoor Dynasty (1856 - 1885) === * The Katoor Dynasty of Chitral expanded into the region under the rule of Mehtar Aman ul-Mulk, who conquered Yasin and Gupis before advancing into Punial, extending his domain to the city of Sher Qilla. The Katoor rulers and their descendants maintained control over Sher Qilla, with the last ruler, Raja Jan Alam (Nasir ul-Din), governing until 1974. === Ayasho Dynasty (1885 - 1974) === * The Ayasho Dynasty of Punial originated from Hunza, established by Mir Bukhtawar Shah, the crown prince of Hunza. They chose Gahkuch as their seat of power. With the help of the Syed Family of Ishkoman, they expanded their influence and promoted Ismaili dawa in the region. The Ayasho family later conquered Yasin, Gupis, Ishkoman, and Western Nagar. The dynasty remained prominent until 1974, with the last ruler, Aqa of Punial being His Royal Highness Aqa Mayoon Ali Shah of Punial. The Ayasho family is known for conquering the largest area in Gilgit-Baltistan in a short period. == Religions timeline == === Mazdaism (800 - 1200) === * Zoroastrianism === Buddhism (1200 - 1400) === * Dardi === Hinduism (1400 - 1500) === * Sati === Shamanism (1500 - present) === * Danyal (Shina) * Bitan (Burushaski) === Islamism (1500 - present) === * Sunnism * Shiaism * Ismailism == References == Category:Pakistani princely states Category:Former subdivisions of Pakistan Category:1974 disestablishments Category:1970s disestablishments in Asia",
