 "text": "The Cardigans are a Swedish pop rock group that started in October 1992. Their debut studio album Emmerdale gave them very strong base in Sweden. However, it was not until their 1995 album Life was released that an international reputation was secured. Their popularity really soared in 1996 when the song Lovefool was released. They've carried other hit songs in addition to that. The group went on hiatus in 2006. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website Category:1990s Swedish music groups Category:2000s Swedish music groups Category:2010s Swedish music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Swedish rock music groups",
