 "text": "The Weißeritzkreis was a district (Kreis) in the south of the Free State of Saxony, Germany. It borders the Czech Republic. The district was created in 1994 when the two districts Dippoldiswalde and Freital were merged. It ended in 2008. During the flooding in August 2002 the river Weißeritz had to drain many times the normal amount of water, and a lot of buildings in the river valley - houses, streets and bridges were destroyed ==Partnerships== # Rottweil # Berchtesgadener Land # Göttingen # Zollernalbkreis == Coat of arms == The blue lines symbolise the two Weißeritz rivers, and their merging into a single river. The mining symbol in the bottom represents the old ore and coal mining tradition in the Ore Mountains. The tree stands for the rich forests in the district, and the lion to the right is the symbol of Meißen, as the area historically belonged to the margraviate of Meißen. ==Towns and municipalities== Towns Municipalities # Altenberg # Dippoldiswalde # Freital # Geising # Glashütte # Rabenau # Tharandt # Wilsdruff # Bannewitz # Dorfhain # Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau # Hermsdorf # Höckendorf # Kreischa # Pretzschendorf # Schmiedeberg == Other websites == * Official website (German) * Website about the 2002 Flooding (German) Category:2008 disestablishments in Germany",
