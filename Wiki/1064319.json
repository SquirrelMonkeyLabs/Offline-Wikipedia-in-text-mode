 "text": "Christopher Mark Sievey (born 2 April 1953) was an English singer, musician and record producer, known for the lead singer and guitarist of his backing band the Freshies in the late 1970s and early 1980s and for his comic persona Frank Sidebottom from 1982 onwards. Sievey, under the guise of Sidebottom, made regular appearances on North West television throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, even becoming a reporter for Granada Reports. Later, he presented Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show in B/W for the Manchester-based television station Channel M. Throughout his career, Sidebottom made appearances on radio stations such as Manchester's Piccadilly Radio and on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 5, alongside Mark and Lard. == Early life and career (1953–1978) == Sievey grew up in Salford, Manchester, England. In 1967, when he was 14, Sievey began writing and recording his own music, and by the age of 15 was playing in local bands. In 1969, he hitch-hiked to London with his brother, staging a sit-in at the Apple Records HQ, demanding to see one of The Beatles. When they were asked to leave they insisted on recording something, and were booked into the studio after playing a song to head of A&R; Tony King. Sievey subsequently recorded several demos, which he sent to record companies, receiving many rejection letters which he later compiled into a book. He was an attendee to saw Dr. Feelgood and Kilburn and the High Roads concert in December 1974. Unable to get a deal, he set up his own punk band Bee Knees in November 1976. Bee Knees released two albums in June 1977 and November 1977, Girl in My Blue Jeans and All Sleeps Secrets and their debut single I'm Her Man in May 1977. Bee Knees disbanded in February 1978. In March 1978, Sievey, along with musician for Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias and John Cooper Clarke, John Scott and record producer Martin Hannett, provided lyrics for \"Jilted John\" a song featuring music performed by post-punk performer and comedian Jilted John. == Chris Sievey & The Freshies (1978–1982) == In March 16, 1978, Sievey formed his backing band the Freshies, with Barry Spencer (born 1956; vocals, guitar), Rick Maunder (born 1955; vocals, bass), and Paul Whittle (born 1955; drums). They supporting Elvis Costello on his UK tour in March to April 1978. In June 1978, He signed to Stiff Records. Invited by Dave Robinson to participate in the forthcoming Be Stiff Route '78 Tour in 1978, Sievey quickly recorded his first album for Stiff, Rough 'N' Ready, was produced by Pete Shelley, which contained \"I'm in Love with the Girl on the Certain Manchester Megastore Checkout Desk\", \"Heart to Heart\", and another Top 20 hit, \"No Money\". Sievey's musical style combined his own quirky inventions with punk and power pop styles. A string of singles and four albums were released between 1978 and 1981. Chris Sievey's biggest UK hit was \"I'm in Love with the Girl on the Certain Manchester Megastore Checkout Desk\", released initially on Stiff label (BUY 36). The record peaked at No 34 in November 1978. They had commercial success in England with \"Yellow Spot\" and \"No Money\". Sievey released further singles, \"Wrap Up the Rockets\" and \"I Can't Get Bouncing Babies\", and also although commercially successful in England, they failed to make the national charts. The following year he had a solo release, \"Camouflage\", with the A-side a song, and the B-side being computer programming. == Filmography == Year Title Role Director(s) Notes 1985 TX: Episode 16 Actor, as \"Frank Sidebottom\" Richard Bradley & Tim Sullivan TV appearance, debut of Frank Sidebottom 1986 No 73: Sit Janie Grace TV appearance 1987 No 73 (Series 7) Unknown TV show No 73 (Series 8) Graeme Matthews 1988 7T3 Actor, as \"Frank Sidebottom\", & \"Reg\" Unknown 1989 Kazuko's Karaoke Klub: 15 July 1989 Actor, as \"Frank Sidebottom\" TV appearance 1991 Motormouth (Series 4) Actor, as \"Frank Sidebottom\" & \"Little Frank\".
