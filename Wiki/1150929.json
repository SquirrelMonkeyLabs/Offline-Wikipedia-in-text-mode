Since no presidential candidate won an absolute majority in the first round of voting, a runoff took place on 30 November. Current President José Mujica was unable to run for another consecutive terms. The majority Broad Front Party nominated Mujica's predecessor, Tabaré Vázquez, as its candidate. Vázquez advanced to the runoff with National Party candidate Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou, son of former president Luis Alberto Lacalle de Herrera. In the runoff, Vázquez was elected in a landslide victory. The Broad Front also kept its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, winning 50 of the 99 seats. ==References== Category:21st century in Uruguay Category:2010s in South America Category:2014 elections Category:Elections in Uruguay Category:October 2014 events Category:November 2014 events",
