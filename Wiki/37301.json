 "text": "Sharpie is a line of permanent marker pens in the United States and the United Kingdom that are manufactured by Newell Brands. Once produced by the company Sanford, Newell Brands took over the Sharpie and Sanford lines in 1999. Sharpie markers are made with many tips. The most common and popular is the Fine tip. Other tips include Micro Point, Ultra Fine Point, Extra Fine Point, Brush Tip, Chisel Tip, Magnum Tip and Retractable Tip. There have been 124 fine point colors, and 91 ultra fine point colors made ever since 1964. Some colors are discontinued, others are considered \"core\" or widely available, and others have a different formulation that makes them different from other colors. The currently known packs that have a different formulation are Metallics, Neons, and Touch-Ups. Over the years, some of the colors have had their ink color changed in production for unknown reasons, making them very inconsistent. Sharpie's Motto is \"We are THE BOLD ORIGINAL, genuine article, and cultural icon of Permanent Markers.\" ==Colors== Colors range across the spectrum including neon and metallics as well. The hex code is an approximate for the actual color.
