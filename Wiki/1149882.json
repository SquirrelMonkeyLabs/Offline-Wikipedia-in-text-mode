 "text": "An emirp is a type of prime number that, when its digits are reversed, still results in a prime number, but the reversed number must be different from the original one. The word \"emirp\" comes from the word \"prime\" spelled backwards. == Example: == * 13 is an emirp because when reversed, it becomes 31, which is also a prime number. * 17 is an emirp because its reverse, 71, is also prime. == Properties of Emirps: == * An emirp is always a two-digit or larger prime number. * An emirp is not a palindrome (a number that is the same forwards and backwards). For example, 131 is not an emirp because it is the same when reversed. * The smallest emirp is 13. == List of emirps == (13, 31), (17, 71), (37, 73), (79, 97), (107, 701), (113, 311), (149, 941), (157, 751), (179, 971), (199, 991), (337, 733), (347, 741), (359, 953), (389, 983), (709, 907), (739, 937), (769, 967), (1009, 9001), (1021, 1201), (1031, 1301), (1033, 3301), (1061, 1601), (1069, 9601), (1091, 1901), (1097, 7901), (1103, 3011), (1109, 9011), (1151, 1511), (1153, 3511), (1181, 1811), (1193, 3911), (1213, 3121), (1217, 7121), (1223, 3221), (1229, 9221), (1231, 1321), (1237, 7321), (1249, 9421), (1259, 9521), (1279, 9721), (1283, 3821), (1381, 1831), (1399, 9931), (1409, 9041), (1429, 9241), (1439, 9341), (1453, 3541), (1471, 1741), (1487, 7841), (1499, 9941), (1523, 3251), (1559, 9551), (1583, 3851), (1597, 7951), (1619, 9161), (1657, 7561), (1669, 9661), (1723, 3271), (1733, 3371), (1753, 3571), (1789, 9871), (1847, 7481), (1867, 7681), (1879, 9781), (1913, 3191), (1933, 3391), (1949, 9491), (1979, 9791), etc... == Conclusion == Emirps are part of a special group of numbers called \"reversible primes,\" and they are studied in number theory, a branch of mathematics.
