This technology makes use of pixels mounted on each segment RGB of the display, such that each pixel is illuminated independently. This differs from the usual liquid crystal display which produces mixed white light by a backlight and then filters out the unwanted colors at each pixel. Sony unveiled Crystal LED display technology in the CES 2012. ==Related pages== * LED * Organic light- emitting diode == References == Category:Display technology",
