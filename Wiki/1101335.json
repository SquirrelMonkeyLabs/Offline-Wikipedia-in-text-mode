 "text": "The light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), often called LBAM, is a species of tortricid leafroller measuring about Â¼ inch long, which curls leaves to create shelters. Originally from Australia, LBAM has spread to various regions including New Zealand, Hawaii, Ireland, New Caledonia, and Great Britain. In March 2007, LBAM was confirmed to be present in California, leading to restrictions on the shipment of plant materials from California to other states in the USA, as well as within California from infested counties to non-infested areas. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has classified LBAM as a Class A pest and has initiated an eradication program primarily utilizing mating disruption pheromones and insecticide treatments. Adults of this species exhibit a light brown to yellowish hue, often adorned with varying degrees of darker brown patterning, boasting a wingspan ranging from . Notably, females tend to surpass males in size, typically displaying less pronounced markings; however, a distinctive spot is frequently observable when their wings are in a closed position. Eggs, characterized by their pale white coloration, are laid in clusters with a slight overlap, typically containing 20 to 50 eggs per group. Upon reaching maturity, larvae adopt a green coloration and measure approximately in length. Despite bearing a superficial resemblance to larvae of other indigenous tortricid species, confirming their identity often necessitates DNA analysis. Pupae of this species are typically brown in color and measure around in length. ==References== Category:Animals of Australia Category:Animals of New Zealand Category:Moths",
