 "text": "Live in Texas is Linkin Park's first live album and third DVD (after Frat Party at the Pankake Festival and The Making of Meteora), released on November 18, 2003. ==About the album== The DVD comes with a bonus CD that features twelve of the songs from the DVD. The other five live tracks can be found on the Linkin Park Underground V3.0 CD. The audio on the CD is mixed differently than the DVD audio. The DVD/CD comes in two versions: a CD box and, although harder to find, a DVD box. The concert footage was filmed on August 2 and August 3 during the 2003 Summer Sanitarium Tour at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas and Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas. The video footage is comprised of the audio from the Dallas show and video from both the Houston and Dallas shows; because of this, the band had to wear the same clothes on two shows, although there are still noticeable differences. For example, Mike Shinoda could be seen wearing two similar but different shirts, Brad Delson's guitar sometimes changes multiple times in the middle of songs from a red PRS to a black Ibanez, even though there is no break in the guitar, as well as lead singer Chester Bennington's shirt drenched in sweat and completely dry the next time he's shown on screen. ==Tracks== ===CD=== ;Enhanced CD Extras * Website toolkit * Merchandise * Screensaver * Web links ===DVD=== #\"Don't Stay\" #\"Somewhere I Belong\" #\"Lying from You\" #\"Papercut\" #\"Points of Authority\" #\"Runaway\" #\"Faint\" #\"From the Inside\" #\"Figure.09\" #\"With You\" #\"By Myself\" #\"P5hng Me A*wy\" #\"Numb\" #\"Crawling\" #\"In the End\" #\"A Place for My Head\" #\"One Step Closer\" (contains verses from \"1stp Klosr\") Category:2003 albums Category:Linkin Park albums",
