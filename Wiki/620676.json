Despite his young age, people thought he could win a medal at the 2018 Winter Games. During the 2017-2018 snowboarding season, his results were not consistent but his speed was very good. The lack of consistency was why some people thought he might not be able to win gold. === Schedule and results === The program has snowboard cross starting on 12 March, running from 10:30 AM to 5:00 PM for all classes for both men and women.
