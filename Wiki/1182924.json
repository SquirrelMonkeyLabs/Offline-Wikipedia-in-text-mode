 "text": "The Kaie rock frog (Anomaloglossus kaiei) is a frog. Scientists found it in Guyana and they think it might also live in Brazil. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground. People have seen this frog in forests that have never been cut or burned and in forests that are growing back. Scientists saw it between 150 and 1060 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in Kaieteur National Park. ==Young== The female frog takes care of the tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Most of these frogs live in a place where most people do not go, but other people dig for gold and diamonds in the ground. This can change the place where the frog lives too much for it to live there. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
