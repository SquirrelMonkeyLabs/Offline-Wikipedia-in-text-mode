 "text": "\"Getting Better\" is a song written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon, based on an original idea by McCartney. It was recorded by The Beatles for the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. == Lennon on the roof == One of the recording sessions for \"Getting Better\" is famous for an incident involving Lennon. During the 21 March 1967 session in which producer George Martin added a piano solo, Lennon complained that he did not feel well and could not focus. He had accidentally taken LSD when he meant to take an upper. Unaware of the mistake, Martin took him up to the roof of Abbey Road Studio for some fresh air, and returned to Studio Two where McCartney and Harrison were waiting. They knew why Lennon was not well, and upon hearing where Lennon was, rushed to the roof to retrieve him and prevent a possible accident. ==Personnel== * Paul McCartney – double-tracked vocal, bass * John Lennon – backing vocal, lead guitar * George Harrison – backing vocals, lead guitar, tambura * Ringo Starr – drums, congas * George Martin – piano, pianette :Personnel per Ian MacDonald ==Notes== ==Other websites== * * * * * * * * * Category:The Beatles songs Category:1967 songs",
