 "text": "The Occupation of Alcatraz (November 20, 1969 – June 11, 1971) was a protest where 89 Native Americans and other people occupied Alcatraz Island. At one point, the protest had 400 people. It was led by Richard Oakes, LaNada War Jack, and others. The group lived on the island until the United States government made them leave. The group of protesters named themselves the Indians of All Tribes (IOAT). They said that, because of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (a treaty made between the United States and Lakota tribe), all of the land that was owned by the government that was not being used should be given to Native Americans. Alcatraz stopped being used as a prison in 1963, so many Red Power protestors thought it should be taken by Native Americans. and The Occupation of Alcatraz changed how the United States government made laws about Native Americans for a short time. It was an important Native American protest, and inspired other protests.Kotlowski, Dean J. \"Alcatraz, Wounded Knee, and Beyond: The Nixon and Ford Administrations Respond to Native American Protest,\" Pacific Historical Review, 72(2):201–227. Richard Oakes was killed in 1972. The American Indian Movement was later targeted by the FBI. == References == Category:20th-century protests Category:Native Americans",
