 "text": "Princess Royal is a title often given by the reigning British King or Queen to his or her eldest daughter. The title is a gift of the monarch, unlike Prince of Wales which is always given to the eldest son There can only be one Princess Royal at a time, so Elizabeth II never held the title because her aunt, Princess Mary was already called Princess Royal. ==List of Princesses Royal== The following is a full list of women officially called \"Princess Royal\": Order Name dates Princess Royal from (date) to (date) Parent Date married Husband dates Notes 1 Mary, Princess Royal 1631–1660 1642–1660 Charles I 1600–1649 1641 William II, Prince of Orange 1626–1650 2 Anne, Princess Royal 1709–1759 1727–1759 George II 1683–1760 1734 William IV, Prince of Orange 1711–1751 3 Charlotte, Princess Royal 1766–1828 1789–1828 George III 1738–1820 1797 Frederick I of Württemberg 1754–1816 4 Victoria, Princess Royal 1840–1901 1841–1901 Victoria 1819–1901 1858 Friedrich III of Germany 1831–1888 Heiress presumptive 1840–1841 5 Louise, Princess Royal 1867–1931 1905–1931 Edward VII 1841–1910 1889 Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife 1849–1912 6 Mary, Princess Royal 1897–1965 1932–1965 George V 1865–1936 1922 Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood 1882–1947 7 Anne, Princess Royal 1950– 1987–present Elizabeth II 1926– 1973–1992 Mark Phillips 1948- 1992 Timothy Laurence 1955– Princess Louisa Maria (1692–1712), the last daughter of King James II (d. 1701), was born after he lost his crown in the Glorious Revolution.
