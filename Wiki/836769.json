 "text": "\"Everglow\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay. It is the fourth track from their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams. The song features uncredited guest vocals by Gwyneth Paltrow. At the time, Paltrow was married to Coldplay's lead singer, Chris Martin. The track was first performed during Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show on 26 November 2015. It was released as a promotional single for the album on 27 November 2015. On 11 November 2016 it was released digitally as the fifth single proper from the album, in a newly recorded version. This version was inspired by Martin's unrehearsed solo performance of the song at the recent Glastonbury Festival. This version ends with a sample of Muhammad Ali's 1977 speech in Newcastle upon Tyne. ==References== Category:2010s ballads Category:2015 songs Category:Coldplay songs Category:Rock ballads",
