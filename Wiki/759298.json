Uzbekistan's Health Ministry has a list of people who were in contact with the victim, with plans to quarantine them. After the case was announced, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced a state of emergency in Kazakhstan, and promptly closed the border with Uzbekistan. Two days before the first case of coronavirus, Uzbekistan suspended flights to France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. On 22 March 2020, Uzbekistan ordered companies in Tashkent to do remote working, as well as making protective masks mandatory. On March 27, 2020, the first death was reported in the country, who was a 72-year-old woman living in Namangan. She was infected by her daughter who returned from Turkey on 12 March 2020.
