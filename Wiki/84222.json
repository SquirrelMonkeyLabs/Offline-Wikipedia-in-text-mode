 "text": "In professional education, learning by teaching means a method that trains pupils and students to prepare and to teach lessons, or parts of lessons. This method is designed to teach them better understanding than any method where the teacher talks to the pupils and gives them work they have to prepare. Learning by teaching should not be confused with presentations or lectures by students, because they have to do much more. They have to choose their own methods and didactic approaches in teaching classmates that subject. And it is something else than tutoring, because the teacher gives continuous support when they prepare teaching. == References == * Alan Gartner, Mary Conway Kohler, Frank Riessman: Children teach children.
