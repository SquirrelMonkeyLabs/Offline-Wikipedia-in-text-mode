The group was founded in the late 1980s and is named after Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a Syrian preacher and nationalist leader who played a role in the Arab anti-colonial struggle in the early 20th century. The Brigades have been involved in conflicts with Israel. Al-Qassam spokesperson, Abu Obaida stated in a public speech in 2023 during the Israeli war on Gaza that 85% of their recruits are orphans who wish for revenge whose parents were killed by the Israeli Forces. == Related pages == * First Intifada * Al-Quds Brigades * Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine * Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine == Notes == ==References== Category:Palestine Category:Gaza Strip Category:Arabâ€“Israeli conflict Category:National liberation movements Category:Hamas Category:Nationalist organizations in Palestine Category:Islamist militant groups Category:Military wings of political parties Category:Palestinian resistance factions",
