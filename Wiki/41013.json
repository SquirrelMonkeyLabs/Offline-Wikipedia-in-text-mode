In 1953, an Austrian German named Hermann Buhl was the first to climb it. Nanga Parbat is in the west of the Himalayas, and is the most western of the mountains higher than eight thousand meters. It lies just south of the Indus River, in the Astore District of the Northern Areas in the region of Kashmir. Not far to the north is the western end of the Karakoram mountains. Nanga Parbat is the highest peak in the Nanga Parbat Range. The range covers an area of in length and in width. In the east it joins the Pir Panjal Range. The steep incline of its peak that rises above the ground far below makes Nanga Parbat a difficult and dangerous climb. Many deaths in the mid and early 20th century gave it the nickname of \"killer mountain\". ==References == == Other websites == *A mountain list ranked by local relief and steepness showing Nanga Parbat as the steepest *Pictures from a winter expedition in 2013 Category:Himalayas Category:Mountains of Gilgit- Baltistan",
