 "text": "John Middleton was an English giant who was born in the village of Hale and is commonly known as the Childe of Hale. He was claimed to be 9 feet 3 inches (2.82 m) tall, and legend tells that he slept with his feet out of the window of his small house, and stories credit him with great strength. He was employed as a bodyguard by the sheriff of Lancashire. ==History== Middleton was born in the village of Hale, near Liverpool. According to modern accounts and his gravestone, he grew to the height of and slept with his feet hanging out the window of his house. Because of his size the landlord and sheriff of Lancashire, Gilbert Ireland, hired him as a bodyguard. When King James I stopped by in 1617 to knight Ireland he heard about Middleton and invited both of them to the court, which they accepted in 1620. Middleton beat the King's champion in wrestling and in doing so broke the man's thumb. He received Â£20 which was a large amount of money in those times. Jealous of his wealth, Middleton's companions mugged him or cheated him out of his money while he was returning to Hale. Middleton died very poor in 1623. He was buried in the cemetery of St Mary's Church in Hale. His gravestone reads, \"Here lyeth the bodie of John Middleton the Childe of Hale. Nine feet three. Borne 1578 Dyede 1623.\" He is likely one of the tallest people in history. If these height markings are accurate, he would go past Robert Wadlow's height of . == Influence == There have been many local uses and memorials of honor of Middleton; a pub in Hale, named The Childe of Hale, has a copy of the Brasenose College portrait as its sign. In 1996 a large tree trunk opposite the church was carved with representations of John Middleton, Hale Lighthouse and other local symbols. In 2011, because of disease and in the interests of public safety the tree trunk was removed by Halton Borough Council. In April 2013, the wooden sculpture was replaced by a bronze statue tall by sculptor Diane Gorvin. == Portraits == Brasenose College in Oxford possesses a life- sized portrait, two smaller paintings and two life-sized representations of his hands. Another life-sized portrait can be seen at Speke Hall in Liverpool, a National Trust property. Although he was said to be tall, some experts suggested that he was only tall, believing his hands were not measured accurately according to records. However, his remains were supposed to be removed from his grave during the Victorian era but were worked out to about 9'3\". ==Childe of Hale Trail== Speke Hall, near Hale, incorporates a natural area with trees showing his house, feet, hands and other items. ==Gallery== File:Childe of Hale, Hale.jpg|Bronze sculpture of the Childe of Hale File:Grave of John Middleton, Childe of Hale 2.jpg|Grave at St Mary's Church File:Childe of Hale - geograph.org.uk - 40602.jpg|A wooden sculpture before now opposite the church but now removed File:14 Church End, Hale.jpg|14 Church End, Hale, Middleton's supposed birthplace File:Childe of hale at speke hall.jpg|Idea of how Middleton's house looks like located at Speke Hall.
