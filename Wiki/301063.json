Domingo Rivera of Tejano Nation believed every song on Dulce Amor was horrible. Rivera stated that he did not like not even one song.

Rivera then stated the album was \"out of date\" even when it was released in 1988. Sophia Vargas of Tejano Weekly believed that \"Dulce Amor\" was not Selena's best of work.
