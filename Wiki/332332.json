 "text": "In Search of the Castaways is a 1962 Walt Disney Productions movie. It stars Hayley Mills, George Sanders, and Maurice Chevalier. The movie was directed by Robert Stevenson. It was based on Jules Verne's 1868 adventure novel Captain Grant's Children. The movie was Mills's third of six movies for the Disney Studios. The movie was a box office hit. The Sherman brothers (Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman) wrote the songs \"Castaway\", \"Merci Beaucoup\", \"Let's Climb\", and \"Enjoy It\". Movie critic Hal Erickson wrote, \"[The movie] is a roller-coaster of a Disney film, making up in excitement what it lacks in credibility or coherence...the film was ideal Saturday-matinee fodder for the kiddie trade in 1963.\"New York Times Overview.
