 "text": "Nephrocalcinosis, once called Albrightâ€™s calcinosis, was initially described as a deposition of poorly soluble calcium salts in renal tissue as a result of hyperparathyroidism. Now, it refers to the buildup of both calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. It can cause sudden kidney injury. Nowadays, it is more appropriately used to describe diffusely fine calcium deposits of the kidney as seen in radiology. It is caused by various conditions and worsens with kidney dysfunction. These deposits eventually form a dense mass. In the early stages, nephrocalcinosis can be visualized on an x-ray as fine granular spots over the outlines of the kidneys. It is often found by chance with medullary sponge kidney on an abdominal x-ray. It can be severe enough to cause renal tubular acidosis or be caused by it, even to the point of causing end-stage kidney disease through disruption of renal tissue by the calcium deposits. == References == Category:Kidney diseases",
