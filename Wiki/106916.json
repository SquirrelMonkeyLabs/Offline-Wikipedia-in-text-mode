 "text": "Blood Red Shoes are an indie music band from Brighton, England. Blood Red Shoes's first album was Box of Secrets. There are two members: Laura-Mary Carter and Steven Ansell. They are often compared to \"The White Stripes\" due to the boy-girl drum-guitar setup, but they dislike this comparison and, indeed, the White Stripes themselves. Laura-Mary plays guitar while Steven plays drums. == Discography == === Singles === Title Release Date UK Singles Chart Album \"Victory for the Magpie\" (EP) 18 July 2005 - - \"Stitch Me Back / Meet Me at Eight\" (Double A-Side) 20 February 2006 - - \"A.D.H.D\" 15 May 2006 - - \"You Bring Me Down\" 20 November 2006 - I'll Be Your Eyes \"It's Getting Boring by the Sea\" 11 June 2007 - I'll Be Your Eyes \"I Wish I Was Someone Better\" 29 October 2007 - Box of Secrets \"You Bring Me Down\" (Re- Release) 04 February 2008 64 Box of Secrets \"Say Something, Say Anything\" 07 April 2008 79 Box of Secrets \"This Is Not for You\" 07 July 2008 - Box of Secrets === Albums === Title Release Date UK Album Chart Box of Secrets 14 April 2008 47 Fire like This 1 March 2010 95 In Time to Voices 24 July 2012 61 Blood Red Shoes 3 March 2014 49 Get Tragic 25 January 2019 58 === Compilations === * \"I'll Be Your Eyes\" - (V2 Records) 25 June 2007 Category:English rock bands Category:Indie bands Category:Organisations based in Brighton Category:Musical groups established in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in England",
