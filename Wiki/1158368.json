 "text": "The medieval Galician Kingdom, first known as the Suebian Kingdom of Gallaecia, started with the Germanic Suebi tribe in the 5th century.The first mention of it was in the 6th century, when Gregory of Tours called the country of the Germanic Suebi \"Gallaciensim regnum\". This kingdom once included parts of today's Asturias, León and Portugal. It had Christian traditions even during Islamic rule in nearby areas. As history was recorded over the centuries, some modern historians altered the narrative around the medieval Kingdom of Galicia. Instead of using the varied names found in historical documents —such as \"Gallaecia Regnum\", \"Gallitia\", \"Gallizia\", \"Galizuland\", \"ard Galika\", \"Yilliqiyya\", \"Jalikia\", etc. — they sometimes replaced these with \"Kingdom of Asturias\" or \"Kingdom of León\". For some Galician scholars, this change was part of an effort to create a continuous historical line leading to the later Kingdom of Castile and eventually to a unified Spain. Those scholars have criticized this view because it doesn't match the historical facts. Sometimes, even the historians who hold this view have admitted this issue. == Gallery == File:Galician-suevic- kingdom.png|Bishoprics of the Kingdom of Galicia. 6th century: Braga, Porto, Lamego, Coimbra, Dumio, Lugo, Ourense, Astorga, Iria, Britonia, Tui, Idaña, Viseu.
