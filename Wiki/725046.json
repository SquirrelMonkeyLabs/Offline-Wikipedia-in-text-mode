 "text": "The Ballon d'Or is a special award given to a football player every single year. It has been given since 1956 by a French news magazine called France Football. From 2010 to 2015, it was combined with another award called FIFA World Player of the Year, and together they were known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. However, in 2016, they separated again, and the award returned to its original name, the Ballon d'Or. FIFA also started giving its own separate award called The Best FIFA Men's Player. The Ballon d'Or was created by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran. It is given to the male player who is considered to have performed the best in the previous season. Football journalists used to do the voting for this award from 1956 to 2006. At first, it was only given to players from Europe and was called the European Footballer of the Year award. But in 1995, it was expanded to include players from any part of the world who have played for European clubs. After 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also allowed to vote. This made the award a global prize, and any professional football player from around the world became eligible to win it. In 2022, France Football changed some rules for the Ballon d'Or. They decided to give the award not for achievements in a calendar year but for a football season. They also made it so that only countries in the top 100 of the FIFA World Ranking could vote for the award. There is a different vote each year. It is for individual players to get recognised. Despite its popularity, critics have described the award as a \"popularity contest\", criticising its voting process and for systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.Why the Ballon d'Or is a waste of timeWhy the Ballon d’Or is stupid and quite possibly evilWeekly Why: FIFA's Ballon d'Or and the Absurdity of Glorifying Individual AwardsThe Ballon d'Or Is Stupid, But Mohamed Salah Deserves To Win It AnywayLos votos 'perdidos' del Balón de Oro == Winners == Key This indicates the Ballon d'Or winning player also won the FIFA World Player of the Year or The Best FIFA Men's Player award in the same year (available in 1991–2009 and from 2016) Year Rank Player Team Ballon d'Or (1956–2009) 1956 1st Stanley Matthews Blackpool 47 2nd Alfredo Di Stéfano Real Madrid 44 3rd Raymond Kopa Real Madrid 33 1957 1st Alfredo Di Stéfano Real Madrid 72 2nd Billy Wright Wolverhampton Wanderers 19 3rd Duncan Edwards Manchester United 16 Raymond Kopa Real Madrid 1958 1st Raymond Kopa Real Madrid 71 2nd Helmut Rahn Rot-Weiss Essen 40 3rd Just Fontaine Reims 23 1959 1st Alfredo Di Stéfano Real Madrid 80 2nd Raymond Kopa Reims 42 3rd John Charles Juventus 24 1960 1st Luis Suárez Barcelona 54 2nd Ferenc Puskás Real Madrid 37 3rd Uwe Seeler Hamburger SV 33 1961 1st Omar Sívori Juventus 46 2nd Luis Suárez Inter Milan 40 3rd Johnny Haynes Fulham 22 1962 1st Josef Masopust Dukla Prague 65 2nd Eusébio Benfica 53 3rd Karl-Heinz Schnellinger 1.
