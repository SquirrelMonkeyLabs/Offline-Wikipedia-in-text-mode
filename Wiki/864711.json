 "text": "Shyness is the feeling of apprehension, not being comfortable, or awkwardness especially when a person is around other people. This usually happens when someone is doing something or being somewhere they are not used to. This can be seen as the opposite of confidence. This fear of negative reactions such as being laughed at, humiliated, criticized or rejected can cause a shy person to retreat. Stronger forms of shyness can be known as anxiety. ==References== Category:Emotions",
