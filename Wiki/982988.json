 "text": "Commodity fetishism is an important concept in Marx's philosophy in his magnus opus The Capital. In his writings, he describes that people in capitalist systems are too focused on the end product people buy (a commodity) and forget to think about the processes that helped the commodity come about. For example, a ballpoint pen must go through material sourcing, designing, prototyping and manufacturing before it can be shipped and delivered to customers. Many people, including workers, took part in the production of the pen, and Marx believes that capitalist thinking takes people away from those processes and relationships which result in a commodity.
