When it started, Notts County, like most sports teams, were considered to be a \"gentlemen-only\" club.

Notts County is the oldest of the world's professional association football clubs (There are older professional clubs in other codes of football.) The club in the beginning played at Park Hollow at Nottingham Castle. In December 1864, the decision was made to play games against outside teams, and it was decided that the club needed to find a larger stadium. After playing at several places, The Magpies settled at Trent Bridge Cricket Ground in 1883. When the ground was used for Cricket, they played at Castle Ground or Nottingham Forest's Town Ground. The club moved to their current stadium, Meadow Lane, in 1910. ===Football League=== In 1888, Notts County, along with eleven other football clubs, became a founding member of The Football League.The Magpies Keith Warsop page 31 They finished their first league season in eleventh place.
