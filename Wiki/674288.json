 "text": "Lögberg, also named Law Rock, is a rocky area south west Iceland. It is where the local law making body (Althing parliament) meets. In older days, the parliament meets at Þingvellir. Þingvellir was very easily accessible from the towns of the south west Ireland. The area landscape is very beautiful. The exact location of the Lögberg is unknown. In 1000 years, the geography of the rift valley changes a lot. Two possible locations have been identified in Þingvellir. One of them is a flat ledge on top of a slope named Hallurinn (currently marked by a flagpole). The other area is in the Almannagjá fault against a rock wall. There is a proposal to make a place in the Hestagjá ravine the most idea location. The Lögberg was the place on which the Lawspeaker (lögsögumaður) took office as the chief official of Althing. Speeches and announcements were made from the spot. Anyone attending could make their speech from the Lögberg. The parliament also starts and ends their gathering at the location. The Lögberg serves as the location for the parliament since 930 A.D. It was no longer used after 1262 A.D. In 1962, Iceland was controlled by Norway. == References == Category:Geography of Iceland",
