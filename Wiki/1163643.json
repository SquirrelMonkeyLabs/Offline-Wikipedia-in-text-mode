 "text": "The spotted nurse frog (Allobates algorei) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela and Colombia. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in forests that have never been cut down. It lives near streams. It can sometimes live in places that people have changed. Scientists saw the frog between 400 and 1185 meters above sea level. The place where the frog lives has some protected parks in it, for example Páramos de Batallón y La Negra National Park, Chorro El Indio National Park, and El Tamá National Park in Venezuela and Tamá National Natural Park in Colombia. But when scientists went to Tamá National Natural Park to look for frogs and other animals, they did not see any A. algorei frogs there. ==Young== Male frogs sit on the dead leaves on the ground, under rocks, or in between plants and call to the female frogs. Scientists think that the female frog lays eggs on land and that, after the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Venezuela's Fauna Red List says that this frog is not in danger of dying out in the country. The IUCN Red List says that this frog is in a little danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives, mostly to make small farms and to move water from streams to the farms. The chemicals that farmers use can also hurt the frog. Scientists also found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on some of the frogs, but they did not see any frogs that were sick with the disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
