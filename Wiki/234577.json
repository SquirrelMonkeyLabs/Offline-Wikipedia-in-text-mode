 "text": "This is a list of people who have served as President of the United States. As of 2025, there have been 45 men sworn into office and 47 presidencies; there have been more presidencies than people sworn into office because Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump won two nonconsecutive (not back-to-back) terms. Donald Trump is the 47th and current president; he also served as the 45th president. George Washington, the first president, is the only president who was not a member of a political party. William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, at 31 days; Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest at over twelve years. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only president to serve more than two terms; he died early in his fourth. The youngest person to serve as president is Theodore Roosevelt, at 42 years old; the oldest is Joe Biden, at 82 years old. The youngest person elected President is John F. Kennedy at 43 years old; the oldest is Donald Trump at 78 years old. John F. Kennedy had the shortest lifespan of any president, at 46 years; Jimmy Carter had the longest, at 100 years. Eight presidents have died in office (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, Warren G. Harding, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy). Richard Nixon is the only president to resign from office. Five people (John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump) won the presidency without winning the most votes in their election. Three presidents have been impeached (Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump); Donald Trump is the only president to be impeached twice. Barack Obama was the first president of color. ==List of presidents== Presidency Presidency Portrait President Party Party Election Vice President 1 – George Washington Unaffiliated 1788–89 John Adams 1 – George Washington Unaffiliated 1792 John Adams 2 – John Adams Federalist 1796 Thomas Jefferson 3 – Thomas Jefferson Democratic- Republican 1800 Aaron Burr 3 – Thomas Jefferson Democratic- Republican 1804 George Clinton 4 – James Madison Democratic- Republican 1808 George Clinton 4 – James Madison Democratic- Republican 1808 4 – James Madison Democratic- Republican 1812 Elbridge Gerry 4 – James Madison Democratic- Republican 1812 5 – James Monroe Democratic- Republican 1816 Daniel D.
