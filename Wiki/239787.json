This was their first album released on Epitaph Records (a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz). Released during the breakthrough year for alternative rock and grunge, The Offspring achieved small success with Ignition in Southern California and gathered a small following. This success would grow with their next album Smash. \"Kick Him When He's Down\" was released as a promotional single in 1995 after the band had risen in popularity; it is one of the few singles that did not appear on the Greatest Hits album. ==Track listing== # \"Session\" (Kristine Luna, Jill Eckhaus, The Offspring) – 2:32 # \"We Are One\" – 4:00 # \"Kick Him When He's Down\" – 3:16 # \"Take It Like a Man\" – 2:55 # \"Get It Right\" – 3:06 # \"Dirty Magic\" – 3:49 # \"Hypodermic\" – 3:22 # \"Burn It Up\" – 2:43 # \"No Hero\" – 3:22 # \"L.A.P.D.\" – 2:46 # \"Nothing from Something\" (Marvin Fergusen, The Offspring) – 3:00 # \"Forever and a Day\" – 2:37 ==Personnel== ===The Offspring=== * Dexter Holland - Vocals * Noodles - Guitar * Greg K. - Bass * Ron Welty - Drums ===Other=== * Recorded and mixed by Thom Wilson at Westbeach Recorders, Hollywood, USA * Recorded and mixed by Ken Paulakovich at Track Record, North Hollywood, USA * Produced by Thom Wilson * Assistant engineered by Donnell Cameron and Joe Peccerillo * Mastered by Eddie Schreyer == References == Category:1992 albums Category:The Offspring albums Category:Punk albums",
