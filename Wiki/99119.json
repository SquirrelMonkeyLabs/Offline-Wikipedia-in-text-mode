 "text": "The Italian campaign was a series of battles fought between Austria-Hungary and Italy in the mountains of northern Italy between 1915 and 1918. Italy did not fight for the Triple Alliance, despite promises to Germany and Austria- Hungary, in 1914, when World War I started. In 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente to take part of Austria-Hungary. Italian irredentism wanted the province of Trento (Trentino), the port of Trieste and the province of Bolzano-Bozen (Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol), Istria, and Dalmatia. Italy had hoped to begin the war with a surprise attack to act quickly and capture several Austrian-held cities. However, the war in Italy soon turned to trench warfare, which was similar to that of the Western Front. ==References== Category:Battles of World War I Category:1910s in Italy Category:1910s in Austria Category:20th century in Hungary Category:1915 in Europe Category:1916 in Europe Category:1917 in Europe Category:1918 in Europe",
