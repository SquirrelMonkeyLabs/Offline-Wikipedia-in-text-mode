 "text": "The Tree That Owns Itself is a white oak tree in Athens, Georgia that is said to own itself and the land within eight feet of it. Legend says that a man named William Henry Jackson deeded the tree the ownership of itself and its surrounding land in the early 19th century. The original tree fell in 1942, but a new one was grown from one of its acorns and planted in the same location. Although the deed is lost or never existed, the local government recognizes the tree as owning itself, and it is maintained as a public street tree. The story of the tree is well-known, but there is no legal basis for the ownership claim. == References == Category:Trees Category:Georgia (U.S. state)",
