 "text": "The Third Punic War (149 BC to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. It was fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage, and the Roman Republic. The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars, and was mostly just the Romans attacking the city of Carthage in the Battle of Carthage. The Romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city and tore down the buildings. They did this because they hated the Carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them, and didn't want to fight another, so they totally destroyed them. == Other websites == * Delenda est Carthago Category:Punic Wars Category:2nd century BC Category:Wars and battles of Ancient Rome",
