 "text": "Henry George was an American economist who lived during the 19th century. He was born in Philadelphia in 1839 and died in New York City in 1897. George is best known for his book \"Progress and Poverty\", which had a big impact on economic thought and politics in America and around the world. In \"Progress and Poverty\", George argued that land should be owned by the community as a whole, rather than by individuals. He believed that if land were treated as a common resource, rather than a commodity to be bought and sold, it would benefit everyone, not just the wealthy. George's ideas became known as Georgism, and they continue to be influential in modern discussions about economics and social justice. Georgism proposes a tax on the unimproved value of land, which would replace other forms of taxation and create a more equitable society. Aside from his economic work, George was also involved in politics. He ran for mayor of New York City in 1886 on the United Labor Party ticket, and received over 30% of the vote. His campaign focused on issues of economic inequality and corruption in government. George's ideas and legacy continue to be debated and studied to this day. His work has influenced figures as diverse as Winston Churchill, Sun Yat-sen, and Martin Luther King Jr. Category:American economists Category:1839 births Category:1897 deaths",
