 "text": "Chiromantis is a group of frogs. These frogs are in the scientific family Rhacophoridae. In English, these frogs are named foam-nest frogs or foam-nest tree frogs. These frogs live in Sub-Saharan African places that are near the middle of the planet Earth, where it is warmest. Following the molecular genetic study by Chen and colleagues (2020), the Asian species formerly assigned to Chiromantis have now been reclassified to the resurrected genus Chirixalus. ==Description== Chiromantis lay their eggs in piles of foam on the ground. ==Species== These species are in Chiromantis: * Chiromantis kelleri Boettger, 1893 * Chiromantis petersii Boulenger, 1882 * Chiromantis rufescens (GÃ¼nther, 1869) * Chiromantis xerampelina Peters, 1854 ==References== ==Other websites== * *Chiromantis at CalPhotos Category:Frogs of Africa",
