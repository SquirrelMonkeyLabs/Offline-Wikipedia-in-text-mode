 "text": "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the United States Government agency which is primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid. ==Background== President John F. Kennedy created USAID from its predecessor agencies in 1961 by executive order. USAID's programs are authorized by Congress in the Foreign Assistance Act, which Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation. Although it is technically an independent agency, USAID operates subject to the foreign policy guidance of the President, Secretary of State, and the National Security Council. USAID operates in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. In February 2025, Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency, announced the intention of shutting down USAID. After the shut down was announced, the USAID website and its public document library, called the Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC), was also taken offline. Some of these documents have been saved and are now available on an independent website Independent DEC Archive (usaid.onl) == List of Administrators == No. Administrator Tenure President(s) served under 1 Fowler Hamilton 1961–1962 John F.
