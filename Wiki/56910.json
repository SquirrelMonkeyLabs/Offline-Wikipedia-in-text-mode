 "text": "The International Baccalaureate, or IB, is a well-known advanced school program. It is taught in English, French and Spanish in more than 140 countries. Students earn an IB Diploma after passing exams and completing the program requirements. They have to take classes in 6 subject areas. This is more than most countries. The six subject areas are: Language 1 (first language), Language 2 (second language), Math, Science, World Studies, and Electives. History, Literature, Geography, and Economics are all World Studies subjects. Students also have the option of taking a second science class instead of an elective. Students have to write a 4000-word paper called an Extended Essay, take a philosophy class called Theory of Knowledge, and complete 150 hours of CAS (Creativity, Action, Service). Students have to do to 3 subjects at Higher Level (HL) and 3 subjects at Standard Level (SL). HL classes are longer and more complex, although SL classes are still somewhat more challenging than regular program classes. IB is studied in most countries, but some schools study the IB differently. ==Similar articles== *Advanced Placement Program, a competitor to the IB Program ==Other websites== *International Baccalaureate official website *List of IB World Schools by country Category:Examinations",
