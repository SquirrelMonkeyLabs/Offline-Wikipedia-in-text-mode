 "text": "Ice storms are weather phenomena caused by freezing rain. The falling rain comes into contact with surfaces and turns into a thin sheet of ice. Ice storms cause accidents, take power lines down and cause serious damage. == Formation == It starts with a layer of warmer (not freezing) air above a layer of huge-freezing temperatures lower down. Frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer, and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below. #If the precipitate refreezes while still in the air, it will land on the ground as sleet. #Or, the liquid droplets continue to fall without freezing. They pass through the cold air just above the surface. This thin layer of air cools the rain to a temperature below freezing (), but the drops themselves do not freeze. This is a phenomenon called supercooling. When the supercooled drops strike ground or anything else below (e.g. power lines, tree branches, aircraft), a layer of ice builds up, hence \"freezing rain\". == Reeferences == Category:Severe weather Category:Ice",
