 "text": "The alveolar approximant is a consonant. It is used in some languages. It is used in English where the letter \"r\" is used for the sound, as in run or brick. The International Phonetic Alphabet represents the alveolar and postalveolar approximants as ⟨⟩. International Phonetic Alphabet represents it as a lowercase letter r rotated 180 degrees, or in broad transcription ⟨⟩; the X-SAMPA symbol of this is ⟨`r\\`⟩. Many times the symbol is written as ⟨⟩ instead of ⟨⟩ because typing ⟨⟩ is easier. == Features == == Examples == Language Word IPA Meaning Armenian Eastern 'coffee' Chukchi ңирэк 'two' Dutch Goois 'through' Leiden dialect 'rat' English American dialects citing , , and 'red' Australian Received Pronunciation Faroese 'rudder' German WesterwaldWäller Platt: Die Aussprache 'vine shoot' Siegerland, cited in Universität zu Köln: Phonologische Analyse Upper Lusatian Portuguese Many Central-Southern Brazilian dialects 'green' Some countryside Central-Southern Brazilian dialects 'rainstorm' Spanish Some dialects citing and doscientos 'two hundred' Vietnamese 'to clean' Zapotec Tilquiapan rdɨ 'pass' ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * Category:Consonants",
