 "text": "Liquid nitrogen is nitrogen at a very low temperature. It is usually produced by a process known as fractional distillation of air. At atmospheric pressure (normal pressure) nitrogen boils at −196 °C (77 K; −321 °F). Nitrogen was first made into a liquid at Jagiellonian University on 15 April 1883. Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski were the first scientists to liquefy nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide.Cryosurgery: A Practical Manual, ed. Paola Pasquali (Berlin; Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2015), p. 7 During World War II the production of liquid nitrogen became common.Ebbe Almqvist, History of Industrial Gases (New York; London: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2003), p. 423 This lowered the cost to produce it. After the war new uses were found for liquid gases. Liquid nitrogen became a major gas in the US. ==Uses== Liquid nitrogen has a variety of uses, as it is easy to transport, and compact. * Removal of warts *In Cryosurgery * Storage and preservation of cells * Shrink welding * In food preparation, for foods such as ice cream *To cool electronics, such as infrared sensors * In Cryogenics == References == Category:Nitrogen",
