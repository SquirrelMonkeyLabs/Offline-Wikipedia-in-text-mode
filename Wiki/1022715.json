 "text": "A coffee table book is a large, usually hard-covered book for display on a table. It is often non-fiction with pages of photographs and illustrations, captions, and small blocks of text. The idea of a book intended for display more than reading was mentioned by Michel de Montaigne in his 1581 essay and Laurence Sterne in his 1759 novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. In the late 1940s, publisher Albert Skira and a few others began producing large folio and quarto format art books, illustrated with tipped-in color plates. David Brower is sometimes credited with inventing the modern coffee table book.Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith (2015) A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art (3 ed.).
