 "text": "The WAGR Q class were a total of 2 utility steam locomotives operated originally by the Public Works Department (PWD) from 1928, and later by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1931 to 1953. The Q class were built in 1928 for the PWD by Andrew Barclay & Son of Kilmarnock, Scotland essentially being an upgraded version of the G class then in use, with a utilitarian appearance and design for ease of maintenance and operation. In 1931 the railway construction branch of the PWD was amalgamated with the WAGR, where both engines lost their names (Wiluna and Nornalup) and gained the running numbers 62 and 63. Both continued working on building projects until the late 1930s when they were reassigned as shunters. No. 62 was withdrawn in 1949, and No. 63 in 1953, both being scrapped.
