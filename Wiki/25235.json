 "text": "Fighter aircraft are small military planes that are made to fight other airplanes. They are often fast, having aerodynamic shapes (shapes that make them move through air easily) and very powerful engines for their size. Fighters may carry many different kinds of weapons, including missiles, machine guns, and bombs. Fighters may be used as attack aircraft to attack vehicles, soldiers, or buildings on the ground. They are different from bombers because they are mainly designed to fight other airplanes. Specialized fighters have been made, such as night fighters, interceptors, and air superiority fighters. Fighter aircraft also usually are maneuverable (turn well). == Recent developments == * To counter the speed of modern aircraft, some surface ships are being designed with laser weapons. * In the Russian invasion of Ukraine ground-to-air missiles are used against fighter planes. == Examples of fighter aircraft == * Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor * MiG-17 * North American P-51 Mustang * SPAD S.XIII * Su-27 * Mitsubishi A6M \"Zero\" * Lockheed P-38 Lightning * Shenyang J-35 == Other websites == https://techvozone.com/best-fighter-jets-in-the-world/ * WW2DB: List of WW2-era Fighter Aircraft * aircraft fighter: aircraft fighter in the world Category:Military aviation Category:Air force",
