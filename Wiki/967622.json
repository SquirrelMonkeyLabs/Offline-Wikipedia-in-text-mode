 "text": "The Second French War of Religion was an armed conflict in France fought between the Catholic royal government and the Huguenots. The war began on September 25, 1567 and ended on March 23, 1568. The leader of the Huguenots, Prince Louis of Condé, feared that the young king, Charles IX, wanted to persecute the Huguenots. To prevent this, Condé and about 1,500 of his supporters attempted, on September 25, 1567, to kidnap the King at Meaux. This incident, known as the \"Surprise of Meaux\", led directly to the start of the Second War of Religion. The King escaped Condé's trap and fled into the city of Paris. == Campaign around Paris and the Battle of Saint-Denis == Condé began to rally his Huguenot army outside of Paris, and started to destroy the countryside. The Catholics, led by the Constable Anne de Montmorency, rallied an army as well and left the city to face the Huguenots in battle. On November 10, 1567, Montmorency and Condé fought a battle at Saint Denis, just outside Paris. There was no clear winner, but Condé had so few soldiers that he decided to retreat. Montmorency was wounded during the fighting, and died of his wounds two days after the battle. == The War in the Provinces == Elsewhere in France, the Huguenot succeeded in capturing some, but not all, of the places they had taken in the First War. In much of the country, the Catholic population and government was more prepared than they had been in 1562 and prevented Huguenot take-overs. Huguenot forces from across France, from the start of the war, tried to march north and join Condé's main army. One of these groups, led by François de Boucé, seigneur de Poncenat, managed to defeat a Catholic army at the Battle of Cognat (January 6, 1568) and make its way up to the main army. ==References== Category:16th century in France",
