 "text": "A Cenotaph is an empty tomb or a monument built in honor of a person or group of people whose remains are elsewhere. It can also be the first tomb for a person who has since been reburied elsewhere. Although most cenotaphs honor individuals, many noted cenotaphs honor groups of individuals, such as the lost soldiers of a country or of an empire. Category:Burial monuments and structures",
