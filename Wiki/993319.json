 "text": "An electronic health record is a way of keeping the record of a person's health problems and treatments in electronic form. The information can be shared by health workers in different places. It can let people see their own health records and add to them. They also let scientists study many records so they can see patterns. They are also used to make bills. Getting these records shared over large areas and between different organisations takes a long time and costs a lot of money. When it is done, it can save a lot of time and money. Deadlines to set up shared electronic records in various parts of the English National Health Service have been missed several times. The latest plan was to \"raise every NHS trust to a “core” level of digitisation by March 2025\". When NHS Digital was closed in 2023, the money was mostly used for other things. == Electronic health record vs. electronic medical record == An electronic health record is a more comprehensive version of electronic medical record.
