He is a dual citizen of Australia and Latvia. On 29 December 2013, he and other Al Jazeera journalists were arrested in Cairo, Egypt by authorities on terrorism charges relating to the Muslim Brotherhood. On 23 June 2014, Greste was found guilty by the court, and sentenced to seven years jail. United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Australian officials were quick to show support for the jailed journalists. On 2 February 2015, Greste was released from prison and made to leave Egypt. This was ordered by the President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, because of a new law which lets the government deport foreign prisoners. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1965 births Category:Latvian writers Category:Australian criminals Category:Australian journalists Category:Australian prisoners Category:BBC people Category:Living people Category:Peabody Award winners Category:Writers from Sydney",
