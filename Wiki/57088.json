The Only Exception was in the years from 1946 to 1952, where in the Serie A there were 20-21 teams. All the 20 teams play two times against all the other teams from August to May. The top four teams in the Serie A qualify for the UEFA Champions League (from the 2017–18 season). The 5th and the winner of Coppa Italia qualify for the UEFA Europa League tournament. The 6th or the 7th ranked club, depending if the winner of Coppa Italia is qualified yet, joins the preliminary round of the UEFA Europa Conference League.
