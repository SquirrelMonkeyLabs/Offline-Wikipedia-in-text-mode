 "text": "The following is a list of programs that have been broadcast by the TeenNick cable channel. It was launched as a merge of two former teen-oriented programming blocks: TEENick on Nickelodeon and The N on Noggin. The channel still airs reruns of shows that originated on the TEENick block (such as iCarly), but as of the mid-2010s, all original productions from the Noggin block have been dropped. TeenNick's lineup primarily features reruns of programming that had aired on the main Nickelodeon channel. ==Current programming== ===Programming from Nickelodeon=== ====Live-action==== Title Premiere date Source(s) iCarly December 31, 2007 Victorious April 12, 2010 The Thundermans October 31, 2013 Sam & Cat March 12, 2014 Henry Danger September 18, 2014 Game Shakers September 12, 2015 Danger Force March 30, 2020 The Thundermans Undercover January 22, 2025 ====Animated (\"Nicktoons\")==== Title Premiere date Source(s) The Loud House November 24, 2017 Max & the Midknights October 30, 2024 ====News and sports==== Title Premiere date Source(s) Nick News October 25, 2010 NFL Slimetime September 15, 2021 ==Former programming== ===TeenNick=== ====Original programming==== =====Reality===== Title Premiere date Finale date Note(s) The N's Student Body Queen Bees The Nightlife Nick Cannon Presents: Fresh Artist =====Drama===== Title Premiere date Finale date Note(s) Hollywood Heights =====Comedy===== Title Premiere date Finale date Note(s) Gigantic Alien Dawn Burned off from Nicktoons =====Music===== Title Premiere date Finale date Note(s) TeenNick's Obsess This TeenNick Top 10 ====Programming from The N (block)==== Title Premiere date Finale date Note(s) South of Nowhere January 1, 2008 December 12, 2008 Beyond the Break January 1, 2008 June 25, 2009 O'Grady July 14, 2013 July 21, 2013 ====Programming from Nickelodeon==== An asterisk (*) indicates that the program had new episodes aired on TeenNick. =====Live-action===== ======Comedy====== Title Premiere date End date Source(s) Just Jordan December 31, 2007 December 26, 2008 The Naked Brothers Band December 31, 2007 May 25, 2009 Kenan & Kel December 31, 2007 May 31, 2014 Unfabulous December 31, 2007 January 12, 2016 Drake & Josh December 31, 2007 January 16, 2022 Zoey 101 December 31, 2007 July 31, 2023 Romeo!
