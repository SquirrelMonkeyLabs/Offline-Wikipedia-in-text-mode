 "text": "A fatberg is a build-up of non-biodegradable objects like wet wipes and liquids such as grease, oils, and fat. Fatbergs are found in sewer systems. They cause problems in the flow of sewage through the pipes and can cause blockages. It is very expensive to remove and sometime needs special equipment to remove. City officials warn people not to flush objects down the toilet so fatbergs do not form. ==References== Category:Waste management",
