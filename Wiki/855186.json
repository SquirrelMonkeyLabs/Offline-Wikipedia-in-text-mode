 "text": "Mahajirs/Mohajir/Muhajir () constitute about 8 percent of the population. They are Muslims who settled in Pakistan after the end of British India in 1947. Unlike other cultural ethnic groups of Pakistan, they do not have a tribe- based cultural identity. Urdu, the official language of Pakistan, is their native tongue, though many muhajirs speak other languages such as Gujarati, Memoni, Marwari etc as their mother tongue. Mohajirs were the vanguard of the Pakistan Movement, which advocated the partition of British India in order to create the independent nation of Pakistan for Indian Muslims. After the partition, a large number of Muslims migrated from various urban centers of India to live in the new nation of Pakistan. These migrants later identified themselves as mohajirs. A large number of Mohajirs settled in the cities of Sindh Province, particularly Karāchi and Hyderābād. Today they remain mostly urban. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan",
