 "text": "Nickel(II) oxide, also known as nickelous oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NiO. It contains nickel in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains oxide ions. ==Properties== Nickel(II) oxide is a light green solid. It does not dissolve in water. Sometimes it is gray because all of the nickel is not in the +2 oxidation state. It reacts with acids to make nickel(II) salts. For example, it reacts with hydrochloric acid to make nickel(II) chloride. It does not react with bases easily. ==Preparation== Nickel(II) oxide can be made by heating nickel powder in air at . This normally makes a black nickel oxide. It also can be made by reacting nickel with water at . The simplest way to make it is to heat nickel(II) hydroxide, nickel(II) carbonate, or nickel(II) nitrate. ==Uses== It is used to make alloys. It is also used in ceramics. It is used to make other nickel compounds. ==Safety== Nickel(II) oxide can irritate skin and make problems when breathed in. ==Related pages== *Nickel(II) sulfate Category:Nickel compounds Category:Oxides",
