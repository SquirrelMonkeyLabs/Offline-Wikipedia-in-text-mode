 "text": "Daryl Easton (August 13, 1955 â€“ February 24, 2017) known professionally as Daryl and born Daryl Martinez, was an American magician. He was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. He would call himself \"The Magician's Magician.\" Daryl usually went by his forename only. He specialized in card tricks, close-up and parlor magic. Two of his most famous contributions to magic were the \"Hot Shot Cut\", a knuckle-busting sleight where the spectator's chosen card spins like a boomerang out of the deck, and the \"Ultimate Ambition\" trick which allows a card to be inserted fairly into the middle of a deck and yet appear back on top. Daryl accidentally hanged himself in the closet of his hotel room in Hollywood, California on February 24, 2017. He was 61. ==References== ==Other websites== *Daryl's official site *Interview with Daryl on the Magic Bunny website Category:1955 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American magicians Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:Entertainers from Nevada Category:People from Las Vegas",
