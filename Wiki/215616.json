His next work was on a TV show called Butternut Square which was on TV from 1964 to 1967. After \"Butternut Square\" ended Coombs started the \"Mr. Dressup\" TV show. It would become one of Canada's longest-running children's TV shows. As Mr. Dressup he would do art, sing songs, tell stories and play children's games. In each show Mr. Dressup would dress up in costumes that he would find in a box he called his \"Tickle Trunk\". Coombs became a Canadian citizen in 1994. His TV show did not stop until February 1996.
