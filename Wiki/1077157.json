The crisis began on 19 October 2023 after attacks by the Houthi movement. The Houthis are a Shia Islamist insurgent group who control parts of Yemen and are backed by Iran. These attacks target Southern Israel. The Houthis also target ships in the Red Sea that they claimed are linked to Israel or its allies (particularly the United States and United Kingdom). The Houthi movement's fighters, who are in opposition to Yemen's internationally recognized government, have maintained control over a significant portion of the country's territory along the Red Sea since 2014. Following the onset of the Israel–Hamas conflict, the group, which is allied with Hamas, commenced launching missiles and drones targeting Israel. Additionally, Houthi militants have attacked various merchant vessels from different nations in the Red Sea, particularly in the Bab-el-Mandeb, which serves as the southern maritime access point to Egypt's Suez Canal and is a critical chokepoint for the global economy. The group has asserted that their actions will continue until Israel halts its military operations against Hamas.Yemen’s Houthis ‘will not stop’ Red Sea attacks until Israel ends Gaza war Retrieved 19 December 2024Israel ready to act against Houthi rebels if international community fails to, national security adviser says Retrieved 19 December 2024 The Houthis says they consider any Israel-linked ship as a targetWhat is the Red Sea crisis, and what does it mean for global trade?
