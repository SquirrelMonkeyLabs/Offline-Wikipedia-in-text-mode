 "text": "Gentoo Linux is a version of the Linux operating system. It was created by Daniel Robbins. It is named after the Gentoo penguin. ==Development== Gentoo Linux uses a package management system called Portage. Portage is like the BSD ports collection. Gentoo package management is designed to be modular, portable, easy to maintain, and optimized for the user's computer. Packages are normally built from source code, continuing the tradition of the ports collection, although some large software packages can be used as precompiled binaries for various architectures because it is easier. Gentoo was designed for the x86 architecture, but also works on the x86, x86-64, IA-64, PA-RISC; PowerPC, PowerPC 970, SPARC64, MIPS, DEC Alpha, System Z/s390, PS3 Cell Processor and SuperH architectures. Official support for 32-bit Sparc hardware has been dropped. == Package == Gentoo's official software package repositoryArchLinux.org, \"Official repositories,\" excerpt, \"A software repository is a storage location from which software packages may be retrieved and installed on a computer\"; retrieved 2012-6-7. includes, for example, UNetbootin.Gentoo, Package unetbootin;retrieved 2012-6-7. ==Related pages== *List of Linux distributions ==References== == Other websites == * The official website of the Gentoo Project * gentoo-wiki.com - An unofficial yet heavily used wiki about Gentoo * Category:Linux distributions Category:X86-64 Linux distributions",
