The Devanagari variety is commonly called Hindi or Hindui. The Nastaliq variety is commonly called Urdu or Lashkari.Although Urdu in form of Zuban-I Urdu-yi Mu'lla was already in use during the reign of Emperor Shajahan and referred to as Lashkari Zaban, Muhammed Shah made it popular among his people, declaring it to be his Court Language.
