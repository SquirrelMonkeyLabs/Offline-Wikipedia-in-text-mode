 "text": "A climbing harness (or simply harness) is used by rock climbers. It is used to secure the climber to a piece of rope. It is one of the basic parts of the rock climbing equipment. == Types == There are different types of harnesses. * A sit string harness looks like a belt, which is connected to two loops. The belt is worn around the waist and the loops are worn at the legs the connection is worn in the front. This connection is called belay loop. In this connection usually the knots are tied. Also it's used to belay the climber, with a knot or a securing device, like the Grigri. This is the most common type of climbing harnesses. * A chest harness is worn around the shoulders. It's additionally worn with the sit string harness. It's used to climb with a backpack. * A full-body harness is a combination of both. The chest harness and the sit string harness are connected. It's mostly worn by little children instead of a sit string harness. Workers who need to be secured of falling also usually wear this kind of harness. == References == Category:Protective clothing Category:Rock climbing Category:Mountain climbing Category:Sports equipment",
