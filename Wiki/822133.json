 "text": "Novy Chas (, New Time in English) is a private newspaper from Belarus. It comes every week. It writes about society and politics in the Belarusian language. == History == The government has been making troubles for Novy Chas all the time. Shortly after its start, Novy Chas was stopped to be printed. The newspaper was warned by the government of Belarus at the end of 2007. In June 2010, the paper was also warned by the Ministry of Information. Then it was took away from stores run by the government. It has been writing about the 2020 Belarusian protests and 2020 Belarusian presidential election, so several journalists of Novy Chas have been tried and arrested for that. Since February 2021, the newspaper is taken away from stores run by the government again. On May 28, 2021, the Deputy Prosecutor General of Belarus Maksim Voronin made a warning to the editor-in-chief of Novy Chas. The official did not like three stories printed in the newspaper in February and April 2021. The warning was written in Russian and had some citations from these Belarusian stories. Their translation from the Belarusian language into the Russian language was wrong, though. On June 7, 2021, Belposhta (Belpost (), Belarusian postal service) said no to making an agreement on using its subscription services for the second half of 2021 to the office of Novy Chas. On August 10, 2021, it became known that there will be no newspaper in the print form after August 12. The private printing house \"Roll Print\" wrote a letter about it on July 27. The printing house ran into troubles in the process of printing, so it became not possible to stick to the agreement on printing, it said. Novy Chas tried to find a new printing house but did not make it. Novy Chas promised that its website and social network services would be kept going. On October 19â€“20, 2021, the Novy Chas office and the houses of its journalist were looked for. The people were interrogated. Computers and other things were taken away. The European Federation of Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, the Belarusian Association of Journalists said bad words on that. On October 28, 2021, the domain name of Novy Chas novychas.by was stopped working in Belarus and other countries of the world. As a result, its journalists had to make another website of Novy Chas. It is novychas.online. In January 2024, it became known that the website and Internet pages of Novy Chas were banned in Belarus. Earlier in 2023, the newspaper's Telegram channel, its Odnoklassniki group, Instagram page and TikTok account were banned as well. == Awards == * Knight International Journalism Award of John S. and James L.
