 "text": "Comparison, in grammar, is a property of adjectives and adverbs. Adjectives and adverbs take three degrees, such as kind, kinder, kindest. The first degree is positive: : Bill is kind. The second degree is comparative: : Bill is kinder than Joe. The third degree is superlative: : Bill is the kindest man I have ever known. Likewise, the use of more as in more quickly is comparative, and the use of most as in most quickly is superlative. Category:Grammar",
