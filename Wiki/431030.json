 "text": "Surge was a soft drink manufactured (made) by The Coca-Cola Company. The product was made mostly in the United States beginning in early 1997. The soda was marketed as a substitute to Mountain Dew. It was created because Coca-Cola wanted to take customers from Pepsi. The brand was very popular at first, but that didn't last. Surge stopped being made in 2003. Surge was re-released by Coca-Cola as an Amazon exclusive in packs of 12 16oz cans because of the success of the \"Surge Movement\" campaign on September 15, 2014. ==References== Category:Coca-Cola Category:Soft drinks",
