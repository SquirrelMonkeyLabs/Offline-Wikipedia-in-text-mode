 "text": "Bearded dragons are agamid lizards in the genus Pogona. The central bearded dragon is the common name for Pogona vitticeps, which lives in dry areas of Australia The name \"bearded dragon\" refers to the fringes around and under the head. The underside of the throat turns black if they are stressed or see a potential rival. == Description == Central bearded dragons can grow to about 2 feet long. Half of the length of a bearded dragon's body is its tail. Females are usually smaller than males. If a bearded dragon is scared, it will flatten its body against the ground, puff out its spiky throat, and open its jaws to make itself look larger. Bearded dragons sometimes open their mouths wide to allow hot air to warm them better when they are lying in the sun. They also open their mouths to help them cool down; the warm air and heat escapes through their mouths. This behavior is similar to panting. == Diet == Central bearded dragons eat small and large insects, such as grasshoppers and worms. They also eat leaves, fruit, vegetables and flowers. They get most of their water from the food they eat, but they also need to drink sometimes. One can also give them horn worms (tomato worms) once or twice every two months as a treat. == Other websites == *Bearded dragon advice page *Bearded Dragons as Pets *Bearded Dragons Important Charts & Lists Category:Reptiles of Australia Category:Iguania",
