 "text": "Burmeister's frog or the common walking leaf frog (Phyllomedusa burmeisteri) is a frog that lives in eastern Brazil. People have seen it as high as 1000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests on the Atlantic side of the country. People have seen it sitting on plants near water that does not flow. The female frog leaves her eggs in nests that she makes out of leaves. The leaves are on branches high over the water. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. Scientists think this frog can live in places that human beings have changed. Scientists think this frog is in some danger from human beings changing the places where they live to dig useful rocks out of the ground and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
