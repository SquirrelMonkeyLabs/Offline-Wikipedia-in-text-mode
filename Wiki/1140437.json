In the original book trilogy (2008–2010), President Snow is the dictator of the state of Panem until he is removed from power. In the prequel book, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2020), he is a smart and charismatic 18-year-old. He is given the role of mentoring a girl competing in the tenth Hunger Games—singer Lucy Gray Baird—and forms a relationship with her. In the first four movies, President Snow is played by Donald Sutherland. He asked to be involved in the series as he believed it would engage young viewers in the politics of revolution. Tom Blyth was cast as the younger Snow in the movie The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023). ==References== Category:Fictional dictators",
