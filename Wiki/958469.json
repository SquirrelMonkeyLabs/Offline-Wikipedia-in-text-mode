 "text": "The AGS-17 \"Plamya\" is a Soviet automatic grenade launcher that fires a 30x29mm VOG-17M grenade. It was designed in 1968 by Alexander Fedorovich Kornyakov and KB Tochmash. The AGS-17 also is produced in other nations such as Serbia, Ukraine, Vietnam, China, Bulgaria and Iraq. The AGS-17 was designed to operate from a tripod and support Infantry in either direct fire on indirect fire, it has been seen used as a Mortar in the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine by both sides. The Plamya has been used in multiple wars, it was first used in the Soviet-Afghan war. It has also been used in other wars such as South African Border war, which was the first time it was used outside Afghanistan. It has also been used in the Gulf War, El Salvador Civil War, Chechen wars, and others. ==Design== The AGS-17 has a removable barrel to reduce heat and barrel stress, while it also has a tripod that is able to go up to 75° Angle and down to a -5° Angle. It is able to fire up to 400 rounds a minute. It also has two sights, an iron sight and a mortar-styled sight, but it also has a rail to use a scope and a sight. The Plamya also has a Snail drum that can carry up to 29 rounds of 30x29mm. ===Ammunition=== Since the AGS fires a 30x29mm VOG-17M round, it also can use other rounds such as the newer VOG-30, which is a newer version of the VOG-17M. The Plamya can also support rounds such as the: IO-30, IO-30TP (For training), VOG-30D, and the VUS-30 which is a smoke grenade. But since 2013, the VOG-17M and VOG-30 have been phased out in favor of the newer VOG-30D. The Bulgarian Company Arcus has also made a grenade named the AR-ROG, which is based on the VOG-17 to be used as a hand grenade. ===Purpose=== The purpose of the AGS-17 is to provide indirect and direct support. It has been seen used as a mortar in Ukraine, it has been seen also creating deathzones that cut off the enemy from a certain area. The AGS-17's design allows it to be used as a mortar due to it being able to go up to 75 degrees up. It has also been used to fight against vehicles that have little to no armor. The AGS-17 can be attached to other vehicles for better performance. The design of the AGS-17 also allows it to also be used to target fortifications, they are capable of destroying sand bags, and other types of fortifications. ==History== ===Development=== In 1960, the United States Army made the Mk.19, an Automatic Grenade Launcher that was used in the Vietnam War. It fired the powerful 40mm HE Grenade. It was proven effective in the war. The Soviet Union needed something to one-up this new design, so they made the AGS-17 with the help of Alexander Fedorovich Kornyakov and OKB-16 in 1968, but production would actually started in 1971. The Red Army tested the weapon in 1969, then started using it in 1971. ===Combat History=== ====Soviet-Afghan War==== The Soviet-Afghan War started in December, 1979. But before the war started, the Afghan People's Republic was formed after the 1978 coup by Nur Mohammad Taraki, they started a series of radical reforms that modernized the nation. They supressed any opposition from local Afghan Muslims, they arrested and executed over 27,000 protesters. It would later cause rebellions to occur April 1979. The Afghan Government called for support against the rebellion. The 40th Army under Leonid Brezhnev arrived to Kabul in December 27, 1979. they caused a coup which they killed the president and made a new one under Babrak Karmal, Soviet Troops later occupied large parts of Afghanistan, which caused the Mujahideen to fight a guerilla war against the Soviet Army. The AGS-17 saw service in the Soviet-Afghan War, it was used by both sides as Mujahideen captured some. It was used on Vehicles and Helicopters, and BTR Series IFVs. With every Platoon having an AGS-17 Squad, it was proved effective. ====Chechen Wars==== When the Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26th, 1991; The Chechens were not officially independent, being a de-facto recognized state. In 1993, the Chechen Republic declared independence. On December 11th, 1994, the Russian Armed Forces launched an attack to capture Grozny. The Battle of Dolinskoye was the first ever battle that had multiple Russian Casualties, then the Battle of Khankala which the Russians won and closed into Grozny, the Chechen Insurgents set up defensive positions in Grozny and waited for the Russians. During both of the Chechen Wars, the AGS-17 saw action by both sides. Chechen Mobile Friring Groups used the AGS-17 as a mortar and also as a support weapon thanks to it's design, the Chechens also found it useful in the battle of Grozny, and others battles in the wars. The Chechens also used the AGS-17 on Toyota Hiluxs. But with the Russians, every battalion had an AGS-17 Platoon, the platoon consisted of an AGS-17 squad, an antitank squad, and also an RPO flamethrower squad. Every platoon also had one forward observer that allowed it to be used as a mortar. ====Syrian Civil War==== In 2011, the Bashaar Regime brutally cracked down on protests during the Arab Spring. The People responded by rebelling and firing back, while some members in the Syrian Arab Armed Forces defected and formed the Free Syrian Army and later on the Syrian National Army. The Free Syrian Army at first controlled most of the Nation, but later on the Free Syrian Army lost most their lands and later became more of an insurgent group. The Syrian Arab Armed Forces have been seen using the AGS-17. The Syrian Republican Guard has been seen using the AGS-17. ====Russo-Ukrainian War==== In 2014, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhank's People Republic declared independence, which caused the Donbas conflict, the Russian Armed Forces fought and supported the separatists. And later on, the Russian Armed Forces invaded Crimea and later on annexed it. In February 24th, 2022; The Russian Federation invaded the Republic of Ukraine from Belarus, Crimea, and the Donbas. The AGS-17 has been seen used as a mortar by both sides. The Ukraininans use the RGSh-30, a variant of the AGS-17. The AGS-30 and AGS-40 were also seen in the war. The AGS has been preferred by both sides due to its design and and it's purpose and how it executes it. ====Other Conflicts==== The first time the AGS-17 was ever used outside of Russia was in the South Africa Border war. The 32 Battalion, one of South Africa's most elite units used the AGS-17 in Angola. The South African Government bought some AGS-17s.
