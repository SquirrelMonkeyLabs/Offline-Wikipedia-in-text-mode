Suarez, the 43rd Mayor of Miami, announced his campaign for the 2024 United States presidential election in a campaign video on June 14, 2023. ==Background== In April 2021, Suarez was seen as a possible running-mate to potential 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley emerged. A report by The Hill in September 2021 showed that Suarez was interested in running for president. Suarez spoke on Fox News on June 11, 2023, talking about his visits to early primary states and that he will make an important speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on June 15. He filed to run for president with the Federal Election Commission on June 14. ==Campaign== On July 5, 2023, a super PAC supporting Suarez created a chatbot that uses his face and voice to answer questions about his campaign. The bot directs users to campaign videos based on the questions asked, and can even make fun of other presidential candidates such as Ron DeSantis. The program is an example of artificial intelligence. On August 8, Suarez announced that he had met the donor requirements to attend the first Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. However, the RNC has to verify this claim before he is officially added to the debate. He said in an interview with The Hill that if he does not qualify for the first debate, he may leave the race. The campaign ended on August 29, 2023 after Suarez failed to qualify for the first debate. On March 1, 2024, Suarez endorsed Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, citing Trumpâ€™s position on the border as the main reason. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/miami-mayor-former-white-house-hopeful- francis-suarez-endorses-donald-trump-president.amp ==References== Category:2024 United States presidential campaigns",
