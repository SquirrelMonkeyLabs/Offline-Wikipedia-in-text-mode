At school, Harry begins to hear voices in the walls. Mysterious writing appears on the walls saying \"the Chamber of Secrets has been opened\". The Chamber of Secrets is a mysterious part of the school built by Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. The school staff learn that Ron's younger sister, Ginny, has been taken into the Chamber. Harry finds a magic black diary written by a former student named Tom Riddle. Harry goes into the Chamber of Secrets and finds Ginny, who has been captured by the ghost of Tom Riddle, who is the younger version of Lord Voldemort. It turns out that the book Draco's father gave to Ginny was the diary of Tom Riddle and she was the one who accidentally opened the Chamber. Tom Riddle tries to kill Harry with a gigantic snake called the Basilisk. Harry kills the snake with a sword and destroys the diary, which causes the ghost of Tom Riddle to disappear.
