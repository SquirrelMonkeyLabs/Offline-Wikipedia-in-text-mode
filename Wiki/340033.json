 "text": "A respirator is a kind of mask that is used to protect someone from breathing in dusts, fumes, or gases that might hurt them. Respirators come in many types and sizes. They are used by the military and industrial workers. They are also used by doctors in hospitals. To keep people safe, respirators keep air going to the filter by sealing to the face. This is not like a surgical mask, which does not seal to the face. This then causes air to go by the filter. A filtering facepice respirator is a respirator that is not made of plastic or rubber. They last for a shorter time. Atmosphere-supplying respirators are respirators that use a gas cylinder to hold breathable air. They are often used by firefighters. A type of respirator is a N95. Another is called an SCBA. == Beards == For men, some beards may up the amount of air that goes by the filter or respirator. To keep the face seal, NIOSH has a beard guide. This guide can be seen in the picture. ==References== ==Related pages== *Fume hood *Gas mask *N95 Category:Protective clothing Category:Headgear",
