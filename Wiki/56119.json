 "text": "AC Milan is an Italian football club in Milan. They were started in 1899 by two Englishmen, Herbet Kilpin and Alfred Edwards after a heavy drinking session in the Fiaschetteria Toscana tavern in Milan. Herbet Kilpin became the first team coach and captain whilst Alfred Edwards became the first club president. Their first name was Milan Cricket and Football Club. They have won the Serie A football league 18 times and the Coppa Italia football cup five times. They have won more trophies than any Italian club except for Juventus. In the 2005/06 season, they were punished for setting up the results. They started the 2006/07 season with an eight-point deficit, but they managed to finish fourth and win the UEFA Champions League qualification games. Milan won the 2006/07 UEFA Champions League, defeating Liverpool 2–1 in the final in Athens. Milan play at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, also known as San Siro because Giuseppe Meazza was a star player for Inter Milan. ==Name== The club was founded by as Milan Football and Cricket Club by an Englishman named Herbert Kilpin. Because of its English origins, in both English and Italian, the club uses the English name \"Milan\" instead of the Italian name . A similar way of naming exists for Genoa CFC, which uses the name \"Genoa\" instead of because of its English origins. === Names === * 1899–1919 Milan Cricket and Football Club * 1919–1938 Milan Football Club * 1938–1945 Associazione Calcio Milano * 1945–present Associazione Calcio Milan == Honours == * Serie A : 19 ** 1901, 1906, 1907, 1950/51, 1954/55, 1956/57, 1958/59, 1961/62, 1967/68, 1978/79, 1987/88, 1991/92, 1992/93, 1993/94, 1995/96, 1998/99, 2003/04, 2010/2011, 2021 2022 * Serie B : 2 ** 1980–81, 1982–83 * Coppa Italia : 5 ** 1967, 1972, 1973, 1977, 2003 * Supercoppa Italiana : 7 – shared record ** 1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 2005, 2011, 2016 * European Cup / UEFA Champions League : 7 ** 1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007 * UEFA Cup Winners' Cup : 2 ** 1968, 1973 * UEFA Super Cup : 5 – shared record ** 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007 * Intercontinental Cup : 3 ** 1969, 1989, 1990 * Latin Cup : 2 ** 1951, 1956 * Mitropacup : 1 ** 1982 == League position == Season League Position 2000/01 Serie A 6th 2001/02 Serie A 4th 2002/03 Serie A 3rd 2003/04 Serie A Champions 2004/05 Serie A 2nd 2005/06 Serie A 3rd 2006/07 Serie A 4th 2007/08 Serie A 5th 2008/09 Serie A 3rd 2009/10 Serie A 3rd 2010/11 Serie A 1st 2011/12 Serie A 2nd 2012/13 Serie A 3rd 2013/14 Serie A 8th 2014/15 Serie A 10th 2015/16 Serie A 7th === Former position === == Players == ===First team squad=== ===Out on loan=== === Retired numbers === No. Player Nationality Position Milan debut Last match Ref 3* Paolo Maldini Italy Centre back / Left back 25 January 1985 31 May 2009 6 Franco Baresi Italy Sweeper 23 April 1978 1 June 1997 * Might be restored for one of his two sons, should either of them play professionally for the club. == Coaching staff == Position Name Manager Stefano Pioli Assistant manager Giacomo Murelli Technical coaches Daniele Bonera Davide Lucarelli Gianmarco Pioli Luciano Vulcano Fitness coaches Loca Monguzzi Matteo Osti Roberto Peressutti Marco Vago Goalkeeping coaches Luigi Turci Emiliano Betti Team manager Andrea Romeo == Presidents and managers == === Presidential history === Milan has had numerous presidents over the course of its history, some of whom have been owners of the club while others have been honorary presidents.
