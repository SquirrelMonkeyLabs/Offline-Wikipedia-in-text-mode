 "text": "The WWE Diva Search (also known as the RAW Diva Search) was a competition held by the professional wrestling company World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2003 to 2007 and again in 2013. The goal of the contest was to find a new female wrestler, called Diva by WWE at the time. From the 2004 contest onwards the winner of the contest was offered a WWE Contract which was worth $250,000. The competition took place on WWE's weekly television show Monday Night Raw. Despite only one winner of the competition each year (except 2003), WWE has signed multiple Diva Search contestants. Some competitors like Candice Michelle, Eve Torres, Maryse, The Bella Twins, Layla, Michelle McCool, and Alexa Bliss went on to win championships in the company. == Contests == Year Winner Runner Up Notes 2003 Jaime Koeppe Unknown Koeppe did not get a WWE contract like later winners 2004 Christy Hemme Carmella DeCesare 2005 Ashley Massaro Leyla Milani 2006 Layla El Jennifer England 2007 Eve Torres Brooke Gilbertsen 2013 Eva Marie JoJo Offerman Competition did not air === 2003 === In 2003 the first Diva Search was held, however, the winner, Jaime Koeppe did not get a contract.
