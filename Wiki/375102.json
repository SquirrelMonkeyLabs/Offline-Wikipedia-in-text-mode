 "text": "Clare Hall is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It was built in 1966. It has about 145 postgraduate students (students that already have a degree). It allows both men and women but no undergraduate students. It is one of the smallest colleges but has 125 Fellows (teachers), making the ratio fellows/students very high. The college was built by Clare College to make it easier for people who are not students anymore to come back to university and do further education. This is why the college has many facilities for families and for sports. == References == * == Other websites == *Official website Category:Colleges of the University of Cambridge Category:1966 establishments in England",
