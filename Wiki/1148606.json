 "text": "The New Great Migration refers to the demographic shift that has occurred from 1970 to the present, marking a reversal of the preceding 60-year trend of African American migration within the United States. Since 1970, various factors have contributed to the migration of African Americans to the Southern United States. These include the deindustrialization of cities in the Northeastern and Midwestern regions, the emergence of job opportunities in the \"New South\" characterized by lower living costs, a desire to reconnect with family, strong cultural ties, a perceived reduction in discrimination, and religious affiliations. ==References== Category:African-American history",
