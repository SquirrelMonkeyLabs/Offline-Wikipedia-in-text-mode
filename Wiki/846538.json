 "text": "Whitney is the second studio album by American singer Whitney Houston, released on June 2, 1987 by Arista Records as the follow-up to her self-titled debut album, Whitney Houston. The album features five top 10 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, which also became international hits. The album's first four singles—\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\", \"Didn't We Almost Have It All,\" \"So Emotional\" and \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\"—all hit number one on the US Hot 100, making her the first female singer to get four number one hits from one album. Along with three straight to number one singles from Houston's previous album, this gave the singer a seven consecutive number one hits, surpassing popular boy bands the Beatles and the Bee Gees, who each had six number one consecutive hits. == Critical reception== When the album was released, the critical reviews of Whitney were mixed. Some liked the material released from the album and compared it to her 1985 self-titled debut album, whereas some felt that Houston was not able to show her individuality as a singer. == Track listing == ==Personnel== \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\"1 *Narada Michael Walden – drums *Walter Afanasieff – synthesizers *Randy Jackson – bass synth *Corrado Rustici – guitar synth *Preston Glass – percussion programming *Marc Russo – alto sax *Gigi Gonaway – electronic drums *Sterling – synth horns *Jim Gilstrap -
