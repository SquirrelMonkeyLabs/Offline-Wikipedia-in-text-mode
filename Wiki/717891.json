The complaint raised concerns that Trump was asking for other countries to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. The controversy led to an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Because of the scandal, Trump was formally impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 18, 2019. However, the Senate voted to clear Trump of charges. ==References == Category:Presidency of Donald Trump Category:Political scandals in the United States Category:October 2019 events Category:September 2019 events Category:November 2019 events Category:Joe Biden Category:2020 United States presidential election Category:Politics of Ukraine",
