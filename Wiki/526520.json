 "text": "Chumar is a place in the provinces of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The area is claimed by both China and India. According to China's Ministry of Defence \"the two countriesâ€™ border, to this day, has not been designated\". The problem is that for centuries, the sparsely inhabited mountainous region existed as a buffer zone between empires. A border war broke out in 1962 that has to date killed thousands of soldiers. The tension between the two countries has come and gone but is now raised again. == References == Category:Territorial disputes of India Category:Jammu and Kashmir",
