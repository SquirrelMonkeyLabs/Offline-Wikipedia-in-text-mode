However, it did get #1 at the box office for three weeks straight and got nominated Best Animated Feature at the 2004 Oscars, but lost to The Incredibles. ==Future == In April 2011, DreamWorks Animation's CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie genre parodies like Shark Tale, Monsters vs. Aliens, and Megamind, saying that these moviess \"all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now.\" == References == Category:2004 computer-animated movies Category:2004 comedy movies Category:DreamWorks Pictures movies Category:American comedy movies Category:Movies about sharks Category:Movies composed by Hans Zimmer Category:Movies set underwater",
