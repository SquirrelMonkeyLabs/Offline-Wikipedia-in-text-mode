 "text": "Cycle sport is when people compete using bicycles. There are different types of bike races like road racing, mountain biking, and BMX. Some other non- racing bike sports are artistic cycling and cycle polo. The International Cycling Union (UCI) is in charge of organizing bike races around the world. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is in charge of human- powered vehicles, and they have fewer rules than the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association organizes long-distance bike races. Bike racing is in the Olympics. It's especially popular in Europe, where countries like Belgium, France, and Italy are big fans. Other countries like Australia and the United States are also fans of bike racing. == History == The first bicycle race happened on May 31, 1868, in Paris, France. It was a short race of 1,200 meters and was won by James Moore from England. He rode a wooden bicycle with solid rubber tires. You can see this bike now in a museum in Ely, England. The Union Cycliste Internationale was started on April 14, 1900, by Belgium, the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland. They wanted to replace the International Cycling Association because of a disagreement with Great Britain and other issues. Since the Olympic Movement started in 1896, cycling has been a part of every Summer Olympics. == References == Category:Cycling",
