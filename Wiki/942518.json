 "text": "ESPN Premium (previously known as Fox Sports Premium) is an Argentine premium subscription television channel. It broadcasts soccer from Argentina. ==History== On October 16, 2020, the Argentine Soccer Association broke the Argentine soccer television contract for the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, leaving Turner as the only company in the broadcast and leaving open the possibility that the Public Television broadcast matches at no additional cost. Finally, on October 30, the court ruled in favor of Disney, thus being able to broadcast the matches normally. Because Disney sold the rights to everything related to Fox Sports to Mediapro, including the so- called \"essential content\" (thus complying with one of the rulings imposed by the National Commission for the Defense of Competition) in April 2022, the company kept the Argentine soccer rights that previously belonged to Fox, and therefore also keeping the Fox Sports Premium signal. Due to this, and Disney no longer owning the rights to the \"Fox Sports\" brand, on May 1, 2022 Fox Sports Premium was renamed to ESPN Premium to reflect this change. Since 2017, it broadcasts half of the matches (7 of 14) of each date of the Argentine Professional Soccer League and the rest of the matches on a deferred basis, whether they are replays of the channel's matches, or the deferred broadcast of the rest of the 7 matches broadcast by TNT Sports, which are produced jointly by Torneos and the company La Corte. The channel has a similarity with the old organization of TyC Max, since you have to pay a monthly cost to watch the games. == Former logos == File:Fox Sports Premium (Argentina) - 2018 logo.png|2017-2019 File:Fox Sports Premium Argentina 2019.png|2019-2020 File:Fox Sports Premium Argentina 2020.png|2020-2022 File:ESPN Premium logo.svg|From 2022 Category:Television channels in Argentina Category:2017 establishments",
