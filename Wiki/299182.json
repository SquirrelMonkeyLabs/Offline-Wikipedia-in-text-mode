 "text": "The Portland Timbers are an American professional soccer club based in Portland, Oregon. In 1975, the team took the name \"Timbers\" because Oregon is known for logging and forestry. The team colors are green and gold (yellow). At every Timbers game in Portland, the Timbers Army are a large group of the loudest and proudest Timbers fans. Today, the team plays in Major League Soccer. The team played in the USL First Division before they joined Major League Soccer in 2011. The team's name may also be inspired by a club of the same name based in the same city that competed in the original NASL in the 70's and early 80's. ==References== Notes Category:1970s establishments in Oregon Category:1975 establishments in the United States Category:Major League Soccer teams Category:Portland, Oregon Category:Soccer in the United States",
