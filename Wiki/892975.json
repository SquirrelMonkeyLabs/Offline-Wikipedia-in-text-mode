 "text": "A stampede () is when a group of large animals suddenly start running in the same direction. This is because the animals are excited or scared. It may also mean when many people are trying to do the same thing at the same time. Non- human species that can cause stampedes include zebras, cattle, elephants, reindeer, sheep, pigs, goats, blue wildebeests, walruses, wild horses, and rhinoceroses. ==References== Category:Ethology Category:Mammals",
