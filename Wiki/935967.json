 "text": "The red-eyed snouted tree frog (Scinax ruberoculatus) is a frog. It lives in forests in Brazil, Suriname, and French Guiana. The red-eyed snouted tree frog is smaller than other frogs in Scinax. The adult male frog is 22.6–25.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 25.4–27.5 mm long. This frog is light gray or light brown in color, with a dark spot on its head. The scientists wrote that this spot looked like a human back tooth or like a moth to them. There is an off-white stripe on each side of the body. The upper half of the iris of the eye is red in color and the bottom half of the iris is gray in color. The belly is whitish. The tadpole is about 22.2 mm long, with the tail. The body is bronze in color with darker brown spots. Young frogs are gray with darker spots. The irises of their eyes are red all around with black color around the iris. The name ruberoculatus comes from the Latin words ruber for \"red\" and oculatus for \"having eyes.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
