 "text": "John Knox (c. 1510 â€“ 24 November 1572) brought the Protestant Reformation to Scotland and was one of the founders of the Presbyterian Church. Knox joined the movement to change the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland. He married twice and had five children. Knox preached until he died. A fight between Catholic France and Protestant England for Scotland began again because of the Reformation. Sometimes, France had more power. Other times, England had it. Knox spent many months as a galley slave. He also spent time in exile because of his Protestant beliefs. During a trip to Scotland, Knox's preaching helped the Protestant movement. Several Protestant noblemen came together and made a group called the Lords of the Congregation. When the group had more power, they invited Knox back to Scotland to stay. In 1500 and 1561, the Scottish Parliament accepted the Reformed confession of faith made by Knox and other people. Knox argued many times with Mary, Queen of Scots. In his book History of the Reformation in Scotland, he writes about his five \"conversations\" with the Roman Catholic queen. In one of those conversations, Mary asked Knox what right he had to rebuke the queen so directly and openly. Knox replied, \"I am a worm of this earth, and yet a subject...but I am a watchman, both over the realm (land) and the Kirk [Church] of God...For that reason I am bound in conscience (it is my duty) to blow the trumpet publicly (openly)\". Mary's violent life finally made even many of her Catholic supporters abandon her. She gave up the throne, which allowed Knox to pass the Refomation in Scotland and form the Presbyterian Church. ==References== Category:1510s births Category:1572 deaths Category:British Protestants Category:Calvinists Category:Christian theologians Category:Presbyterian ministers Category:Protestant Reformers Category:Scottish Christian clergy Category:People from East Lothian",
