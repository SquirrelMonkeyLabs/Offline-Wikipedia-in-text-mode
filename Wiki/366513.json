In March 2006, she made her debut as a television host at the Festival di Sanremo with Claudia Cedro, Francesca Lancini, and Marta Cecchetto. Hessler was the face of the DSL brand \"Alice\" in Germany (a service of Telefónica Europe) until late October 2011. The company chose to end her contract. This was done because of her personal relationship to and public support for the Gaddafi family. The company said that she had \"failed to distance herself from her comments on the conflict in Libya.\" == References == Category:American television actors Category:American models Category:Actors from Rome Category:1988 births Category:Living people",
