 "text": "The Caribbean nurse frog (Allobates caribe) is a frog. It lives in on the Penninsula de Paria Estado Sucre in Venezuela. ==Home== Scientists have seen this frog in exactly one place. It was 1050 meters above sea level. They saw female frogs in a stream bed with no water in it. Scientists think the frog might live in Pen√≠nsula de Paria National Park but they have not seen it there. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in streams and pools of water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Fires can burn the forests where it lives. People also cut down those forests to get wood to build with and to make places for visitors and to make farms, for example farms to grow cocoa, coffee, ocumo blanco, and ocumo chino. Scientists found the dangerous fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other amphibians near where the frog lives. B. dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, which has killed many frogs in South America. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
