During a Genius interview, Brian talked about how the song was created and when the verses were recorded, explaining: \"I followed X on Twitter, and I mentioned him on something. My manager was like, “Oh, you fuck with X?” And then, I’m like, “Yeah. Of course.” X is actually friends with Ronny J, and I was friends with Ronny J at the time. I still am. Ronny J just FaceTimed me. They were together, and X was like, “Oh, what’s up dude? I know you.” And I was like, “Oh shit. That’s cool.” X recorded his verse right there. Ronny J already had the beat. I picked it out, because it was super cool, and I liked it. X got on it, and then after a while, the whole shit happened where he went to jail and stuff. So, we sat on the track a little bit. Then Keith Ape was like, “Yo, can I get on that?” And I was like, “Of course.” Because, everybody was like, “You should collaborate with Keith ape! You guys are both fucking Asian and shit.” Alright, whatever. Let’s do it. So, I was down. And then, X got out of jail, and he’d already had his verse on the song. Then Keith recorded his verse. I actually recorded my verse last.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2017 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Hip hop songs",
