Now this project is the leading Wikipedia among other South East Asian language Wikipedias in quality. It has grown to be a wiki containing more than 31,000 articles . == History == The Malayalam language Wikipedia has been available in the wikipedia.org domain since 21 December 2002. A user Vinod Menon M. P. had taken the initial tasks for it. After its creation he was the key person for the next 2 years. Almost all the early users of Malayalam Wikipedia were Malayalees (speakers of the Malayalam language). The growth of the Wikipedia during these times was very slow due to technical issues such as browser problems, font problems, and other problems. == References == Category:Wikipedias",
