 "text": "Brito, real name Hércules de Brito Ruas, (born 9 August 1939 in Rio de Janeiro) is a former Brazilian footballer. He played as a central defender for many clubs, and for the Brazilian national team. Brito was regarded to be one of the best defenders in the history of Vasco da Gama. He was known as a classic defender as a great tackler, leader, man-marking opponent and a quick and tireless runner. ==Club career== He started his career at Vasco da Gama, his favorite team, in 1960, replacing Bellini, two-time world champion with the Brazilian national team. In 1971, in a classic between Botafogo and Vasco, the Vasco defender punched referee José Aldo Pereira, after a penalty was awarded against Botafogo. For the assault, he received a year's suspension. He stayed at the Rio club for 10 years. He was champion of the Rio-São Paulo Tournament in 1966 for the club. He arrived at Cruzeiro shortly after the 1970 FIFA World Cup, on loan from Flamengo, where he had a falling out with Yustrich. For Toca da Raposa, he played only 31 games until February 1971. In one of them, against Flamengo, after a 3-1 victory, in heavy rain, at Mineirão, the player ran towards the opponent's bench and threw his shirt at Yustrich, who tried to leave the tunnel in pursuit, but was held back by members of the coaching staff and reserve players. Raposa reached the semifinals of Robertão, the Brazilian at the time, and Brito entered the team for the first Silver Ball of the newly created Score Magazine. At the end of the loan, the athlete ended up transferring to Botafogo. He defended Corinthians in 1974 for 29 games (12 wins, 7 draws, 10 defeats), and scored 3 goals in favor and even scored an own goal. He also played for Internacional, Atlético Paranaense, Deportivo Galicia and River-PI. ==Intenational career== Brito made his debut for the Brazilian national team on May 30, 1964 during a friendly match against England. In total, he made 45 appearances for the Seleção, and played at two world cups. He was selected for the 1966 World Cup in England and played one match as a starter at the tournament, which was extremely disappointing because Brazil failed in the group stage. Brito was also selected for the 1970 World Cup, and he became a strongman in the Brazilians' defense at that tournament. Brito played all matches, including the final against Italy, and won the third world title for Brazil with the team. He was considered the best fit player at the 1970 World Cup by the WHO, Legend has it that during the preparation for this Cup, he broke a gym equipment while exercising. For Selecão, he made 45 between 1964 and 1972 and he scored once. ==International career statistics== |- |1964||3||0 |- |1965||0||0 |- |1966||6||0 |- |1967||0||0 |- |1968||10||0 |- |1969||2||1 |- |1970||13||0 |- |1971||7||0 |- |1972||4||0 |- !Total||45||1 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== * Rio de Janeiro State championship: 1956, 1963, 1964, 1965 * Torneig de Santiago de Xile: 1957 * Torneig de París: 1957 * Trofeu Teresa Herrera: 1957 * Torneig del Segle de Rio de Janeiro: 1965 * Rio-São Paulo: 1966 * Taça Guanabara: 1966 * Torneig d'Estiu (Verão): 1970 ===International=== Brazil * Copa Río Branco, 1967, 1968 * FIFA World Cup: 1970 * Roca Cup: 1971 * Brazil Independence Cup: 1972 ===Individual=== *Placars Bola de Prata (Silver Ball): 1970 ==References== ==Other websites== *Brito Caps Record *Honours of Brito Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Rio de Janeiro Category:1966 FIFA World Cup players Category:1970 FIFA World Cup players",
