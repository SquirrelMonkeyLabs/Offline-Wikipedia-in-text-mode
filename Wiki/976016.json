 "text": "Mario's Game Gallery (later re-released as Mario's FUNdamentals) is a video game published by Interplay Entertainment and developed by Presage Software Inc. for PCs running Microsoft Windows. The first version was released in 1995. In 1998, Mindscape re-released the game with a new title. Later, a version for Macintosh computers was published by Stepping Stone. Five traditional games are included: checkers, backgammon, Go Fish, dominoes, and Yahtzee, known in the game as \"Yacht\". Players play against Mario in these games, but sometimes they also play against Bowser. The games are very similar to the real-life versions, but pieces are changed to look like things from the Mario universe. Both versions of the game received a mixed reception. When it was first released, various publications found it to be a good educational game. The Miami Herald praised it for \"providing fun for the whole family\", and the Los Angeles Times said that it would appeal to younger gamers.
