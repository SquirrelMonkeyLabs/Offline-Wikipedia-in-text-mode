 "text": "The Torre Cecilia or Torione Cecilia is a mountain on Lake Como in the province of Lecco, Lombardy, northern Italy. It is part of the Gruppo delle Grigne; is located in the territory of Lierna above Lake Como. The peak reaches 1,800 metres in altitude. The particular shaped mountain, adjacent to the Torre del Cinquantenario, was designed by Leonardo da Vinci between 1505 and 1510, during his continuous stays on the shores of Lake Como mentioned in his Codex Atlanticus, the work is part of the Windsor Codex (on sheet 12406). Torrione Cecilia and Torre del Cinquantenario are the Dolomite group located in front of Rifugio Rosalba (1730 m.), and one of the most characteristic corners of Grignetta together with Alpe di Lierna. The mountain was at the center of enterprises in 1923 with Fanny Guzzi. There are many landscapes of Lake Como and its mountains drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, the object of his studies during his stays in Lierna. Leonardo da Vinci will study in the mountains above Lierna, from Porta di Prada to Rocca di Baiedo, from Fiumelatte to Bellagio, which \"unites the two opposites into one\", up to Monte San Martino, Resegone and the \"Giardino di Pietra\", not only the mountains but also the streams and caves beneath them, which radiate as he said like the veins of the human body. For Leonardo da Vinci, the mountains of Lake Como contain all the secret of the antiquity of the world, an essential part of the great cosmic cycle that binds rock, water, sky and the belly of the earth together. Leonardo da Vinci not only shows a theoretical interest in the mountains, but explores them in person, becoming a mountaineer in his own way. His travels to Lierna where he stayed to explore all the surrounding areas testify to the rocks, mountains, peaks, woods, landscapes that are present in many of his famous paintings. The most significant Alpine representation dates back to the second Milanese period: around 1511 Leonardo depicts a mountain group with precise outlines, in a small red chalk drawing. In the drawings of the Windsor code there is a view of medieval Lecco, as well as drawings of snowy crests that belong to the landscape of the eastern branch of Lake Como, there are also drawings of the central massif of the Grigne. == Drawing of Cecilia Tower == The drawing of Cecilia Tower is a work by Leonardo da Vinci, dating back to 1905 and preserved in the Codex Windsor, with Sheet 12406. The drawing was made during Leonardo's stay in Lierna. Cecilia Tower is depicted with detailed architectural features, highlighting Leonardo's interest in engineering and architecture. == Bibliography == * Leonardo da Vinci, Windsor Codex, F. 12406 == Related pages == * Il Dito (Lake Como) * Torre del Cinquantenario * Leonardo da Vinci * Lierna * Lake Como * Sentiero di Leonardo == Other websites == Como Category:Trails of Italy Category:Lecco",
