 "text": "The Uzi is a type of submachine gun (SMG). It is famous for being very small and easy to carry, much more easily than any SMG made in World War II. It does this by loading magazines inside the grip, much like a pistol. It was not the first submachine gun to do this, but the Uzi was the first used on a large scale. There are different kinds of Uzis: Mini Uzi, which is a smaller version of the Uzi; Micro Uzi, which is only slightly larger than a standard pistol; Para Micro Uzi, which was made for Counter Terrorist Units; and the Uzi Pistol, which is semi-automatic (it fires one bullet every time you pull the trigger). All of these kinds of Uzis are still in use by the special forces today. It is slowly being replaced by the MP-5. == History == Uzis were invented by an Israeli army officer, Uziel Gal. This gun was first used in 1956. Uzis were used in the 1967 Six Day War by Israel. They are made by Israel Military Industries and also by the Belgian weapon company, FN. Even though Uziel Gal told his manufacturers not to name the weapon after him, they ignored his request and did so anyway. ==References== ==Other websites== * Israel Weapon Industries (I.W.I.): Mini Uzi and Micro Uzi * The official Uzi website * Uzi history, parts, discussion forum * Uzi in parts (in German) * Uzi history and lore * Video of Uzi being fired (Japanese audio) * Video of suppressed Uzi being fired Category:Submachine guns Category:Military of Israel Category:Words and phrases in Modern Hebrew",
