 "text": "The South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust is the NHS trust for running ambulance services in south-eastern England. It covers Kent (including Medway), Surrey, West Sussex and East Sussex (including Brighton and Hove). It also covers a part of north-eastern Hampshire around Aldershot, Farnborough, Fleet and Yateley. It started in July 2006, with the merger of the ambulance services for Kent, Surrey and Sussex. It was put into special measures in September 2016 after the Care Quality Commission rated it inadequate because of bullying, delays and putting people at risk. == References == Category:NHS ambulance services trusts",
