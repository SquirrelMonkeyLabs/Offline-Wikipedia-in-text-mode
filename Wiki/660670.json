 "text": "Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorcorated is an American children's mystery TV show. This is the 11th series in the Scooby-Doo franchise. Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc. does some of the same things that older Scooby Doo shows did. For example, they would usually unmask the Monster and prove it was a hoax the same way that they did in the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! show. It’s different from older shows because it has all the episodes be part of one story, has the characters not always get along (and also sometimes dating each other) and because it’s the first time that Scooby Doo has to fight real monsters since \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\". Just like the past series Mystery Inc. changes what the characters look like, but this time they have an old look with only small changes, like Velma now wearing bows in her hair. == Plot == === Season 1 === Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are a team of mystery solvers living in a small town of Crystal Cove, which people say is haunted. The town has a long history of strange disappearances and Ghosts and Monsters. A lot of tourists go to Crystal Cove to see the Ghosts and Monsters. Because of this the adults of the town (especially Fred's father Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone) are not happy that the kids are proving the monsters are fake. The team also finds out that there is a dark secret that is hidden in the past of Crystal Cove. Following clues from a man who calls himself \"Mr. E.\" , the gang learns the legend of a cursed Conquistador treasure, the secret history of Crystal Cove's founding Darrow Family, and the mysterious, unsolved disappearance of four mystery-solving kids and their pet bird—the first Mystery Incorporated. Solving this mystery is hard because of romance. : Shaggy has a hard time dating Velma while still being best friends with Scooby, while Daphne is in love with Fred, who loves to trap things and doesn’t realize that he’s in love with Daphne. === Season 2 === The return of the original Mystery Incorporated to Crystal Cove begins a race between the two groups to find the pieces of a disk, which will point the way to the cursed treasure under the town. It turns out that these two groups are not the only teams of mystery-solvers that have lived in Crystal Cove: many other groups, always made up of four humans and an animal, have existed. And it turns out that the kids have to stop the End of the World. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo, and Fred * Mindy Cohn as Velma * Grey DeLisle- Griffin as Daphne * Matthew Lillard as Shaggy ===Recurring=== * Lewis Black as Mr. E (Ricky Owens), who was in the original Mystery Inc. * Linda Cardellini as Hot Dog Water (Marcie Fleach), who used to be a friend of Velma.
