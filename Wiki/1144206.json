 "text": "The fanon is a special piece of clothing used in the Catholic Church during important religious ceremonies. It is mostly worn by the Pope but can also be worn by the Patriarch of Lisbon. == Description == The fanon is made of two round pieces of cloth, usually silk, with stripes of gold and white. It is worn over the chasuble and looks like a short cape or wide collar. One part of the fanon goes in the front, and the other part goes on the back. There is a small hole for the stole to pass through, which is worn under the fanon. == History == The fanon has been used by the popes for many centuries, starting in the early Middle Ages. It was worn during special Masses (e.g. pontifical Mass) as a symbol of the pope's authority. The fanon showed the special role of the pope as the leader of the Catholic Church. Over time, the fanon became less common. However, some popes, like Pope Benedict XVI, brought it back during certain religious services. == Related pages == * Pallium * Chasuble == References == Category:Liturgical clothing Category:Christian symbols Category:Christian clothing",
