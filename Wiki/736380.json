 "text": "The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (The WCPAEB) was an American psychedelic rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965 and active until 1970. The original lineup included Bob Markley, Michael Lloyd, John Ware, and brothers Shaun and Danny Harris. The group recorded five studio albums, including one under the name, Markley, A Group. Their style has been described as one of the “ more offbeat acts to emerge during the psychedelic era”. In Los Angeles, during the group’s early years, they were known for their elaborate psychedelic light shows which accompanied their live performances. The WCPAEB first recorded on the small FiFo record label the album Volume One in 1966. They recorded three albums on the larger Reprise label between 1967 and 1968. A Child’s Guide to Good and Evil is generally considered their best work, but the band’s commercial success was limited. After 1967, the WCPAEB was strictly a studio band. Two albums, Where’s My Daddy? and Markley, A Group, were released on independent record labels before the group broke up in 1970. == References == Category:American rock bands Category:1965 establishments in California Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1970",
