 "text": "The New York State Executive Mansion is the official residence of the governor of New York and the state's first family. It is a historic U.S. residence. It is at 138 Eagle Street in Albany, New York. It has been the residence of every governor of the state since 1875. == History == The building was built in 1856 as a private home in the Italianate style for banker Thomas Olcott. During the 1860s, the residence was remodeled many times by the second owner Robert L. Johnson. Samuel Tilden became the first governor to live in the house when he rented it in 1875. The state purchased it two years later. After a fire in 1961, Governor Nelson Rockefeller fought for restoration. He was instrumental in getting the mansion named to the National Register of Historic Places. In the early 1980s, the Executive Mansion Preservation Society was established to coordinate restoration of the home. Inmates from state prisons once staffed the mansion. Many governors over the years have changed the mansion. Theodore Roosevelt had a gymnasium constructed during his stay. Franklin D. Roosevelt installed a swimming pool in 1932. Mario Cuomo had the pool restored during his term in office. Al Smith had a zoo built. Nelson Rockefeller added the mansion's tennis courts. Twenty-nine governors had used the building on a mostly full-time basis until Governor George Pataki. == Tours == Free guided tours of the Executive Mansion are given on Thursdays from September to June at 12:00, 1:00, and 2:00 p.m. by reservation only. Tours for school groups are also offered. == References == Category:Albany, New York Category:Buildings and structures in New York (state) Category:Governors' mansions in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places",
