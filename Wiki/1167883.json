It is located northwest of Manila. It is accessible by way of the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX). The airport (previously known as Diosdado Macapagal International Airport, 2003-2014) serves Metro Clark, as well as the entire Central Luzon, Northern Luzon and, to an extent, the Manila metropolitan area and capital city with international and domestic flights. The name is derived from the former U.S. Clark Air Base, which was the largest overseas base of the United States Air Force until it was closed and handed over to the Republic of the Philippines in 1991. ==References== Category:Airports in the Philippines",
