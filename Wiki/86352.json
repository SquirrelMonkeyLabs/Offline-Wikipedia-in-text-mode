 "text": "Intel Core is the name of a family of 32-bit dual-core microprocessors. It was made by the technology company Intel. Intel Core processors are based on Pentium M technology. Those processors are more advanced than Intel P6 processors. This architecture, or way to build a processor, is now replaced by Core 2 microarchitecture. In the Core family, there are two groups: the Duo (with two cores) and Solo (Duo with one disabled core). The Solo line replaced the Pentium M one-core processor. In September of 2006 and January of 2008, Core CPUs stopped selling as much, as Intel released CPUs with newer technology. ==Yonah== Yonah is a company name for Intel's first generation of microprocessors for mobile computers. The Core Duo was released on 5 January 2006. It was the first Intel processor to be used in Apple Inc.'s Macintosh computers. Yonah does not have 64-bit function. The Intel Core Duo has two cores, 2 Mebibytes of L2 cache for both cores, and an arbiter bus that controls the L2 cache and front side bus access. The Intel Core Solo uses two- cores die as a Core Duo, but one core is turned off. ===Technical specifications=== * 151 million transistors, with 2 MiB L2 cache. * 2.33 – 2.50 GHz * front side bus (FSB) is 667 MT/s (per second) * supported by the 945GM, 945PM, 945GT, 965GM, 965PM, and 965GT chipsets ===Advantages and shortcomings=== The duo version of Intel Core (Yonah) has two cores, which give performance per watt almost as good as single-core processors. In computer machines operating with batteries, this means getting as much total work done in one battery charge like in old computers. The shortcomings of Intel Core (Yonah) are: * 64-bit is not supported. * Limited FPU (Floating Point Unit) throughput (amount of data computed in a certain time) for non- parallel (not at the same time) computations or single processes. * \"Performance per watt\" is not better or even worse than older processors. Core-based processor Intel Xeon Sossaman LV (low-voltage), for servers also does not have the Intel 64-bit function. All new server systems have support for x86-64, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 even requires a 64-bit processor to run. On July 27, 2006, Intel released newer Core version Intel Core 2. == Related pages == * Intel * FSB * Multi-core processor ==References== ==Other websites== *Intel Core Duo Web page *Intel Core Solo Web page *Processor comparison table *Intel Core technical specifications *techPowerUp!
