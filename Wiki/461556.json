 "text": "Polyenes are a type of organic compound. As the name says, they contain many (\"poly\") alkene groups (\"ene\"), double bonds between carbon atoms. Normally, the word \"polyene\" is used for chemicals with more than two double bonds. (If it only has two, it is a diene.) Most polyenes contain one or more arrangements of alternating double and single carbonâ€“carbon bonds. The electrons in these bonds can move more freely, which makes the molecule overall more stable in a process called conjugation. Category:Alkenes",
