Wild Orchid deals with stalking, deception and blackmail in Rio de Janeiro. The first version of the movie was too sexual for an R rating. The MPAA threatened give the movie an X rating. King edited the movie down to get the R rating. The movie got very bad reviews by critics, including Roger Ebert, but it was successful in terms of international box office earnings. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1989 romantic drama movies Category:American romantic drama movies Category:1980s English- language movies Category:Rio de Janeiro",
