 "text": "The historical fort of Agra is located in the Indian city of Agra. It was constructed by delhi sultans. Up until the Mughals seized it during the Mughal Dynasty, until 1638, when the capital was moved from Agra to Delhi, it served as the primary palace for the Sikarwar clan of Rajput monarchs. It was also known as \"Lal-Qila\",\"Fort Rouge\", and \"Qila-i-Akbari\".The Marathas were the last Indian kings to rule it before being taken by the British. The Agra Fort was officially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. It is located around 2.5 kilometers northwest of the Taj Mahal, its more well-known sibling structure. The walled city is a better way to characterize the fort. The past of Agra Fort before Mahmud Ghaznavi's assault is unknown, just like the rest of Agra. However, the Chauhan Rajputs took control of it in the 15th century. Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487â€“1517), who relocated his capital from Delhi to Agra and built a few structures in the already-existing Fort at Agra, gave that city its position as the nation's capital shortly after. The Mughals seized control of the fort and ruled from it after the First Battle of Panipat (1526 A.D.). Humayun was crowned there in A.D. 1530. Throughout the reign of Akbar, the fort acquired its current look. Currently, it serves as a tourist destination and is maintained by the government.
