 "text": "A regiment is a military unit made up of a number of battalions and a headquarters. It is under the command of a colonel or another officer. A modern regiment can also be similar to a brigade, in that both can be from a few hundred soldiers to 5,000 soldiers (from 3 to 7 battalions). The modern regiment's size changes in number, purpose, and role from country to country (and might not exist in some military forces) and sometimes even within the military of the same nations. In the United States Army, there are several different types of regiments including infantry, field artillery, cavalry, air defense and aviation. Each one has a headquarters with several companies assigned to them. In the United States Army there are several special regiments. These regiments include the 75th Rangers, The 3rd Infantry (The Old Guard) and the 160th Special Operations Aviation (Airborne) among others. ==Other websites == Category:Military organizations",
