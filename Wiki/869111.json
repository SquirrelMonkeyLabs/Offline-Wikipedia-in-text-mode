The race was won by Sergio Pérez of Racing Point, who took his first Formula One victory and Racing Point's only win as a constructor. Esteban Ocon finished second for the Renault team to claim his first podium in Formula One, while Pérez's teammate Lance Stroll finished third, giving Racing Point their only double podium finish as a constructor. Pérez became the first Mexican Formula One driver to win a race since Pedro Rodríguez won the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix. Racing Point became the first British constructor to win a race since Lotus F1 at the 2013 Australian Grand Prix. Recovering from a first-lap spin, Pérez won having inherited the lead on lap 64 of the race after longtime race leader George Russell fell foul of a pitstop error when Mercedes brought in both of their drivers under the Safety Car which was deployed on lap 62 after Jack Aitken who was substituting for him at Williams for this weekend spun and slammed into the wall on the main straight on the previous lap lap 61 which broke his front wing off and left debris on the circuit which initially forced the Virtual Safety Car (VSC) to be deployed so that the marshals could remove the debris safely, but on the following lap after the VSC had been deployed for roughly a minute, because a convenient gap in the on-circuit traffic could not be found in order to allow the marshals to come out onto the circuit to in order to remove the debris safely the Virtual Safety Car was then upgraded to a full Safety Car in order to create a convenient gap in the on-circuit traffic to allow the marshals to remove the debris safely before he then suffered a late puncture. With his win Perez also became the 1st ever Formula 1 driver to win a world championship grand prix after running in last place at the end of the opening lap of a world championship grand prix. Also as the race lasted for 87 laps the event had the highest lap count of a world championship grand prix since the Australian Grand Prix in 1995 which lasted for 81 laps. Russell drove for Mercedes at this event rather than for his usual team Williams because he substituted for World Champion Lewis Hamilton who was ruled out of the event 4 days before the event started because he was legally required to self-isolate for 7 days after he tested positive for COVID-19 just 1 day after he won the Bahrain Grand Prix on the previous day. The race also had 1 other Safety Car deployment which lasted from lap 1 to lap 6 after Charles Leclerc collided with Sergio Pérez as he tried to pass him at turn 4 and Max Verstappen then went off and slammed into the wall as he tried to avoid the damaged Ferrari and 1 other Virtual Safety Car (VSC) deployment which lasted for 90 seconds after it was deployed on lap 54 after Nicholas Latifi suffered electrical problems and stopped his car by a access road on the straight after turn 9 and ended on lap 55. Because of his enforced absence from this event after he tested positive for COVID-19, this was the first race without Lewis Hamilton since the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix and it was also the first race without Romain Grosjean since the 2012 Italian Grand Prix after he suffered severe burns to his hands and feet in a massive crash on the opening lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix which took place 7 days earlier when he collided with Daniil Kvyat as he tried to pass him coming out of turn 3 and he slammed heavily into the wall and the force of the impact with the armco barrier severed the barrier and tore his car in half before it then caught fire which forced the race to be red flagged for 81 minutes. Because of his injuries which also ruled him out of the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on the following weekend Haas's reserve driver Pietro Fittipaldi substituted for him at both this event and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix thus this meant that the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix would turn out to be his final Formula One Grand Prix before he announced his retirement from Formula 1 as he moved to compete in the IndyCar Series from 2021 onwards initially on a partial schedule for Dale Coyne Racing which excluded the oval events because of the negative memories of his massive crash at the Bahrain Grand Prix in 2020 which left him with severe burns to his hands and feet. By substituting for the injured Grosjean at Haas for this event Pietro Fittipaldi became the fifth different member of his family to have started a world championship Formula One Grand Prix after his maternal grandfather and 2 time Formula 1 world champion Emerson Fittipaldi, his great-uncle Wilson Fittipaldi (Emerson's brother), his second cousin Christian Fittipaldi (Wilson's son) and his uncle Max Papis (Emerson's son-in-law because he is married to his youngest daughter from his first marriage Tatiana). At this event Russell's Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas who took pole position at this event with a time of 53.377 seconds broke the record for the fastest ever pole position lap time at any world championship grand prix in Formula 1 which was previously held by Niki Lauda at the French Grand Prix in 1974 when he took pole position at that event with a time of 58.79 seconds. This marked only the 2nd time in Formula 1 history since the Formula 1 World Championship started in 1950 that a driver took pole position for a world championship grand prix with a lap time of less than 1 minute. == Qualifying classification == Driver Constructor Q1 Q2 Q3 1 77 Valtteri Bottas Mercedes 0:53.904 0:53.803 0:53.377 1 2 63 George Russell Mercedes 0:54.160 0:53.819 0:53.403 2 3 33 Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing-Honda 0:54.037 0:53.647 0:53.433 3 4 16 Charles Leclerc Ferrari 0:54.249 0:53.825 0:53.613 4 5 11 Sergio Pérez 0:54.236 0:53.787 0:53.790 5 6 26 Daniil Kvyat AlphaTauri- Honda 0:54.346 0:53.856 0:53.906 6 7 3 Daniel Ricciardo Renault 0:54.388 0:53.871 0:53.957 7 8 55 Carlos Sainz Jr. McLaren-Renault 0:54.450 0:53.818 0:54.010 8 9 10 Pierre Gasly AlphaTauri-Honda 0:54.207 0:53.941 0:54.154 9 10 18 Lance Stroll 0:54.595 0:53.840 0:54.200 10 11 31 Esteban Ocon Renault 0:54.309 0:53.995 N/A 11 12 23 Alex Albon Red Bull Racing-Honda 0:54.620 0:54.026 N/A 12 13 5 Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 0:54.301 0:54.175 N/A 13 14 99 Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari 0:54.523 0:54.377 N/A 14 15 4 Lando Norris McLaren- Renault 0:54.194 0:54.693 N/A 19 16 20 Kevin Magnussen Haas-Ferrari 0:54.705 N/A N/A 15 17 6 Nicholas Latifi Williams-Mercedes 0:54.796 N/A N/A 16 18 89 Jack Aitken Williams-Mercedes 0:54.892 N/A N/A 17 19 7 Kimi Räikkönen Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari 0:54.963 N/A N/A 18 20 51 Pietro Fittipaldi Haas-Ferrari 0:55.426 N/A N/A 20 107% time: 0:57.677 Source: == Race classification == Driver Constructor Time/Retired Points 1 11 Sergio Pérez 87 1:31:15.114 5 25 2 31 Esteban Ocon Renault 87 +10.518 11 18 3 18 Lance Stroll 87 +11.869 10 15 4 55 Carlos Sainz Jr. McLaren-Renault 87 +12.580 8 12 5 3 Daniel Ricciardo Renault 87 +13.330 7 10 6 23 Alex Albon Red Bull Racing-Honda 87 +13.842 12 8 7 26 Daniil Kvyat AlphaTauri-Honda 87 +14.534 6 6 8 77 Valtteri Bottas Mercedes 87 +15.389 1 4 9 63 George Russell Mercedes 87 +18.556 2 3 10 4 Lando Norris McLaren-Renault 87 +19.541 19 1 11 10 Pierre Gasly AlphaTauri-Honda 87 +20.527 9 12 5 Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 87 +22.611 13 13 99 Alfa Romeo Racing- Ferrari 87 +24.111 14 14 7 Kimi Räikkönen Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari 87 +26.153 18 15 20 Kevin Magnussen Haas-Ferrari 87 +32.370 15 16 89 Jack Aitken Williams-Mercedes 87 +33.674 17 17 51 Pietro Fittipaldi Haas-Ferrari 87 +36.858 20 Ret 6 Nicholas Latifi Williams-Mercedes 52 Oil leak 16 Ret 33 Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing-Honda 0 Accident 3 Ret 16 Charles Leclerc Ferrari 0 Collision 4 Fastest lap: George Russell (Mercedes) – 0:55.404 (lap 80) Source: ; Notes: ; – Includes one point for fastest lap. == References == == Notes == Category:Formula One Grands Prix Category:2020 in sports Category:2020s in motorsport",
