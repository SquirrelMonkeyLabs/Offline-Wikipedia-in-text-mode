Cn Nh Fl Mc Lv Ts Og An example of a periodic table dividing line, shown in the s- and p-blocks. The dividing line between metals and nonmetals is a stair-shaped line on the periodic table which separates chemical elements into metals and nonmetals. There is no formal definition of \"metal\" in chemistry. This line is a convention, and not a firm scientific rule. Most of the elements close to the line are called metalloids, because they have some things in common with metals and other things with nonmetals. Category:Periodic table",
