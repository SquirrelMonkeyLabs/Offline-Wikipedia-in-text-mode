 "text": "The Qubo Night Owl was a programming block at night that ran from 12AM to 6AM (Eastern Time). Originally the block was similar to Nick at Nite, as it was aimed at adults who grew up on the Filmation slate (He-Man, She-Ra, Ghostbusters, and BraveStarr), with newer shows airing at the tail end. In August 2013, however, the contract for the Filmation shows lapsed and newer acquisitions filled the block. The block suffered network decay (or in this case, \"block decay\") for most of its run, adding preschool shows and shows for older kids that would be normally seen during the daytime hours as opposed to the undesirable graveyard slots. After five and a half years of abandoning its original focus, the block appeared for the final time on January 7, 2019 as it was replaced with infomercials the following day, marking the first time the channel has followed the trope of networks airing infomercials during the graveyard hours (even though it was stated in a 2010 sizzle reel that they would never do such a thing, proving further that time does fly by fast in a decade). From the screen bug for Qubo Night Owl only appeared during the midnight hour (when Sidekick, Zoo Clues and Safari Tracks usually aired at the time). As of June 17, 2019, the Qubo Night Owl screenbug no longer appears. Category:Television programming blocks in the United States",
