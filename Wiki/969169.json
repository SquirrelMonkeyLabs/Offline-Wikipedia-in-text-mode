 "text": "The 2022 Nord Stream gas leaks were a series of explosions and underwater gas leaks that happened on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines on 26 September 2022. Both pipeline pairs were built to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. The leaks happened as the Baltic Pipe was being opened for natural gas to come in from the North Sea through Denmark to Poland. == Background == In 2021, Russia was one of the largest suppliers of natural gas to the countries that are members of the European Union. The United States has been a powerful opponent of both Nord Stream pipelines. == Cause == The explosions and gas leaks were caused by sabotage. === Investigations === The nearby countries Germany, Sweden and Denmark have each investigated the sabotage. they have not publicly accused anyone of doing it. On 27 April 2023 Denmark's military confirmed that six ships from the Russian navy had been observed in the area of the sabotage four days before it happened. One of the ships can launch a mini-submarine. ==References== Category:2022 disasters in Europe Category:2022 in Denmark Category:September 2022 events Category:Baltic Sea",
