 "text": "A series finale is the last installment of a television series before the series is removed. These terms refer to an intentionally planned ending, rather than one in which the series is unexpectedly cancelled after the last episode is produced. Episodes labeled \"series finale,\" or ones leading up to it, often include remarkable events in the overall series story arc. An extended length episode, or television or theatrical film may serve as the series finale. The finale may also be used as a device to create a spin-off series. ==Related pages== * Season finale ==Other websites== * TV Series Finale - site devoted to final episodes and life after the shows Category:Television series",
