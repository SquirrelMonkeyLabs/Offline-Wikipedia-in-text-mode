 "text": "Eternal Sunshine is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Ariana Grande. It was released on March 8, 2024, by Republic Records. Grande, a big fan of Canadian actor Jim Carrey, referenced his movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) with the album's title. It is her first album to be released since Positions (2020). The album features more of a pop, house and R&B; sound compared to her other albums, which are more urban sounding. == Singles == The lead single, \"Yes, And?\", was released on January 12, 2024. It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, becoming Grande's eighth US number-one hit. It is a house and dance-pop song, and the video references Paula Abdul's music video for \"Cold Hearted\" (1989). The second single, \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)\" was released with the album on March 8, 2024. It is a synth-pop and electropop song, and the video references Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Like \"Yes, And?\", \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)\" also entered at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. It became Grande's ninth US number-one song. The song also marks a chart double, with Grande having the number-one album and song in the same week. It was her first since Thank U, Next and \"7 Rings\" in 2019. ==Commercial performance== On March 17, 2024, Billboard announced that Eternal Sunshine debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 227,000 units streamed/sold. At that point in time, it was the highest first-week sales of 2024. It became Grande's sixth US number-one album. ==Track listing== {{Track listing | headline = Eternal Sunshine – standard edition | extra_column = Producer(s) | title_width = 30% | lyrics_width = 25% | music_width = 25% | extra_width = 20% | title1 = Intro (End of the World) | lyrics1 = Ariana Grande | music1 = | extra1 = | length1 = 1:32 | title2 = Bye | lyrics2 = | music2 = | extra2 = | length2 = 2:44 | title3 = Don't Wanna Break Up Again | lyrics3 = | music3 = | extra3 = | length3 = 2:54 | title4 = Saturn Returns Interlude | lyrics4 = Diana Garland | music4 = | extra4 = | length4 = 0:42 | title5 = Eternal Sunshine | lyrics5 = Grande | music5 = | extra5 = | length5 = 3:30 | title6 = Supernatural | lyrics6 = Grande | music6 = | extra6 = | length6 = 2:43 | title7 = True Story | lyrics7 = | music7 = | extra7 = | length7 = 2:43 | title8 = The Boy Is Mine | lyrics8 = | music8 = | extra8 = | length8 = 2:53 | title9 = Yes, And? | lyrics9 = Grande | music9 = | extra9 = | length9 = 3:34 | title10 = We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) | lyrics10 = Grande | music10 = | extra10 = | length10 = 3:48 | title11 = I Wish I Hated You | lyrics11 = Grande | music11 = | extra11 = | length11 = 2:33 | title12 = Imperfect for You | lyrics12 = | music12 = | extra12 = | length12 = 3:02 | title13 = Ordinary Things | note13 = featuring Nonna | lyrics13 = | music13 = | extra13 = | length13 = 2:48 | total_length = 35:26 }} ; Notes * All track titles except \"Saturn Returns Interlude\" are stylized in all lowercase. * \"Saturn Return Interlude\" contains an excerpt from astrologist Diana Garland. ==Personnel== Musicians * Ariana Grande – lead vocals, background vocals (all tracks); programming (track 4) * Shintaro Yasuda – keyboards, programming (tracks 1, 5, 8); drums (5, 8) * Nick Lee – keyboards, programming, trombone (tracks 1, 13); bass, drums (13) * Aaron Cheung – bass, guitar, programming, synthesizer, violin (track 1) * Max Martin – keyboards (tracks 2, 3, 5–10, 12); background vocals, bass, drums (tracks 2, 3, 5, 7–10, 12); guitar (tracks 2, 7, 10, 12), programming (tracks 3, 5–10, 12) * Ilya – background vocals, bass, keyboards, programming (tracks 2–5, 7–12); guitar (2, 7, 10, 12), synthesizer (track 3), piano (tracks 5, 9) * Mattias Bylund – string arrangement, strings, synthesizer (tracks 2, 3); glockenspiel, horns (track 2) * Tomas Jonsson – tenor saxophone (tracks 2, 3) * Peter Jonasson – trombone (tracks 2, 3) * Magnus Johansson – trumpet, violin (tracks 2, 3) * Karl Guner – string arrangement, synthesizer (tracks 2, 3) * Janne Bjerger – trumpet (tracks 2, 3) * Hanna Helgegren – violin (tracks 2, 3) * Erik Arvinder – violin (tracks 2, 3) * Wojtek Goral – alto saxophone (track 2) * Michael Engström – bass (track 2) * Lou Carrao – bass (track 2) * David Bukovinszky – cello (track 2) * Per Strandberg – guitar (track 2) * Davidior – keyboards (track 5); drums, programming (track 8) * Oscar Görres – bass, guitar, keyboards, percussion, programming (track 6) * Shellback – drums (track 7) * Davide Rossi – cello, string arrangement, viola, violin (track 10) * Luka Kloser – bass, drums, keyboards, programming (track 13) * Troye Sivan – featured artist (track 14, 15) * Mariah Carey – featured artist (track 17, 14) * Brandy - featured artist (track 16) * Monica - featured artist (track 16) Technical * Randy Merrill – mastering * Serban Ghenea – mixing (tracks 1–3, 5–13) * Ilya – mixing (track 4) * Sam Holland – engineering * Lou Carrao – engineering * Bryce Bordone – mixing assistance (tracks 1–3, 5–13) * Eric Eyland – engineering assistance * Rob Sellens – engineering assistance (tracks 2–5, 7–13) == Charts == ===Weekly charts=== Weekly chart performance for Eternal Sunshine Chart (2024) Peak position Argentine Albums (CAPIF) 1 Croatian International Albums (HDU) 1 Greek Albums (IFPI) 3 Icelandic Albums (Tónlistinn) 3 Japanese Combined Albums (Oricon) 14 Japanese Hot Albums (Billboard Japan) 14 Lithuanian Albums (AGATA) 2 Nigerian Albums (TurnTable) 96 Slovak Albums (ČNS IFPI) 3 ===Monthly charts=== Monthly chart performance for Eternal Sunshine Chart (2024) Position Japanese Albums (Oricon) 41 ===Year-end charts=== 2024 year-end chart performance of Eternal Sunshine Chart (2024) Position Canadian Albums (Billboard) 27 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) 61 New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) 11 US Billboard 200 23 ==Certifications== == Release history == Release history for Eternal Sunshine Region Date Format(s) Version Label Various March 8, 2024 Standard Republic Citations concerning Eternal Sunshine release formats: * * * * United States March 8, 2024 Vinyl Target exclusive March 10, 2024 Digital download Slightly Deluxe Various March 11, 2024 Streaming Various October 1, 2024 Slightly Deluxe and Also Live ==References== Category:2024 albums Category:Ariana Grande albums Category:Pop albums Category:House albums Category:R&B; albums",
