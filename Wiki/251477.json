 "text": "Ogden, Utah is a city in Weber County, Utah, USA with a population of 87,321 as of the 2020 census. Ogden was originally named Fort Buenaventura. Fort Buenaventura was the first permanent settlement by people whose families came from Europe in the U.S. state now known as Utah. A trapper named Miles Goodyear established it in 1846 a mile west of present downtown Ogden. Then a year later, the fort was bought by Mormon settlers for about $2,000. Brownsville is another name that was once used for the settlement. When the area was renamed, it was named after Peter Skene Ogden, a Hudson Bay Company leader who trapped animals for fur in the Weber Valley. Ogden is the county seat of Weber County. It lies to the east of the Great Salt Lake, the west of the Wasatch Front mountain range, and is basically north of Salt Lake City. Weber State University is located in Ogden.
