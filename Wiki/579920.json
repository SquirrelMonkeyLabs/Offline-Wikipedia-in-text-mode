 "text": "A capstan is a machine that is used on sailing ships to pull ropes and cables (also called hawsers). It has a vertical axle, and is very much like the windlass, which has a horizontal axle. Grip on power pull capstan and it's opposite brakeforce on bollard posts; both work thru Capstan Equation Man powered capstan is a 2nd Class Lever concentrating man force inwards to smaller radius for more power from levers. Motor powered capstan spins motor shaft from inside post/not outside levers so is a 3rd Class Lever delivering force wider radius than motor shaft force input.
