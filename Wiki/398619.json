 "text": "Outrigger skis are skis that are used by para-skiers to help with balance, turn, control their rate of motion, stop and make easier the direction of turns. They be different in size and level, and have different things. Being dependent on the total number of skis used by the skier (1 or 2), outrigger ski form is sometimes named \"Three Track Skiing\" or \"Four Track Skiing\". When falling, skiers are taught to move their arms to put a stop to falling on the outrigger ski and damaging themselves.
