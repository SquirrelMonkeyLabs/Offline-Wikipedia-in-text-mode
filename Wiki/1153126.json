 "text": "After the failure of Khan khana, Akbar sent Jagannath Kachhawa to crush Rana Pratapâ€™s increasing power, though initially seemed successful this campaign of Jagannath Kachhawa also resulted in a complete failure. ==Battle== Abdur Rahim Khan Khana was initially tasked with subduing Maharana Pratap, but after failing, Jagannath Kachhawa was assigned to lead a larger army to deal with him. On December 5, 1584, they set off from Fatehpur Sikri. When they reached Mandalgarh, Jagannath left part of the army there and continued the pursuit of Pratap, with his lieutenant Saiyid Raju joining with another portion of the army. Despite their efforts, they could not find the Rana and eventually left Mewar unsuccessful. A new attempt was made on September 17, 1585, when Jagannath Kachhawa led another campaign into Mewar. This time, the Mughal army invaded the hilly regions, plundered them, and reached Dungarpur, where they gathered a large amount of loot. However, they did not achieve any significant success in Mewar. After the Mughal forces withdrew, Maharana Pratap decided to regain control over regions like Chhapan and Vagad. He sent his commander, Rawat Bhan, to Sur Khan, where they successfully defeated the Mughal forces on the banks of the Som River. ==See Also== *Battle of Dewair *Khan Khana Invasion of Mewar *Battle of Haldighati == References == Category:Mewar",
