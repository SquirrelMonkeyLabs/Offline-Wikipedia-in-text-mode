 "text": "Hyloxalus delatorreae is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is 17.5–20.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 19.3–20.5 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is gray-brown in color. There is a line down the side of the body starting at the eye. This line is gold or creamy in color. The female frog has a white belly. The male frog's belly has white spots. There are two dark spots where the front legs meet the body. The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Name== Scientists named this frog after Stella de la Torre, who helped catch frogs of this and other species for scientists to study. ==Home== This frog lives in wet places, for example bogs. It also lives in places where people let cows eat grass if there are forests nearby. Some of them live near streams. People have seen this frog between 2340 and 2800 meters above sea level. ==Young== This frog has young between February and June. The female frogs lay eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to streams and ponds where they swim and grow. The tadpoles are dark brown in color. Some of the muscles are cream-white in color with brown marks. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People change the places where the frogs live to get wood to build with, to make places for cows to eat grass, and to make farms. Scientists think there are between 0 and 49 frogs alive now. They say changing even one marsh to something else could kill all of them. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also have killed many of these frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
