 "text": "The B-25 Empire State Building crash was a plane crash that occurred on July 28, 1945. On that date, a B-25 Mitchell plane in heavy fog crashed into the Empire State Building in New York City. It caused 14 deaths (three people in the plane and eleven people in the building). It caused damage of around $1 million. The plane crashed between the 78th and 80th floors of the building, leaving a 18 ft (5.5 m) by 20 ft (6.1 m) hole in the building. The fire that was started was put out in 40 minutes. It is the only fire at such a height that has been successfully put out. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver survived a fall of 75 floors, which is the Guinness World Record for the longest fall survived in an elevator. The building was reopened the Monday after the crash. ==References== ==Other websites== *On This Day in Aviation History: July 28th *Video Footage Category:1945 in the United States Category:1940s in New York (state) Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States Category:Disasters in the 1940s Category:History of Manhattan Category:20th century in New York City",
