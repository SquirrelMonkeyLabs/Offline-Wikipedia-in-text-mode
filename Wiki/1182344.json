 "text": "Hilde Mangold was a German embryologist whose research was the first to show that there is a center in an embryo that controls the development of organs and tissues. Mangold received a good education for a woman of her time and studied zoology at the University of Frankfurt. She began her doctorate at only age 21, conducting research with Hans Spemann from 1920 to 1923. The research on newt embryos that she did with Spemann led to a Nobel Prize. Mangold tragically passed away in 1924 at only age 25 so only Spemann received the prize. At the University of Freiburg, a cast of her gravestone hangs in the zoology building and she has a building named after her at the University as well. The original slides of her experiment are archived at the Berlin Museum of Natural History. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2025",
