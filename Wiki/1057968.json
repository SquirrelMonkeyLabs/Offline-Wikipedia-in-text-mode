 "text": "The WAGR R class were a total of 24 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1897 to 1953. All of the R class were built by DÃ¼bs & Coy of Glasgow, Scotland in several batches from 1896 to 1898. They initially served on the Eastern Railway, Eastern Goldfields Railway, and Northern Railway as premier express locomotives hauling passengers and mail. They were later relegated to mixed work, with some being converted to Ra class engines to serve on lighter-laid lines. No. 174 became famous for aiding in the rescue of a trapped miner and upon its withdrawal in 1947 it was preserved by the Midland Railway Institute, it was displayed at various locations in Midland before moving permanently to the ARHS Rail Heritage W.A. Bassendean Railway Museum, where it is presently displayed. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
