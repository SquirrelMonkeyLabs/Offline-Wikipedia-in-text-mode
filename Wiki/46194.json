 "text": "When a piece of music is in a major key, the relative minor means the minor key which has the same key signature. It can be found by taking the sixth note of the first scale and playing a minor scale starting on that note. For example: in C major the sixth note is an A. Therefore, A minor is the relative minor of C major (C major and A minor share the same key signature: no sharps or flats). C major is called the relative major of A minor. A complete list of relative minor/major pairs in order of the circle of fifths is: Key signature Major key Minor key B\\flat, E\\flat, A\\flat, D\\flat, G\\flat, C\\flat, F\\flat C flat major A flat minor B\\flat, E\\flat, A\\flat, D\\flat, G\\flat, C\\flat G flat major E flat minor B\\flat, E\\flat, A\\flat, D\\flat, G\\flat D flat major B flat minor B\\flat, E\\flat, A\\flat, D\\flat A flat major F minor B\\flat, E\\flat, A\\flat E flat major C minor B\\flat, E\\flat B flat major G minor B\\flat F major D minor C major A minor F\\sharp G major E minor F\\sharp, C\\sharp D major B minor F\\sharp, C\\sharp, G\\sharp A major F sharp minor F\\sharp, C\\sharp, G\\sharp, D\\sharp E major C sharp minor F\\sharp, C\\sharp, G\\sharp, D\\sharp, A\\sharp B major G sharp minor F\\sharp, C\\sharp, G\\sharp, D\\sharp, A\\sharp, E\\sharp F sharp major D sharp minor F\\sharp, C\\sharp, G\\sharp, D\\sharp, A\\sharp, E\\sharp, B\\sharp C sharp major A sharp minor ==Related pages== * Modulation (music) * scale (music) * Circle of fifths Category:Music theory",
