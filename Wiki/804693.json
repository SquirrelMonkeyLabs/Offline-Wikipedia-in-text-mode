 "text": "Pearson's correlation is a mathematical formula for calculating the correlation coefficients between two datasets. Most computer programs have a command to calculate this such as CORREL(dataset x: dataset y). The coefficient can be calculated by * Step 1: Find the mean of x, and the mean of y * Step 2: Subtract the mean of x from every x value (call them \"a\"), and subtract the mean of y from every y value (call them \"b\") * Step 3: Calculate: ab, a2 and b2 for every value * Step 4: Sum up ab, sum up a2 and sum up b2 * Step 5: Divide the sum of ab by the square root of [(sum of a2) Ã— (sum of b2)] Karl Pearson came up with the formula in the 1880s when he contributed to research in statistics.
