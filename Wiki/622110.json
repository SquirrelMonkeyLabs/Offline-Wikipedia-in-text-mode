 "text": "The Christmas fern, Polystichum acrostichoides, is an evergreen fern. It grows mostly in the eastern part of the United States. Christmas fern usually grows in dense woods and rocky mountains. The name supposedly comes from the plant being still lush and green around Christmas. They usually grow around one to two feet (30 to 60 cm) tall. Their fronds grow in circular clumps. == References == Category:Pteridophyta",
