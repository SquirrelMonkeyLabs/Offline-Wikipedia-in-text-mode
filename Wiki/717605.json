 "text": "The President of Nicaragua () officially known as the President of the Republic of Nicaragua () is the head of state of Nicaragua. The office was created in the Constitution of 1854. From 1825 until the Constitution of 1838, the head of state of Nicaragua was known simply as Head of State (Jefe de Estado). In 2025, the Constitution of Nicaragua was amended to provide for the powers of the presidency to be exercised by two co-presidents rather than a single officeholder. A male and female co-president are elected by universal suffrage to a six-year term. When the amendment was passed, the incumbent president Daniel Ortega and his wife and vice-president Rosario Murillo were declared to be the inaugural co-presidents. Ortega had previously served as president since 2007.\"Nicaragua's Ortega takes office\", BBC News, 11 January 2007. ==Heads of state of Nicaragua== ===Heads of the state of Nicaragua within the Federal Republic of Central America (1822–1838)=== Name Political party Dates in office Notes Manuel Antonio de la Cerda Conservative Federalist 22 April 1825 – 22 April 1826 1st time, from León.
