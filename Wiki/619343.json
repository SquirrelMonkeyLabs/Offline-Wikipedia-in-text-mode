The service was complimentary and available exclusively to guests with reservations at one of 21 Walt Disney World Resort hotels. In 2015, Universal Orlando, Disney's main competitor in the area, announced their own airport shuttle to their resort. The Universal service is operated by SuperShuttle, costs $35 round-trip, and has guests take care of their own luggage. As of January 1st, 2022, Disney World has announced the discontinuation of the Magical Express service, leaving guests without this transportation option. == Participating Airlines == * Air Canada * Alaska Airlines * American Airlines * Delta Air Lines * JetBlue Airways * Southwest Airlines * United Airlines == Former Participating Airlines == *America West Airlines (merged with US Airways) *Northwest (merged with Delta) *Song (2006) (folded back into Delta) *Ted (2008) (folded back into United) *Continental Airlines (merged with United) *AirTran Airways (bought by Southwest) *US Airways (merged with American) ==References== Category:Bus transport Category:The Walt Disney Company",
