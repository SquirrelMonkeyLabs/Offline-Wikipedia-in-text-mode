 "text": "The WAGR Xa class were a total of 16 diesel-electric locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1955 to 1988. The Xa class resulted from fitting dual air braking to the standard X class, this was done to allow them to operate salt trains on the Esperance branch, with braking systems manufactured by Davies & Metcalfe Ltd of Manchester, England. Two were converted to Xa to work with Queensland Rail SX class carriages hired by the WAGR for suburban services. Five of the Xa class are preserved in various locations including the Hotham Valley Railway, Bassendean Railway Museum, and at Narrogin. == Gallery == File:XA1416.jpg|No. 1416 Niligara at Bunbury yard, ca. 1970s.
