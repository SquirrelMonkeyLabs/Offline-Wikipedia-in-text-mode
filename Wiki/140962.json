It was created to publish sales by new and developing musical recording artists. Albums that appear on Top Heatseekers may also appear on the Billboard 200 at the same time. Top Heatseekers contains fifty chart positions.\"Top Heatseekers \". Billboard. Retrieved on November 11, 2008.

If an album on Heatseekers does enter the top 100 of the Billboard 200, it and any albums the act later releases are not eligible to appear on the Heatseekers chart.Caulfield, Keith (February 26, 2008). \"Ask Billboard \".
