 "text": "SJ (formally SJ AB) is a government-owned passenger train operator in Sweden. It was created in 2001, out of the public transport division of Statens Järnvägar. That was a government agency. It was divided into six separate government-owned limited companies. In 2018, SJ carried 31.8 million passengers. ==Overview== SJ's runs both subsidised and unsubsidised services. . The subsidised trains are awarded through competitive bids. However, some trains fall in between these categories, since public transit agencies can pay SJ to allow transit pass holders to use SJ's trains. SJ received a government bailout a few years after its creation, but has since had profit margins of up to 10 %. All train operators in Sweden pay low track access charges to the track authority, Trafikverket. ==References== Category:Rail transport in Sweden Category:Companies of Sweden Category:State-owned enterprises Category:Railway companies Category:2001 establishments in Sweden",
