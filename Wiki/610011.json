It stars Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer, Mark Wahlberg, Romain Duris, Charlie Plummer, Stacy Martin, Andrew Buchan, and Timothy Hutton. The movie tells the story of how J. Paul Getty refused to cooperate with the group of kidnappers, from the organized crime Mafia group 'Ndrangheta, who kidnapped his grandson John Paul Getty III in the 1970s.

Though re-shoots began on November 20, 2017, TriStar Pictures has the movie's United States release scheduled for December 22, 2017, but moved the date to December 25. For their roles, Williams and Plummer are nominated for a Golden Globe Award with Plummer being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2017 crime drama movies Category:2010s American crime drama movies Category:British crime drama movies Category:2010s English-language movies Category:J.
