 "text": "Heligoland (; ) is a small German group of islands in the North Sea.. It has been controlled by Denmark and between 1807 and 1890 by the British. The islands have a population of 1,650. They are the only German islands not nearby to the mainland and are about two hours' sailing time from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe. == Geography == Heligoland is located 70 km (44 miles) from the German coast line and actually consists of two islands: the populated triangular-shaped 1 km² (0.4 sq mi) main island () to the west and the island of Düne (Heligolandic: de Halem) in the east. Düne is the smaller of the two islands(0.7 km²). It is also lower, surrounded by sand beaches and no-one lives on the island throughout the year. Often when people talk about \"Heligoland\" they only mean Hauptinsel. ==References== == Other websites == *Heligoland Tourist Board — includes an aerial photograph of Heligoland (front) and Düne (back). *Site about planting palms on Heligoland *Heligoland Web Cams Category:Geography of Schleswig-Holstein Category:Islands of Germany",
