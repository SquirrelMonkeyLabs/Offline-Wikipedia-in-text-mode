 "text": "MV Mont Louis was a 1972 Finnish-built French roll-on/roll-off cargo ship. In August 1984 she was en voyage with 30 drums of uranium hexafluoride, an intermediate substance in the process of uranium enrichment, towards Riga, Latvia. In misty weather, with severely reducing visibility, she collided with the German ferry Olau Britannia on 25 August 1984, 15 kilometres off the coast of Ostend. The bow of Olau Britannia went for six metres into the side of Mont Louis and water poured into the engines of Mont Louis. After the German ferry was pulled away, Mont Louis started to list. The ship tipped onto its side and sank into the 14 metres deep water. As oil had leaked into the water, the Belgian Navy sprayed 28,000 litres of dispersant. The sinking had a major concern as it was transporting hazardous substances that could elevate the level of radioactivity in the area. In the month after the accident, all drums of uranium hexafluoride were recovered. Investigation turned out that the Mont Louis was responsible for the accident due to human errors by the commanding officer and the first lieutenant. ==References== Category:Ships Category:1972 Category:1984 events Category:West Flanders",
