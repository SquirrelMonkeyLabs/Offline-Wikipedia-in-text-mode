 "text": "In string theory and theoretical physics, strings are hypothetical objects that are believed to be the elementary particles of the universe. If they exist, they would not be point-like particles, but rather 1-dimensional \"strings\" of energy that vibrate in various dimensions. The image to the right illustrates the various possible dimensions that a string could vibrate in. (Currently, physicists accept the fact that there are at least 11 dimensions in our universe: 1 time dimension and 10 spatial dimensions.) The length of the strings would be determined by Planck length: :e_p=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar G}{c^3}} It is still not known whether these strings actually exist. They are pretty much the main topic of string theory. ==Related pages== *String theory *Calabi-Yau manifold *M-theory Category:String theory",
