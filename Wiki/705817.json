Its first complete redesign CPU (called NetBurst) since the processor Pentium Pro, released in 1995. Compared to the Pentium II, Pentium III and Celeron processors, its architecture is little similar to the Pentium Pro/P6 processor design. The NetBurst microarchitecture contains a very deep instruction pipeline to be able to achieve very high frequencies. The Pentium 4 was known for being inefficient and producing a large amount of heat. Because of this, Intel introduced the Core 2 in 2006. Intel stopped making the Pentium 4 in 2008.
