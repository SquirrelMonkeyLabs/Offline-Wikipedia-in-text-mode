 "text": "The Transamerica Pyramid is the second tallest skyscraper in the San Francisco skyline and one of its most iconic. The building is the headquarters of the Transamerica Corporation, it is still strongly part of the company and is part of the company's logo. Designed by architect William Pereira and built by Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company, at 260 m (850 ft). When the building was finished in 1972 it was among the five tallest buildings in the world. The tower has no public access except for the first floor lobby, so this means that visitors cannot go to the top for a skyline view. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Pyramid Center official website * About the Pyramid - Transamerica Corporation * Transamerica Pyramid at PropertyShark Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 20th century Category:Buildings and structures in San Francisco Category:Skyscrapers in the United States Category:Landmarks in San Francisco Category:1972 establishments in California",
