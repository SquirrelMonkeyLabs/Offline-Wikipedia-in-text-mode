 "text": "On 23 March 2018, there was a series of Islamist terrorist attacks in the towns of Carcassonne and Trèbes in southern France. ==Background== Redouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old French-Moroccan, shot the two occupants of a car in Carcassonne, killing the passenger and hijacking it. He then opened fire on four police officers, seriously wounding one. Lakdim drove to nearby Trèbes, where he stormed a Super U supermarket, killing two civilians, wounding others, and taking at least one hostage. A senior gendarme, Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, voluntarily swapped places with a hostage. After a three-hour stand- off, Lakdim fatally shot and stabbed Beltrame. A police tactical unit immediately stormed the building and killed Lakdim. He was named a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" by the Amaq News Agency, and the President of France called the attacks an act of Islamist terrorism. ==Motive== Lakdim swore allegiance to the Islamic State and demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving suspect of the November 2015 Paris attacks. ==Aftermath== Five people were killed in the attacks, including the perpetrator, and fifteen were wounded. For his actions, Beltrame was hailed as a hero. Macron said that Beltrame deserved \"the respect and admiration of the whole nation.\". ==References== Category:2018 crimes in Europe Category:2010s crimes in France Category:2010s murders in Europe Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in Europe Category:March 2018 events Category:Murder in 2018 Category:Murder in France Category:Terrorist incidents in 2018 Category:Terrorist incidents in France Category:2018 in France Category:Carcassonne",
