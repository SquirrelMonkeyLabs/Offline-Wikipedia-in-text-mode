He further wrote that the movie was \"so ruthless in its exploitation of Miss Temple's great talent for infant charm that it seldom succeeds in being properly lively and gay\". He finished his review noting the audience applauded for a full eleven seconds after the final fade- out, and that the movie \"ought to bring out the best in every one who sees it.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Annie Fellows Johnston and the Little Colonel * Kate Matthews Collection (includes illustrations for The Little Colonel books by Johnston's friend and neighbor, photographer Kate Matthews) * * Category:Movies based on books Category:1935 comedy movies Category:1935 musical movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies directed by David Butler",
