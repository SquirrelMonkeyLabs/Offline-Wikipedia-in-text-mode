 "text": "Barbaridactylus is an extinct genus of nyctosaurid pterosaur from Maastrichtian/Danian-aged rocks from the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. It was one of six new Maastriichtian/Danian-aged pterosaurs described in 2018. Two of these pterosaurs are yet to be named. ==Description== Barbaridactylus was probably a slender pterosaur. Its arm and wing bones were averagely sized for a pterosaur of its time. ==Discovery and naming== Barbaridactylus was described based from two specimens. The first specimen consisted of a partial jaw, a single neck vertebra, part of the arm and wing bones and the left thigh bone. The second specimen (catalogued as USM93000) consists of a well preserved skeleton. ==Paleoecology== Barbaridactylus was discovered in the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. It coexisted with the pterosaurs Alcione, Simurghia, Tethydraco and Phospatodraco and the dinosaur Chenanisaurus. ==References== Category:Pterosaurs",
