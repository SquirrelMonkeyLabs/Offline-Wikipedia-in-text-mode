 "text": "Deadpool & Wolverine is a 2024 American superhero comedy movie. It was released on July 26, 2024 in North America. It is based on the Marvel Comics character Deadpool. It is the sequel to Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018) and the 34th movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It is the first Deadpool movie to be a part of the MCU. It was directed by Shawn Levy. Principal photography for the movie started in London, England on May 22, 2023 and ended on January 24, 2024. Filming was delayed because of the 2023 SAG- AFTRA strike. During development of the third Deadpool movie, their studio 21st Century Fox was purchased by The Walt Disney Company and it caused delays until the deal was completed. After the purchase, Deadpool would be transferred to the MCU. It would also keep its R rating. Ryan Reynolds would describe the movie as a road trip-type movie and would also feature Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It is Jackman's first time playing Wolverine since Logan in 2017. Deadpool and Wolverine was the first Marvel movie to be released on home video by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment after the closure of Disney's home video business. == Plot == Wade Wilson of Earth-10005 uses Cable's time- traveling device to travel to Earth-616, the \"Sacred Timeline\" in 2018, where he attempts to join the Avengers, but he is rejected. In 2024, Wade Wilson has retired from being the masked mercenary known as Deadpool after breaking up with his girlfriend Vanessa. During his birthday party, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) captures Wilson and delivers him to Mr. Paradox, who offers him to join Earth-616. However, Paradox also reveals that Wilson's timeline would deteriorate as a result of the death of James \"Logan\" Howlett, who is revealed to be the timeline's \"anchor being\". Wilson steals Paradox's TemPad to travel the multiverse and find a variant of Logan to save his timeline. After encountering various Logan variants, Wilson takes one back to the TVA, where he learns that this particular Logan destroyed his own universe before Paradox prunes them both into the Void. Wilson and Logan fight before they and Johnny Storm are captured and sent to Cassandra Nova, who Logan knows as the twin sister of Charles Xavier. Upon arriving at Nova's lair, she kills Storm and tries to puzzle Wilson with the feeling of not being needed, before Alioth appears. Wilson and Logan escape before Alioth can consume them. Following their escape, Wilson and Logan are directed by a variant of Wilson to travel to the Void's borderlands to join the resistance against Nova and her forces, but Logan chastises Wilson for hiding the fact that Wilson knew how to return them to their original timelines. Arriving at the borderlands, Wilson and Logan meet the resistance members Elektra, Blade, Gambit, and X-23, nicknamed the \"Others\" by Wilson. The Others plan to team up with Wilson and Logan to confront Nova, but the latter refuses to cooperate, though he eventually relents after a conversation with X-23 about the tragic past making him the worst Wolverine in the multiverse. Logan joins the Others and confront Nova with Wilson. Nova has Logan mentally incapacitated, but Wilson places Juggernaut's helmet on her to block her powers. Pyro shoots Nova and reveals himself as Paradox's sleeper agent assigned to keep her inside the Void. Logan persuades Wilson to remove the helmet to allow Nova to heal, and guarantees that Xavier would help her if he knows she still exists. In exchange, Nova uses a sling ring from a Doctor Strange variant to open a portal for the duo to travel to Wade's timeline. Upon arriving on Earth-10005, Wilson and Logan find that Paradox is using the Time Ripper, a device Paradox developed to destroy Wilson's timeline without permission from his superior. Nova quickly learns this from the executed Pyro as well, as she arrives through another portal and kidnaps Paradox. Wilson and Logan battle the Deadpool Corps, an army of Deadpool variants coming from the portal, before Nova takes control of the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines as revenge for Paradox's betrayal. Paradox tells Wilson and Logan that one can disrupt the power flow of the Time Ripper at the cost of their life. Using their own bodies as a conductor, Wilson and Logan destroy both Nova and the Time Ripper, while Hunter C-20 arrests Paradox. The Others are returned to their respective timelines upon Wilson's request, while Logan is permitted to stay in Wilson's timeline, which no longer deteriorates. Logan hopes for a change of his past, but C-20 tells him that his past is what makes him the anchor needed to save Wilson's timeline, and there is no reason for further change. Logan chooses to retire and live a peaceful life. Before his departure, Wilson takes Logan to meet his friends, and X-23 is invited to the party as well. Encouraged by Logan, Wilson reconciles with Vanessa. In a post-credits scene, Wilson exposes footage of Storm saying the words that led to his murder by Nova. It’s followed by a tribute to Fox’s X-Men franchise. == Cast == * Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool * Hugh Jackman as James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine * Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova * Morena Baccarin as Vanessa * Rob Delaney as Peter * Leslie Uggams as Blind Al * Karan Soni as Dopinder * Matthew Macfadyen as Paradox * Brianna Hildebrand : Ellie Phimister / Negasonic Teenage Warhead * Jennifer Garner : Elektra Natchios * Leslie Uggams : Blind AI * Stefan Kapičić : Piotr Rasputin / Colossus (voice) * Lewis Tan : Rusty / Shatterstar * Karan Soni : Dopinder, taxi driver * Shiori Kutsuna : Yukio * Aaron Stanford : John Allerdyce / Pyro * Tyler Mane : Victor Creed * Ray Park : Mortimer Toynbee / the toad * Kelly Hu : Yuriko Oyama / Lady Deathstrike * Jason Flemyng : Azazel * Dania Ramírez : Callisto * Dafne Keen : Laura Kinney / X-23 * Blake Lively : Lady Deadpool * Wunmi Mosaku : Dr Verity Willis / Chasseuse B-15 * Jon Favreau : Happy Hogan * Randal Reeder : Buck * Greg Hemphill : a barman (caméo) * Ollie Palmer : a bar customs (caméo) * Rob McElhenney : Hunter of TVA (caméo) * Tony McCarthy : a barman (caméo) * Chris Hemsworth : Thor (Thor: The Dark World) * Peggy : Dogpool, variant dog of Deadpool * Mark Ruffalo: Hulk, variant (caméo) == Release == Deadpool & Wolverine had its world premiere in New York City.
