For away games, it played in red shirts and white shorts in 2013/14, but has played in colours such as green, yellow or black. The team's away kit in 2014 is navy with orange sleeves. Shahid Khan owns the club. He is from the United States, and also owns the Jacksonville Jaguars, a famous NFL team. == History == The club was made in 1879 as Fulham St. Andrews. Lots of famous players used to play for Fulham, like Johnny Haynes (1950s), Bobby Moore (1970s), George Best (1970s) and Edwin van der Sar (2000s). Fulham have won one international tournament; the Intertoto Cup in 2003. They also were runner-up of the 2009-10 UEFA Europe League. They lost to Atletico Madrid in the final. When Mohamed Al-Fayed bought Fulham in 1997, it was in the 3rd division of English football Football League One. He put lots of money into the club, and he made good choices about the club. The club won promotion two times, which means that in 2001 it was now in the top division of English Football, the Premier League. The club has been managed by Scott Parker since the 2020/21 season. == Name == * 1879-1888 - Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School * 1888-present - Fulham F.C. == Stadium == Fulham's stadium is called Craven Cottage. It was built 100 years ago. It has a pretty building in one corner of the pitch, this is the \"Cottage\". The fans of Fulham like to call it \"The Cottage\", and it can have 27,000 people sitting in it. From 2002 to 2004, Fulham had to play at Loftus Road, which is the ground of Queens Park Rangers, near the BBC headquarters. This was because the club needed to renovate Craven Cottage because of new rules. The rules said that nobody can stand at football games, so the club had to install new seats. Some people who live near to Craven Cottage do not like having a big club near to them. They made it hard for the club to be allowed to make the changes. This is why the changes took a long time, even though it was easy work for the builders. Because of the \"Cottage\", the club and its supporters are called \"The Cottagers\". == League position by season == Season League Position 2000/01 First Division 1st (Promoted) 2001/02 Premier League 13th 2002/03 Premier League 14th 2003/04 Premier League 9th 2004/05 Premier League 13th 2005/06 Premier League 12th 2006/07 Premier League 16th 2007/08 Premier League 17th 2008/09 Premier League 7th 2009/10 Premier League 12th 2010/11 Premier League 8th 2011-12 Premier League 9th 2012-13 Premier League 12th 2013-14 Premier League 19th (Relegated) 2014-15 Championship 17th 2015-16 Championship 20th 2016-17 Championship 6th 2017-18 Championship 3rd (Promoted) 2018-19 Premier League 19th (Relegated) === Former position === == Other websites == * Fulham Website * News about Fulham from the BBC (BBC) * Pictures of Craven Cottage * The outside of Craven Cottage Category:Premier League clubs Category:1879 establishments in England",
