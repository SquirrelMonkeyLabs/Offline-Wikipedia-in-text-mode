 "text": "Professional doctorate is the name given to an academic title. People who studied certain branches get a degree of Dr. at the end of their regular studies. This is mostly the case in branches such as medicine and law. This is not comparable to someone spending years writing and defending a thesis. It is more like a Master's degree, which people get after studying 4 to 5 years. Category:Academic degrees",
