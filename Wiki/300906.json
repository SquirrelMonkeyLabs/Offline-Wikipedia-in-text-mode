It was founded in 1887, still providing members with facilities. ==History== In 1887, a group of young men held a meeting at the County hotel in Derby and founded the Derby Sketching Club. They wanted to have a place where they and others could work, share their interest in painting and sketching. The fee for one year was two shillings and sixpence. Their first exhibition was held in January 1889, at the Athenaeum Rooms in Derby. In 1922, the Derby Ladies Art Group was formed. The two groups first held a joint Exhibition in 1951 for the Festival of Britain. They finally merged in 1966. The art collector Alfred E. Goodey. collected some of their work about Derby made by Sketching Club members. In the 1940s he presented the paintings to Derby Museum and Art Gallery. ==Current activities== There are regular sessions for members- for lifedrawing, and portrait painting and still life. There are guest lectures and exhibitions and members use the website to promote their work. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:Derby Category:1887 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1880s establishments in England",
