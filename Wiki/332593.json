 "text": "Mother's Day is a holiday that celebrates mothers and motherhood. The holiday was first made to celebrate a person's own mother. It was started in the United States in 1908 by Anna Jarvis. The holiday is celebrated at different times in different countries. In the United States, it is the second Sunday in May. Children make cards and a lot of other things for their mother. ==History== The idea for Mother's Day started in the 1850s. Ann Reeves Jarvis had mother's day work clubs where women tried to fight disease and bad milk. They also helped make hurt soldiers better during the Civil War. After the war, Ann made Mother's Day Friendship picnics and Mother's Friendship Day for the women from both sides of the war. In 1908 after her mother died, Anna Jarvis made the first Mother's Day celebration in Grafton, West Virginia. People also celebrated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and many other cities. For six years, Anna made the celebration bigger until President Woodrow Wilson made it a national holiday in 1914. ==References== * National Geographic Mother's Day history Category:May observances Category:1908 establishments in the United States",
