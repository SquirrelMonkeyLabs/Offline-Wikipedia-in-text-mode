 "text": "Ferguson's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus fergusonianus) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it between 300 and 700 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 32.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 36.7 â€“ 42.9 mm long. This frog has webbed skin on the back feet. The skin of the frog's head, sides, and back is brown with darker brown marks and white marks. Scientists used to think that Pseudophilautus hallidayi and Pseudophilautus fergusonianus were two different frogs, but now they think they are both the same frog and call them all Pseudophilautus fergusonianus. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
