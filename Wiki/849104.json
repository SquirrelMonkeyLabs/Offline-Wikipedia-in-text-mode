 "text": "Vietnamese Australians () are Australians who have ancestors who were originally Vietnamese, or people who went to Australia from Vietnam. Communities of overseas Vietnamese are referred to as Việt Kiều or người Việt hải ngoại. ==History in Australia== Up until 1975 there were fewer than 700 Vietnam-born people in Australia. After the takeover of South Vietnam by the North Vietnamese communist government in April 1975, Australia, being a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, agreed to resettle its share of Vietnam-born refugees under a plan to resettle refugees between 1975 and 1985. After the early intake of refugees in the late 1970s, there was a second immigration wave in 1983–84, most likely a result of the 1982 agreement between the Australian and Vietnamese governments (the Orderly Departure Program) which allowed relatives of Vietnamese Australians to leave Vietnam and move to Australia. A third immigration wave in the late 1980s seems to have been mainly due to Australia's family reunion scheme. ==References== ==Other websites== * Vietnamese Community in Australia * The Vietnamese in Australia * Gold & Silver: Vietnamese migration and relationships with environments in Vietnam and Sydney * Vietnamese Queenslanders.
