 "text": "Self-medicating is a contraversial practuice. It involves the use of drugs by a non-doctor to relieve unwanted symptoms the user has. It differs from recreational drug use in that the drug use is not for fun. Users that administer drugs in this way have usually been diagnosed or have substantial evidence that they have an illness. Self-medication drugs may be obtained by doctors, on-line or from illegal drug dealers. They may also be so desperate to relieve their symptoms, they might steal from the drug from friends, family and any other route they might find. Category:Pharmacy",
