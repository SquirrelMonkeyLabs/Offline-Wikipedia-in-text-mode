Newsmembers of the mary chain, April Skies (fansite) == History == === Early years === The Jesus and Mary Chain was based on the songwriting partnership of its two main members, Jim and William Reid, and bass guitar player Douglas Hart. The bands first career song, \"Upside Down\", was sold in October 1984 by Creation Records. The melody and lyrics (\"Inside I feel so bad/So low I feel so sad/Feels like I'm going mad/Best friend I've ever had.\") are similar to 1960s 'wall of sound' pop music such as music by Brill Building and Phil Spector, but \"Upside Down\" is more noisy with very simple drums and one guitar playing high pitched feedback during most of the song. The first drummer to play for the band was Murray Dalglish who was replaced by Bobby Gillespie (now a singer for Primal Scream). William Reid claimed that he had played the drums for the first song himself because of Dalglish's lack of ability. The single was given pleasing reviews by British music journalists, and the band was given fanatical support by the NME, it was their live shows that started most interest in The Jesus and Mary Chain. == Discography == === Studio albums === * Psychocandy (1985) * Darklands (1987) * Automatic (1989) * Honey's Dead (1992) * Stoned & Dethroned (1994) * Munki (1998) * Damage and Joy (2017) * Glasgow Eyes (2024) == References == == Other websites == * Official website (offline) * Official MySpace * Discography at Discogs.com * Category:British rock bands Category:South Lanarkshire",
