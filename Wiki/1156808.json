 "text": "The Mount Turumiquire rocket frog (Allobates mandelorum) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in cloud forests and places with woody plants smaller than trees. Scientists saw the frog between 1900 and 2630 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in many protected parks, for example Macizo de Turmiquire Protective Zone of Rivers. ==Young== Scientists think that the female frog lays her eggs on the ground and that, after the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. The biggest danger is changes to the places where the frog lives from fires and when people make farms, places for animals to eat grass, and roads. The chemicals that people put on farms can also hurt this frog. People take water from streams to put on farm plants. Some scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
