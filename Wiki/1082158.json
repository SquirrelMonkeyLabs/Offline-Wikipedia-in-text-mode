 "text": "Jonah Woodson Hex is a Western comic book antihero created by the late writer John Albano, and the late artist Tony DeZuniga and published by DC Comics. == Fictional character biography == Hex is a surly and cynical bounty hunter whose face is horribly scarred on the right side. Despite his poor reputation and personality, Hex is bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent. His marksmanship is nearly superhuman and he is likely the best marksman ever shown in DC comics long history. In his movie he had the ability to talk to the dead while touching their corpse but they are in extreme pain and desire for him to allow them to return to the afterlife. == In other media == The character was portrayed by Josh Brolin in a self-titled movie, Jim Cummings in the Jonah Hex Motion Comic and Johnathon Schaech in Legends of Tomorrow as well as voiced by Thomas Jane in DC Showcase: Jonah Hex.
