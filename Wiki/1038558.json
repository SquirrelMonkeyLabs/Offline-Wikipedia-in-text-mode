 "text": "Marina Bay, Singapore is a waterfront in Singapore's central region. The bay area was created by reclaiming the land around the body of water in front of Collyer Quay to form Marina Centre, Marina East, and Marina South. Marina Bay includes Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Bay Sands, Marina Bay Financial Centre, Asia Square, The Sail @ Marina Bay, and Marina One. As an important focus area for the Urban Development Authority of Singapore, Marina Bay has become Singapore's new downtown for the 21st century. == Early History == Marina Bay was once just a body of water where ships docked so passengers could transfer to smaller boats to be transported to Johnston's Pier (replaced. by Clifford Pier in 1933). Cargo ships too big to enter the Singapore River also stopped in the bay to unload their goods onto lighters (also known as bumboats) for transfer to the godowns along the river bank. == References == Category:Geography of Singapore Category:Tourism Category:Bays of Asia",
