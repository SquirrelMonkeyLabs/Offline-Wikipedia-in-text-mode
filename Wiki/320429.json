The family were defined as \"the most recent common ancestor of Zalmoxes robustus and Rhabdodon priscus and all the descendants of this common ancestor\". In 2005, Paul Sereno defined the family as \"the most inclusive clade containing Rhabdodon priscus but not Parasaurolophus walkeri\".Sereno P.C. 2005. \"Stem Archosauria Version 1.0.\" TaxonSearch.
