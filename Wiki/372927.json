 "text": "Guckkasten (Hangul: 국카스텐) is a South Korean Indie rock group that is known for psychedelic music. The members are Ha Hyun-woo (Hangul: 하현우, vocal), Jeon Kyu- ho (Hangul: 전규호), Lee Jung-gil (Hangul: 이정길) and Kim Ki-bum (Hangul: 김기범). The group formed in 2003 and their band was called \"The C.O.M\" at the time. In 2007, they renamed their band \"Guckkasten,\" a German word that means \"Chinese-style kaleidoscope\". The renaming of the band as \"Guckkasten\" was to reflect how their psychedelic music is like looking through a Chinese-style kaleidoscope with its beautiful and constantly changing pictures. This band tries to express their experimental mindset by playing music like psychedelic videos hidden under an analogous style. == Members == *Ha Hyun-woo (하현우) : vocals, guitar *Jeon Kyu-ho (전규호) : guitar *Lee Jung-gil (이정길) : drums *Kim Ki-bum (김기범) : bass guitar == History of Guckkasten == Lee Jung-gil and Ha Hyun-woo started a school band together. After quitting school, they moved to Seoul. Then they scouted Jeon Kyu-ho through the Internet and started a band \"New Unbalance\". In 2003, they realigned their members and created a band named \"The C.O.M\". However, \"The C.O.M\" broke up that year after the \"Ssamji sound festival\". Then in 2007, they formed the band again, but changed the name to \"Guckkasten,\" a German word for Chinese-style kaleidoscope. A year later, in 2008, Kim Ki-bum joined the band. Since then, they have performed as the band \"Guckkasten\" and never looked back. == Musical style and artistry == The music of Guckkasten can be classified as psychedelic. They try to express their music as psychedelic videos which is hidden under analogue.It is because their music is inspired by Hague's piece called Art and Fire.
