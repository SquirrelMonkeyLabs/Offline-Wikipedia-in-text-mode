 "text": "Bonnerichthys is an extinct, prehistoric pachycormiform in the family Pachycormidae from the Late Cretaceous of North America. It only has one species, B. gladius. Finds were made in the Smoky Hill Member of the Niobrara Formation of Kansas (Late Coniacian-Early Campanian), and additional material was later reported from the Pierre Shale, Mooreville Chalk, Demopolis Chalk, Wenonah Formation, and Moreno Formation. It was probably related to Rhinconichthys and Leedsichthys. == Features == One of the most significant features of Bonnerichthys is that it was a filter feeder, living on plankton. This recognition that many large-bodied fish from the Mesozoic in the Pachycormidae were filter feeders shows that this niche was filled for at least 100 million years. == References == # \"The Big Fish that Ate Small\" . 15 May 2014. == Other websites == * Bonnerichthys discussion at boneblogger.com * Media related to Bonnerichthys at Wikimedia Commons Category:Extinct fish Category:Ray-finned fish Category:Animals of North America Category:Cretaceous",
