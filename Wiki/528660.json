 "text": "Celibacy is the state of choosing to remain unmarried and/or abstain from sexual activity. This often done often for religious reasons. It is commonly associated with religious figures or followers who take vows to dedicate themselves to their faith. Some people choose celibacy as part of their spiritual practice or religious duties. In its narrow sense, celibacy refers to a vow or promise made for religious reasons to remain unmarried and abstain from sexual activity. In a broader sense, it simply means not engaging in sexual activity. Many religions have teachings about celibacy. For example, Hinduism encourages celibacy later in life, while Jainism requires complete celibacy for its monks. Buddhism also promotes celibacy, but views can vary based on cultural differences. In some African and Native American traditions, celibacy has been seen negatively, although there are exceptions like the Mesoamerican warriors who practiced temporary celibacy. In Ancient Rome, celibacy was considered unusual, and there were penalties for it, except for the Vestal Virgins, who took vows of chastity to serve the Roman state. In Christianity, celibacy is often a vow made by Catholic priests, monks, and nuns. Some Protestant and Anglican communities also practice celibacy. In contrast, Judaism and Islam generally encourage marriage and family life, although some Jewish and Islamic groups, such as the Essenes, practiced celibacy.Berachot 10a; Kiddushin 29b; Maimonides, Ishut 15:2; Shulchan Aruch, Even Hae'ezer 1:3 == References ==",
