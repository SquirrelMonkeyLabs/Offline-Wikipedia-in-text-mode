They came to the attention of the public after they said they were responsible for the attacks on Mumbai on 26 November 2008. It is possible that the organization could be related to the Indian Mujahideen. == Attacks on Mumbai == Indian authorities said that the Mumbai attacks were directed by Lashkar-e-Taiba militants inside Pakistan.Terror Ties Run Deep in Pakistan, Mumbai Case Shows, New York Times, Jane Perlez and Salman Masood, 26 July 2009 The surviving gunman was a Pakistani. Pakistan initially contested this attribution, but agreed this was the case on 7 January 2009.\"Gunman in Mumbai Siege a Pakistani\", New York Times, 7 January 2009 == Where the word is from == Deccan refers to the Deccan Plateau in southern India. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu lie on this plateau. The name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word dakkhin. That word comes from the Sanskrit word dakṣiṇa- (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.Monier-Williams Sanskrit- English Dictionary, p. 498 (scanned image at SriPedia Initiative): Sanskrit dakṣiṇa meaning 'right', 'southern'. Mujahideen (also spelt Mujahedin) in Arabic is a \"struggler\". So the name Deccan Muhahideen may literally mean Strugglers of the South, The South Strugglers or South Strugglers. ==Related pages== * 26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks * Terrorism == References == == Other websites == * Deccan Mujahideen on Mahalo.com Category:Islamic terrorism Category:Religion in India Category:Organizations based in India",
