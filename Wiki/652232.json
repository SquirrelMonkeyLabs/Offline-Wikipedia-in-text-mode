 "text": "On August 10, 2018, a Horizon Air Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 was stolen from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (\"Sea–Tac\") in SeaTac, Washington. The man responsible was 29-year-old Richard Russell. He was a Horizon Air ground service operator with no piloting experience. Russell performed an unauthorized takeoff and flew southward as F-15 fighter jets were scrambled to take down the plane. Sea–Tac air traffic control made radio contact with Russell. He was killed when the plane crashed on sparsely populated Ketron Island in Puget Sound. ==References== Category:2018 crimes in the United States Category:2010s in Washington (state) Category:August 2018 events",
