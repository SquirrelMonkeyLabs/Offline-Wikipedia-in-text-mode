The magazine focused on games, consoles, news, and other topics related to Nintendo. The magazine first started as Nintendo Magazine System and was published by EMAP. Throughout its lifespan, the magazine would also change its name to Nintendo Magazine, Nintendo Official Magazine (NOM), and Nintendo Official Magazine UK. On 15 December 2008 the magazine would launch in Australia and New Zealand under the name Official Nintendo Magazine for Australia & New Zealand. It was the first time that magazine officially endorsed by Nintendo was released in Australia since Nintendo Magazine System went out of business in 2000. In 2013, the magazine celebrated its 100th edition with cover art of Mario and a Pikmin drawn from band by Shigeru Miyamoto. The last issue was in October 2014, with the main feature being a spotlight on the 2014 game Hyrule Warriors. The magazine's website and social media were shut down on 11 November. ==References== Category:2008 establishments in Australia Category:2006 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2014 disestablishments Category:Australian culture Category:Magazines of the United Kingdom Category:Monthly magazines Category:Nintendo Category:Video game magazines",
