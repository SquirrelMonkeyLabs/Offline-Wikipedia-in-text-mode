 "text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of businessman Andrew Yang began when he announced his candidacy one day before the 2017 elections, on November 6, 2017. People thought Yang had no chance of winning, because his campaign was so unusual. Yang was the first Asian-American man to run for president as a Democrat. If he was elected, he would have become the first Asian-American to become president. He would have also been the third-youngest president on inauguration day at age 46 after Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Yang wanted a universal basic income of $1000 per month for all adult citizens to make up for the lowering number of low-wage jobs due to automation. On February 11, 2020, Yang announced that he would end his campaign after losing the New Hampshire primaries. ==References== Yang",
