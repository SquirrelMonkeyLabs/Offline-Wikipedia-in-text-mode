The Emir of Amid and Hisni Keyfa, Melik Masud, and the Emir of Mardin, Melik el Mansur, wanted to support Jalaluddin against the Seljuk Sultan of Anatolia and the Ayyubid kings of Egypt and Syria. Meanwhile, Celaleddin Khwarazmshah ignored Alaaddin Keykubad's warnings and continued the siege of Ahlat. The walls were battered with the catapults that were set up and the siege continued. Although the people of Ahlat did not like Taqi al-Din Abbas and Mujiruddin Yaqub, the brothers of Malik Ashraf, they were forced to help them simply because they were afraid of Khwarazmshah. The intermediaries who came from Baghdad, Syria and Anatolia and tried to lift the siege could not achieve their goal. After a long siege, Jalaluddin Khwarazmshah finally attacked the city with a massive assault on Sunday, April 14, 1230, and captured it by force of the sword.https://isamveri.org/pdfdrg/D02042/2012_2/2012_2_BOZANO.pdf The Amid, Hasankeyf and Mardin Artuk people also informed him of his obediation.Cuveyni, , p. 368; Howorth, p. 17-19. ===Second Conflict=== Another group fled to the Balqa' and were hired by al-Nasir Da'ud. The sultan promptly sent an army under Fakhr al-Din ibn al-Shaykh against al-Nasir Da'ud. On 1 September 1246, al-Nasir Da'ud and his Khwarazmians were defeated at al-Salt. The survivors retired to Kerak, where they were besieged. The siege was lifted after al-Nasir agreed to hand over the Khwarazmians to Fakhr al-Din, who enrolled them in his own army. They ended up in Egypt. Still another group of Khwarazmians under Kushlu-Khan joined with the Mongols in Mesopotamia. ==References== Category:13th-century conflicts Category:Wars involving Asia",
