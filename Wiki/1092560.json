 "text": "The MAT-49 is a submachine gun of French origin used by the French army from the 1950s to the 1980s, and manufactured by Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Tulle (MAT). It was used in the Indochina and Vietnam wars. It was a compact weapon that had a retractable wire stock; in addition, its magazine could be folded parallel to the barrel (which facilitated its use by paratroopers and tankers). In 9mm caliber, it had a magazine with capacity for 32 cartridges, a rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute and fired with the bolt open. A version with a fixed wooden stock and longer barrel was also produced. Category:Submachine guns",
