 "text": "An anti-war movement (also antiwar) is a social movement, usually against to a nation's decision to start or continue a war. It does not matter whether the nation has a just cause for war. The term can also refer to pacifism, which is the opposition to all use of military force during conflicts. Many activists distinguish between anti-war movements and peace movements. Anti-war activists work through protest and other peaceful means to attempt to pressure a government (or governments) to put an end to a particular war or conflict. ==Related pages== *Antiwar.com *Conscientious objector *Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War *Nuclear disarmament *Pacifism *Protests against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ==Other websites== *Guide to anti-war websites by The Guardian *Essays and speeches from the Antebellum Era peace movement Category:Activism Category:War Category:Peace",
