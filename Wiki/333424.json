 "text": "The state of California has 58 counties. Counties are responsible for all elections, property-tax collection, maintenance of public records such as deeds, and local-level courts within their borders, as well as providing law enforcement (through the county sheriff and sheriff's deputies) to areas that are not in cities. California's United States Postal Service code is CA and its FIPS code is 06. == List == |} == Old counties == *Klamath County was formed in 1851 from the northern half of Trinity County. Part of the county's territory went to Del Norte County in 1857, and in 1874 the rest was split between Humboldt and Siskiyou counties. *Pautah County was formed in 1852 out of land which, the state of California thought, was to be given to it by the United States Congress from land in what is now the state of Nevada. In 1859 when the cession never occurred, the California State Legislature did not make the county. ==Notes== * California Category:California-related lists",
