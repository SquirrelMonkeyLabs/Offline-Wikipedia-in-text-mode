 "text": "Mecabricks is an online tool to build, render, and animate Lego in a browser using Three.js. In 2012, Nicolas Jarraud (online alias \"scrubs\")(Article) on rendering quality improvement and products of Nicolas Jarraud released the first version of Mecabricks. There have been updates with new features such as a tool to animate or the mosaic tool. Mecabricks is popular for its ability to export models directly to Blender for realistic rendering and its large library of models. Some tools the workshop has are:Brickset Article, Let's build in Mecabricks * The mosaic tool will create pixel art from any image * Flex tool to manipulate flexible objects such as string * The snap tool can snap any parts into place * Grouping parts together * Toggling the visibility * Selecting by color and/or piece type * Box & multi-select to select large amounts of parts at once * Duplicating parts The color of the pieces can be changed using a color palette that corresponds to the official Lego colors. If you click in the \" legacy\" button you can have more colors. The workshop can export and import these file formats: Import Name File extension Lego Digital Designer .lxf, .lxfml LDraw .ldr, .mpd, .io Export Name File extension Export options Blender add-on .zmbx - Collada .dae Logo on studs, Instances, Normals Wavefront .obj Logo on studs Stl .stl Logo on studs == Rendering == The Mecabricks render farm was custom-built by Scrubs and allows rendering models in the browser by sending the model to the render farm.BrickSet Article, The Render Farm After rendering is complete, the image is sent to Mecabricks where it can be downloaded. The render farm can be used for free, but users are only allowed 10 free renders a day under 0.7 million pixels. With rendering comes a few objects that can be of help, such as lamps, cameras, and the volumetric box. Multiple frames can be rendered for rendering animations and other features such as scratches, fingerprints, and dents can make the render(s) look even more realistic. == Animating == Animation can be done in nodes, which is a separate area from the workshop view that can be toggled on or off. Different node trees are executed when the animation plays. The node trees themselves contain nodes that can determine a piece's position, material (color), and visibility over a timespan. It is also possible to instance large amounts of pieces. Other settings such as frame rate and animation length can also be determined in nodes. == Prints == Textures can be added to parts, which can be uploaded to free storage for these prints. These prints are then available and can be exported to Blender using the Blender addon. Other people can then save this print as their own if the model is public and open to workshop. == References == == Other websites == * bricklink.com Category:Entertainment websites Category:Lego",
