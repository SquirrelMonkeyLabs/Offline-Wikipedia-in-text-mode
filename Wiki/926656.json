 "text": "An all-you-can-eat restaurant (AYCE) is a restaurant where any amount of food can be eaten for one price. They are often buffets. == Buffets == Herbert \"Herb\" Cobb McDonald, a Las Vegas publicity and entertainment manager, introduced the idea in 1946. William Pearson talked about buffets in his 1965 novel The Muses of Ruin: A 2011 study showed more food is eaten if buffets cost more. COVID-19 restrictions from March 2020 briefly closed many all-you- can-eat places. == Other restaurants == Korean barbecue, Brazilian churrasco and Chinese hot pot are often all-you-can-eat. == Drinks == Unlimited drinks, mostly alcoholic drinks, are \"all-you-can-drink\" or \"bottomless\", as in \"bottomless brunch\" or \"bottomless mimosas\". == References == Category:Restaurants",
