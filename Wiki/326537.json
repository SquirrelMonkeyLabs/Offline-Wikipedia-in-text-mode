 "text": "Comiskey Park was a baseball park in Armour Square, Chicago, Illinois. For more than 80 years, it was the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Chicago White Sox. It was opened in the middle of the 1910 baseball season, and closed after the end of the 1990 season. It was replaced by the park now known as Guaranteed Rate Field, which was built across the street to the south of Comiskey Park. The old ballpark was made of steel, concrete and bricks. It was fully destroyed in summer 1991. == Sources == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
