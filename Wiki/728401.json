 "text": "Fallout 76 is a video game in the Fallout series released in 2018. It was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. Although it came out after Fallout 4, Fallout 76 is not a sequel. It takes place earlier than all of the other Fallout games, more like a prequel. Fallout 76 was made using the Creation Engine, just like Fallout 4. It is also the first Fallout game made by Bethesda Game Studios that includes multiplayer. It needs an Internet connection to play, because it is all online. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2018 video games Category:Fallout Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Open-world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video game prequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
