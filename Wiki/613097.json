He then opened his first restaurant on Via Bonvesin de la Riva in Milan. Within a year he earned his first Michelin star, with another following the next year. It took another seven years, but then he eventually won the distinction of a third Michelin star – the first chef in Italy to do so. In 2011, Marchesi became the first celebrity chef to design two hamburgers and a dessert for McDonald's. In May 2017, Marchesi and Director Maurizio Gigola presented the Documentary \"Marchesi: The Great Italian\" at the Cannes Film Festival. Marchesi died in Rome on 26 December 2017 of cardiac arrest at the age of 87.Gualtiero Marchesi, è morto il grande maestro della cucina italiana ==References== ==Other websites== * * ALMA - Scuola di Cucina Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from cardiac arrest Category:Italian chefs Category:People from Milan",
