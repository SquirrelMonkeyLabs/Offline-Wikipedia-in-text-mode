 "text": "Gloss is how shiny or reflective a surface is, like a mirror. It shows how well a surface bounces back light in one clear direction. Gloss is important because it helps describe how an object looks. How light reflects or spreads in different ways is called \"cesia.\" Cesia includes gloss and other ways light behaves, using three main ideas to explain it. Gloss is affected by the materialâ€™s ability to bend light (called the refractive index), the angle where light hits the surface and how smooth or rough the surface is. Gloss depends on specular reflection (Light bouncing off in the same direction, like a mirror) and diffuse reflection (Light scattering in many directions). == Sources == * * Category:Optics Category:Physical properties",
