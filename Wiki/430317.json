 "text": "Elmet () was an independent Brittonic kingdom. It occupied the area of what was later the West Riding of Yorkshire. Elmet appears in records during the Early Middle Ages between the 5th century and early 7th century. Its neighbor to the east was the Anglian kingdom of Deira. The Anglian kingdom of Mercia was to the south. To the west it bordered on the Irish Sea. Elmet was the last surviving British kingdom in the early Anglo-Saxon period. ==History== Elmet emerged from Roman Britain as a British kingdom. The Elmetsæte (people of Elmet) were listed in Tribal Hidage as 600 hides.Christopher A. Snyder, The Britons (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), p. 209 Elmet may have originally been a subkingdom of the Brigantes. Ceredig, the last king of Elmet, was defeated in 617 by Edwin of Deira around Leeds in the south Pennines.Mike Ashley, The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens (New york: Carroll & Graf, 1999), p. 107 Edwin expelled Ceredig from Elmet and from that time on Elmet was a part of Northumbria. The kings of Elmet had a royal residence at Campodonum (possibly near Doncaster) and another at Loidis (Leeds).Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People, trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 132 The Elmetsæte were apparently Christian, at least by the time they were conquered by Northumbria. Bede wrote of an abbot named Thrydwulf and his monastery in Elmet wood. ===Kings of Elmet=== * Mascuid Gloff (born c.440) - May have been the first king.
