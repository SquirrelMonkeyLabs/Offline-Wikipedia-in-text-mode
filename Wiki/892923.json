The zone includes the U.S. territory of American Samoa, as well as the Midway Islands and the uninhabited islands of Jarvis, Palmyra, and Kingman Reef. It also includes the country of Niue. The zone is one hour behind Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone and one hour ahead of the Howland and Baker islands, and 23 hours behind Wake Island Time Zone. The nation of Samoa also used the same time as the Samoa Time Zone until it moved across the International Date Line at the end of 29 December 2011; it is now 24 hours (25 hours in southern hemisphere summer) in front of American Samoa. == Populated areas == *Pago Pago, American Samoa ==Related pages== *Time zone *Time offset *Chamorro Time Zone *Wake Island Time Zone *Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone *Central Time Zone *Eastern Time Zone *Atlantic Time Zone *Newfoundland Time Zone == References == Category:Time zones Category:American Samoa",
