On 14 August 2013, a localized Thai feed was launched on TrueVisions, using the logo and branding developed by Mainframe for Boomerang UK and other European countries. Boomerang Thailand retained the EMEA branding until 15 March 2024, when it rebranded with the 2015 logo and 2018 branding seen throughout the world. As of April 2025, Thailand is the only Asian country with Boomerang. ==References== Category:Television channels in Asia",
