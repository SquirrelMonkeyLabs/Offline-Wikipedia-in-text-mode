 "text": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that starts from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. Many are benign, while some are malignant. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are often called carcinoid tumors, but they are also found in the pancreas, lung and the rest of the body. Many tests can be used to diagnose neuroendocrine tumours, including blood tests, urine tests, scans and a biopsy (where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination). ==References== ==Other websites== * The Neuroendocrine Cancer Awareness Network (NCAN) Category:Cancer",
