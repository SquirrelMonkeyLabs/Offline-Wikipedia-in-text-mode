 "text": "Silicones () are polymers that include any inert, synthetic compound made up of repeating units of siloxane. This is a functional group of two silicon atoms and one oxygen atom frequently combined with carbon and/ or hydrogen. They are typically heat-resistant and rubber-like. Silicones are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, and thermal and electrical insulation. Some common forms include silicone oil, silicone grease, silicone rubber, silicone resin, and silicone caulk.Hans-Heinrich Moretto, Manfred Schulze, Gebhard Wagner (2005) \"Silicones\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Silicone is also used for cosmetics. Silicones are compounds containing the element silicon (), but have very different properties from the pure element.James L.
