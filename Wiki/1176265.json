 "text": "Awful Records is an Atlanta-based independent record label and collective, founded in 2011, known for its experimental and eclectic sound, and artists like Father, Playboi Carti, and Keith Ape. Besides Father, Playboi Carti, and Keith Ape, other artists associated with Awful Records include Abra, Tommy Genesis, ilovemakonnen, Danger Incorporated, and Faye Webster. == History of Awful Records == Awful Records began as a group of \"weirdos\" who liked to party and make art, evolving into a collective of artists pushing creative boundaries. The label's artists explore a wide range of styles, from woozy psychedelic trap and synthy romantic R&B; to trunk-rattling Southern bounce. In 2018, Awful Records partnered with RCA Records, allowing Awful to sign artists to a joint contract. Father's major label debut, \"Awful Swim,\" was released in conjunction with RCA and Adult Swim. However, the partnership ended in 2020, with Awful focusing on releasing Father's material and serving as a clothing brand. Awful Records has returned to its roots as a collective, with a focus on releasing new Father material and serving as a clothing brand. Their website is [awfulrecords.com] and Awful Records has a presence on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) [@AWFULRECORDS], Facebook, and Instagram. Awful Records also sells merchandise, including clothing items like t-shirts and hoodies.",
