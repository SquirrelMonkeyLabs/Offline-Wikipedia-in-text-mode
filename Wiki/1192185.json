 "text": "Tokiltoeton was a Nubian king in the kingdom of Nobatia who ruled in the 6th century. Tokiltoeton is known primarily from a foundation inscription from the fortified settlement of Ikhmindi in Lower Nubia, which speaks of the foundation of a \"building.\" The inscription can be dated to the second half of the 6th century. Interpretation of the inscription shows that the \"building\" referred to the defensive structure of the city to be founded. == Literature == * Friedrich Wilhelm Deichmann, Peter Grossmann: Nubian Research.
