 "text": "The Israel–Hamas war has caused a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. This crisis involves many different problems, including famine and the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system. UNICEF and well-known nonprofit organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross have warned that the crisis in Gaza is severe. On November 8, 2023, the United Nations Human Rights chief described a border into Gaza as \"gates to a living nightmare.\" == Blockade == See the main article: Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2023) Israel began blockading Gaza at the beginning of the war. This prevented anything from going in or out, leaving the local people without enough fuel, food, or medical supplies. By October 2023, the blockade had caused electricity to drop by 90%; this affected hospitals, sewage plants, and water sources. There have been widespread disease outbreaks across Gaza. == Airstrikes == Israeli airstrikes caused extensive damage to Gaza, which worsened the humanitarian crisis. CNN estimated in December 2023 that Israel had dropped over five hundred 2,000-pound bombs on Gaza in the first month of the war. Marc Garlasco, a former defense intelligence analyst and war crimes investigator, told CNN: > [These] heavy munitions, mostly manufactured by the US, can cause high > casualty events and can have a lethal fragmentation radius – an area of > exposure to injury or death around the target – of up to 365 meters (about > 1,198 feet), or the equivalent of 58 soccer fields in area. Over 4,000 children died or were hurt in the first month of the war. In November 2023, the United Nations Secretary-General said Gaza was \"becoming a graveyard for children. As of January 2024, Israel’s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70–80% of all buildings in northern part of Gaza. ==References== Category:History of the Gaza Strip Category:2024 in Asia Category:Israel–Hamas war",
