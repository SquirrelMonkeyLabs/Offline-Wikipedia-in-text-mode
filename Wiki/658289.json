 "text": "The Mississippi Delta, also known as the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, is the distinctive northwest section of the U.S. state of Mississippi (and small portions of Arkansas and Louisiana) which lies between the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers. The region has been called \"The Most Southern Place on Earth\",James C. Cobb, The Most Southern Place on Earth: The Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity (1992) because of its racial, cultural, and economic history. It is 200 miles long and 87 miles across about 4,415,000 acres, or, some 7,000 square miles of floodplain. It was developed as one of the richest cotton-growing areas in the nation before the American Civil War (1861â€“1865). It had many cotton plantations worked by black slaves. After the war many became sharecroppers. ==References== Category:Regions of the United States Category:Geography of Mississippi",
