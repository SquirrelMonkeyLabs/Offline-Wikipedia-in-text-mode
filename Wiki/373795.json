 "text": "Argleton was a place name of a village that did not exist. It was a phantom settlement that was shown on Google Maps. It was located in the parish of Aughton, Lancashire. An employee of Edge Hill University noticed this in 2008, and could show that at the location, there are only empty fields. Some people have suggested that Google added a fake village to Google Maps on purpose to catch out other people in case they plagiarised their work. However, other people have suggested that Google Maps just made a mistake. Argleton had been removed from Google Maps by May 2010. == References == Category:Internet memes Category:Lancashire Category:Google Category:Fictional locations",
