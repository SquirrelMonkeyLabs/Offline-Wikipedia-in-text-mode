He graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1909. Then he went to Oxford University. He was teaching at Vanderbilt around 1915 when a group of students began talking about Ameican life and the writing of that time. This group of young poets, like Robert Penn Warren, Allen Tate, and others, started a magazine called The Fugitive. This began a new movement in Southern writing. Ransom wrote poetry before 1927. After that, he wrote essays and books about the art of literature. His ideas were about the value of tradition. In 1937 he started teaching at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. He started a literary magazine, The Kenyon Review. In 1941 he published essays about literature in his book The New Criticism. Many important poets were printed in The Kenyon Review.
