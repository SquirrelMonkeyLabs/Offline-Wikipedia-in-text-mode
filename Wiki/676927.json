 "text": "The Dutch rabbit, also known as Hollander or Brabander, simply Tuxedo rabbit are little rabbits with distinctive white-blazed faces and two-toned bodies. They are small and compact, making them easy to handle even for children. Dutch have short, glossy fur. They come in these colors: black, blue, chocolate, gray, steel, and tortoise. They grow to be 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 pounds. The Dutch rabbit breed originated in the Netherlands. Very early in their development the rabbits with Dutch markings were called Petite Brabicons. When they came to England they were called Hollanders. Later they came to be known as Dutch. Dutch are generally friendly, gentle, and hardy. Because of their small size and social temperament, they are an excellent choice for children. Dutch are commonly used for showing, and make challenging show rabbits because of their unique markings.
