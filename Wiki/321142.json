The racial makeup of the town was 89.45% White, 1.27% African American, 0.36% Native American, 0.54% Asian, 1.47% from other races, and 6.92% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.16% of the population. == History == The town was founded in the 1680s as Peagscomsuck until 1703. In 1832, Prudence Crandall, a school teacher, opened the first school for African American girls. The \"Black Law\" did not allow the education of black people. However, Crandall taught until she was sent to prison in 1832 for a short time. Angry mobs forced the school to close in 1834. Crandall later married and moved out of the state. Connecticut ended the \"Black Law\" in 1838. They also gave Crandall a small pension in 1886, four years before her death. The school is now the Prudence Crandall Museum. == References == Category:Towns in Connecticut Category:1680s establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:17th-century establishments in Connecticut",
