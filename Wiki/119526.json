 "text": "These are lists of active and all-time NHL team post-season, post-season series win, Stanley Cup Final and Stanley Cup droughts up to and including the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Those teams which have never made it in team history are listed by the season that they entered the league, either as a new team or when they merged into the NHL from the WHA. These lists do not include the canceled 2004–05 NHL season. ==Longest active droughts== ===Post-season appearance droughts=== A post-season appearance drought is continued by not making the NHL playoffs after the regular season. Since the first round of the playoffs consists of 8 series (16 teams) and there are 32 teams in the NHL, there will always be 16 teams that did not make the most recent playoffs on this list. The other 16 teams – the Boston Bruins, Carolina Hurricanes, Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, Edmonton Oilers, Florida Panthers, Los Angeles Kings, Nashville Predators, New York Islanders, New York Rangers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, Vegas Golden Knights, Washington Capitals, and Winnipeg Jets – all qualified for the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs.

Since the first round of the NHL playoffs consist of 8 series (16 teams), there will always be 23 teams in this list – the 15 teams that do not qualify for the post-season, plus the 8 teams that lose their first round series. The other 8 teams – the Boston Bruins, Carolina Hurricanes, Colorado Avalanche, Columbus Blue Jackets, Dallas Stars, New York Islanders, San Jose Sharks and St. Louis Blues – all won a post-season series in the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs.
