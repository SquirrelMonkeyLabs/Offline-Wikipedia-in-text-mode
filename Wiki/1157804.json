 "text": "Kaisa or karoliina is a cue sport mainly played in Finland. The game comes from Russia, where it is still played. Kaisa equipment is similar to Russian pyramid. It has small pockets barely large enough for a ball to enter. Kaisa tables are usually 10 feet long. It is a two-player or two-team game. As with many carom billiards games, both players have their own used to shoot at the other balls. One is usually differentiated by one cue ball having a dot or other marking on it. In all, five balls are used: the yellow (called the kaisa in Finnish), two red object balls, and the two white cue balls (each of which serves as an object ball for the opponent). The game is played to 60 . ==Origins== Kaisa can be traced back to an 18th century game called Russian carambole played with two white cue balls and one red object ball. By the beginning of the 19th century, a new variant added two more object balls: a blue ball and a black, brown, or yellow ball called the karolin, caroline, or carline which gave the game its name. == References == == Other websites == * Carline or Caroline 1866 rules for Russian game Category:Pool (cue sports)",
