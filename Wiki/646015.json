With this decision gone, regulating abortion is now up to the states. ==References== ==Other websites== * * by the Notre Dame Law School * Law schools play prominently in Trump's judicial nominations, law.com; accessed May 2, 2018. * Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees for the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from New Orleans Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Politicians from Washington, D.C.
