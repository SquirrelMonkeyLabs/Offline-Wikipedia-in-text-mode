Ferrovia played with only 10 players. The game was abandoned after a dispute over the last goal in the 117th minute. Scorer for Westmark unknown. Bye:White Star ==Round of 32== First round with teams from the highest league Gersthofer SV waived the drawn home advantage. Rapid Oberlaa waived the drawn home advantage. SC Nicholson waived the drawn home advantage. The goal to 4:1 was disputed, the shooter not ascertainable, but it was considered an own goal by the goalkeeper Eichinger. After acknowledging the hit, he left angrily the pitch and Raab went into the Cricketer's goal. As shortly after Eichinger wanted to get back into the game, the referee didn't let him in. Viktoria XXI waived the drawn home advantage. WAF waived the drawn home advantage. *Replay match: *Bye: Wiener Rasensportfreunde ==Round of 16== ==Quarter finals== Stadium selection by agreement of both clubs, in case of dispute association decision. ==Semi- finals== Neutral venue ==Final== *SK Admira Wien: Friedrich Franzl - Edmund Stern - Anton Janda - Johann Klima - Anton Koch - Karl Schott - Ignaz Siegl - Franz Runge - Karl Stoiber - Anton Schall - Karl Klima coaches:Hans Kozourek/Johann Skolaut *Wiener AC: Rudolf Hiden - Johann Becher - Julius Pfau - Walter Nausch - Anton Bilek - Georg Braun - Viktor Hierländer - Heinrich Müller - Johann Walzhofer - Josef Weiss - Karl Huber coaches: Max Seemann/Hans Neumann/Jenö Konrad ==References== Category:Austrian Cup Category:1928 in sports Category:1920s in Austria Category:1927 in sports Category:1927 in Europe",
