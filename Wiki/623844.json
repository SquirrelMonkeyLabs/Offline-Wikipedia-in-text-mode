In Chinese, the flag is commonly described as Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth(青天白日滿地紅) to reflect its property. The flag was first used in mainland China as the Navy flag in 1912, and was made the official national flag of the Republic of China (ROC) in 1928 by the Kuomintang (KMT). The flag is no longer used in mainland China after the People's Republic of China was made in 1949. ==References== China, Republic of Category:Taiwan",
