 "text": "Flea (Michael Peter Balzary) is an Australian-American bassist. He was born on October 16, 1962, in the city of Melbourne, Australia. He plays in the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. He has been with the band since its beginning in 1983 along with vocalist Anthony Kiedis. He is also known onstage for wearing weird costumes that largely appeal to the audience. Flea is known for his unique bass style. He uses a wide range of bass guitar techniques, mainly popping and slapping and changing the speed of his tempo during songs and his quick improvisation. Flea is also a skilled trumpet player. Flea was responsible for getting John Frusciante back into Red Hot Chili Peppers. In September 2009, it was announced that Flea would be playing with Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke, to perform some of Yorke's material. Flea is generally regarded by the public as the greatest rock bassist of all time, among similar artists such as Les Claypool and Victor Wooten. == References == Category:20th-century American musicians Category:21st-century American musicians Category:1962 births Category:American bass guitarists Category:American punk musicians Category:American rock guitarists Category:Australian guitarists Category:Australian rock musicians Category:Bassists Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:Musicians from Melbourne Category:Musicians from New York (state) Category:Red Hot Chili Peppers members Category:Warner Bros.
