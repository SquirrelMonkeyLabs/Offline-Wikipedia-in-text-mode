 "text": "Super Mario All-Stars (titled Super Mario Collection in Japan) is a video game made by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and released in 1993. It is a remake of four previous Super Mario games in one cartridge. The four games are Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. The Lost Levels was originally called Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan and was the original sequel to Super Mario Bros.. It was later re-released in 1994 with Super Mario World as Super Mario All- Stars + Super Mario World. ==Gameplay== Super Mario All-Stars features mostly- identical ports of the games included, albeit with new graphics and improved sound. Some games have minor changes however, such as The Lost Levels bonus levels being unlocked by rescuing Princess Toadstool once instead of eight times like the original, and 2 having a whirl effect when the player travels down a Warp Zone. In addition, the Super Mario Bros. remake has a bug in which Mario does not go straight down when destroying a Brick Block. ==Re-release== In 2010, Nintendo released Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition for the Wii in celebration of the Mario series' 25th anniversary. It includes a port of Super Mario All-Stars as well as a Mario history book and a CD containing music from the series. It was released on October 21, 2010 in Japan, on December 3, 2010 in Europe, and on December 12, 2010 in North America. ==References== Category:Mario platform games Category:1993 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Video game compilations Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii games",
