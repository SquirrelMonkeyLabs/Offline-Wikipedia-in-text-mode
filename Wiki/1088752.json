 "text": "The Harrisson's flying frog or brown tree frog (Leptomantis harrissoni) is a frog. It lives in the Indonesia and Malaysia. People have seen it between 0 and 350 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. This frog does not live in places that human beings have changed. This frog lays eggs in holes and trees. The male finds a hole and calls to the female. The trees must be very tall or else the frog will not go there. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. This frog can be in some danger from human beings cutting down the forests. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
