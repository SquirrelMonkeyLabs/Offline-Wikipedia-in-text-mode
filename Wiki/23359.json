He was re-elected as Governing Mayor in 2006, and has carried on the coalition. He supports Kurt Beck as \"Kanzlerkandidat\", the SPDs nominee for the Chancellorship of Germany.

He came out at a convention of the Berlin SPD just before the 2001 mayoral elections, when he said \"\" (\"I am gay, and it's good that way\".) This is now a famous quotation in Germany. He probably came out so that the tabloid newspapers could not publish what they thought were embarrassing stories about him. Wowereit is not the only gay mayor of a large European city. Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, is openly gay, and Ole von Beust, the former mayor of Hamburg, is also gay.While Beust's father has confirmed his son's homosexuality in an interview, Beust himself considers his sexual orientation a private matter and when asked directly usually ironically refers the questioner to his father.
