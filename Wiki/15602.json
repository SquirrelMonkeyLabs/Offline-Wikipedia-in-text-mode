 "text": "The Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and 39 other countries, led by the United States. It started with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on August 2, 1990. Iraq had claimed Kuwait as part of its territory. Iraq is said to have suffered around 80,000-100,000 soldier losses. There were two military operations. Operation Desert Shield brought troops to protect Dhahran, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states that Iraq had not attacked. Operation Desert Storm attacked Iraq's forces both in Kuwait and in Iraq. It started on 17 January, 1991 with an air strike. Ground operations started 24 February. Iraqi forces set fire to oil wells to slow the attack. The war ended on 28 February, 1991 with a ceasefire. The long Iranâ€“Iraq War had ended in August 1988. Iraq owed a great amount of money to Saudi Arabia and had difficulty paying it back. Saddam Hussein declared the neighboring country of Kuwait to be siphoning Iraqi crude oil from across the border, and on August 2nd, 1990 the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait started. On January 17, 1991 the US began the Persian Gulf War with a massive US led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm. The attacks were assisted by newly developed weapons, including stealth aircraft, cruise missiles and smart bombs. After 42 days of fighting U.S. President Bush declared a ceasefire on February 28. By that time most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled. Operation Desert storm included a bombing campaign that targeted Iraqi aircraft, anti-aircraft systems, oil refineries, weapon factories, bridges, and roads. President George Bush decided not to depose Saddam Hussein. Political issues after Operation Desert Storm lead to the second Persian Gulf War in 2003. ==Related pages== * Iran-Iraq War * 2003 invasion of Iraq ==References== Category:1990 in Asia Category:1991 in Asia Category:Cold War Category:1990s in Kuwait Category:Wars involving Australia Category:Wars involving Belgium Category:Wars involving Canada Category:Wars involving Egypt Category:Wars involving France Category:Wars involving Iraq Category:Wars involving Italy Category:Wars involving the Netherlands Category:Wars involving New Zealand Category:Wars involving Pakistan Category:Wars involving Spain Category:Wars involving Syria Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom Category:Wars involving the United States Category:1990 in the United States Category:1991 in the United States Category:Conflicts in 1990",
