 "text": "German athletes have been a part of most of the Olympic Games since the first modern Games in 1896. The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Germany is GER. \"Official abbreviations\" at The Games of the XVIII Olympiad, Tokyo, 1964, [p. 9 of 409 PDF]; retrieved 2012-10-12. ==History== Germany has hosted three Olympic Games. They hosted both the Winter and Summer Games in 1936. They also hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics. Germany was also to be the host of the 1916 Summer Olympics and the 1940 Winter Olympics. Neither of these were held because of World War I and World War II. After these wars, Germans were not allowed to be a part of the Olympics in 1920, 1924 and 1948. From after World War II until 1990, the country was divided and took part in the Olympics separately. Each of the two German states boycotted the Summer Games. West Germany was one of 65 countries that did not go to Moscow in 1980. This boycott was because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles. German athletes have won 1618 medals. . They have won 528 gold, 542 silver and 548 bronze medals. == German post-WW2 division until 1990== German organisations were ended by the Allies in 194. In 1950 the IOC accepted the Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland for all of Germany. It was in (West) Germany. Due to the Cold War, the (German Democratic Republic) was created in October 1949. A National Olympic Committee (NOC) for East Germany was created in 1951. It was not accepted by the IOC at first. Until 1965, athletes of the NOC of East Germany had to join the German team represented by the NOC of (West) Germany. This team took part in the Olympics from 1956 to 1964. It is now called the United Team of Germany (EUA, \"Equipe Unifiée Allemande\"), but was Germany (GER) then. Because of Germany being divided, from 1968 to 1990 two teams took part in each of the Games. Their designations were GER for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and GDR for the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1980 the West German code was changed to FRG. After the East Germany became a part of Germany again in 1990, Germany had a single team. It was designated GER. In the early 1950s the French-controlled Saar had its own NOC. It took part in the 1952 Summer Olympics. It became a part of the German Olympic team in 1956. ==Medals== Team (IOC code) № Summer Gold Silver Bronze Total № Winter Gold Silver Bronze Total № Games Gold Silver Bronze Combined Total (GER) Competed 1896–1952 and 1992–current.
