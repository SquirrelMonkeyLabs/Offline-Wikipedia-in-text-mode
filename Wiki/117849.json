 "text": "Zira () was one of the two tehsils of Punjab that was part of a controversy during the Partition of India. The other tehsil was Ferozpur. Sir Cyril Radcliffe created the boundary between India and Pakistan just days before the partition. A draft of the award was supposedly sent to Evan Jenkins by George Abell, Lord Mountbattenâ€™s private secretary. Jenkings was the provincial governor of Punjab at the time. The draft had the description of the Punjab boundary. It showed that the tehdils of Ferozepur and Zira tehsils were to be a part of Pakistan. The final version of the boundary gave the areas to India. This caused Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, to say that the award was not just, incomprehensible and perverse. He did agreed to accept the action. The dispute was settled in 1960 as part of an agreement between the governments of India and Pakistan. ==References== Category:Punjab, India",
