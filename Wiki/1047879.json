 "text": "\"My Block\" is the second single off of American rapper Scarface's seventh studio album The Fix. The song was released on July 30, 2002. The song samples the 1971 Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway song \"Be Real Black For Me\". The song was able to make it to #46 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In the song, Scarface raps about the place he grew up in. He raps all of the things that happen on his block like hustling and selling drugs. Scarface says he loves his block and he wouldn't trade it for anything. A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Mark Klasfeld. The video starts with sirens and somebody throwing shoes on a telephone wire, which is a sign of gang turf or a murder that took place there. Throughout the entire video, the camera pans to the left and around the neighborhood. It is shot with a 33 millimeter. Many different things are shown like a woman give birth and a dead body being stretched away next to her, African Americans and police fighting each other, breakdancers, a fight then candle light vigil, a man selling his mixtapes out of the back of his car, and a mural of Scarface. The video ends how it began, with another pair of shoes being thrown on the same telephone wire after another murder. A message on a billboard in the background reads \"What is in the beginning will be in the end\". ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2002 songs Category:Hip hop songs",
