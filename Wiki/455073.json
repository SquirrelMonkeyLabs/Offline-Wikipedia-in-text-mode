 "text": "Girl power is a term used to say that girls are important; it became popular because of the Spice Girls' use of the term. It was also used by the band, Bikini Kill. The phrase is sometimes spelled \"grrrl power\". This is because of the Riot grrrl punk rock bands. \"Girl power\" was also used by other bands in the early 1990s. One was a Welsh indie rock band Helen Love. Another was a south-east London punk rock band, Shampoo. They released an album and a single titled Girl Power in 1995. == References == Category:Feminism Category:Punk rock",
