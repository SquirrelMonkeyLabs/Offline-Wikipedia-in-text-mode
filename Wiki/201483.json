 "text": "The Variegated Fritillary (Euptoieta claudia) is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. It is native to North America and South America. The Variegated Fritillary is closely related to butterflies in the genus Speyeria. It has some differences from Speyeria butterflies. Some of the differences are: Variegated Fritillaries have 2-3 broods per year vs. one per year in Speyeria. They travel more vs. staying in the same place. And they use a wide range of host plants vs. just violets. Variegated Fritillaries use passionflowers as a host plant. Because of this, Variegated Fritillaries have taxonomic links to the heliconians. Their flight is low and fast, and they are hard to approach. Its genus name was taken from the Greek word euptoietos meaning \"easily scared\".Rich Cech and Guy Tudor (2005). The Butterflies of the East Coast. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey. ==Description== The upper side of the wings is orange and black. The fore wing and hind wing have a row of submarginal black spots and black median lines running across the wings. (Submarginal means just inward of the wing edge. Median means through the center of the wing.)Bob Stewart, Priscilla Brodkin, and Hank Brodkin (2001). Butterflies of Arizona. West Coast Lady Press.Jim P. Brock and Kenn Kaufman (2003). Butterflies of North America. Houghton Mifflin, New York, NY. The underside of the fore wing is orange. The hind wing is mottled with browns and grays. There is a pale postmedian band (postmedian means just outward of the median). There is no silvering. The wingspan is 1.75-2.25 inches.Ernest M. Shull (1987). The Butterflies of Indiana. Indiana Academy of Science. ==Similar species== There is a butterfly similar to the Variegated Fritillary. It is the Mexican Fritillary (Euptoieta hegesia). The Mexican Fritillary is brighter orange. The upper side of its hind wing has more orange. The underside of its wings is plainer, with no submarginal spots or median black lines. ==Flight period== This species may be seen flying from April-October in the south. It flies in the north from summer to early fall.Thomas J. Allen, Jim P. Brock, and Jeffrey Glassberg (2005). Caterpillars in the Field and Garden. Oaxford University Press Inc., New York, NY. ==Habitat== This butterfly is found in different kinds of habitats. It can by found in clover fields, alfalfa fields, fields, pastures, waste areas, roadsides, and mountain meadows.David C. Iftner, John A. Shuey, and John V. Calhoun (1992). Butterflies and Skippers of Ohio. College of Biological Sciences and The Ohio State University. ==Nectar plants== The Variegated Fritillary has been seen on different kinds of flowers. Here is a list of them: *Apocynum sp. - dogbane *Asclepias syriaca - Common Milkweed *Aster sp. - asters *Bidens aristosa - Bearded Beggerticks *Cirsium sp. - thistles *Echinacea sp. - coneflowers *Erigeron sp. - fleabane *Eupatorium perfoliatum - Common Boneset *Medicago sativa - Alfalfa *Trifolium pratense - Red Clover *Vernonia sp. - ironweed Judy Burris and Wayne Richards (2006). The Life Cycle of Butterflies. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA. ==Life cycle== Females lay their eggs singly on the host plant's leaves and stems. The eggs are pale green or cream colored. The caterpillar eats the leaves, flowers, and stems of the food plant.James A. Scott (1986). The Butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California. The caterpillar is red with black stripes. There are white spots in the black stripes. In many individuals, the white is more noticeable than the black.David L. Wagner (2005). Caterpillars of Eastern North America. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey. It has six rows of black spines. It has a pair of long, clubbed spines on the head. The chrysalis is shiny white with small black spots. It has a variable amount of brown markings and has orange and gold projections. Adults overwinter in the south and fly north each spring and summer. It has 2-3 broods per year. ==Host plants== Here is a list of host plants that the Variegated Fritillary caterpillar eats: * Boerhaavia intermedia - Five-wing Spiderling * Cynanchum arizonicum - Arizona Swallow-wort * Hybanthus verticillatus - Babyslippers * Linum australe - Southern Flax * Linum rigidum - Stiffstem Flax * Linum sulcatum - Grooved Yellow Flax * Menispermum canadense - Canadian Moonseed * Menispermum mexicanum - Mexican Moonseed * Passiflora caerulea - Blue Passionflower * Passiflora foetida - Foetid Passionflower * Passiflora incarnate - Purple Passionflower * Plantago sp. - plantain * Podophyllum peltatum - Mayapple * Portulaca oleracea - Common Purslane * Turnera ulmifolia - Yellow Alder * Sedum lanceolatum - Lance-leaf Stonecrop * Viola bicolor - American Field Pansy * Viola sororia - Common Blue Violet * Viola tricolor ssp. - Heartsease ==References== Category:Nymphalidae",
