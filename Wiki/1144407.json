 "text": "The papal tiara or triregnum is a special crown worn by Popes of the Catholic Church in the past. It has three layers and is often decorated with jewels and a cross on top. The tiara is a symbol of the pope's authority. == Description == The papal tiara is shaped like a tall, pointed hat with three crowns stacked one on top of the other. It usually has a cross at the top and two long cloth ribbons hanging down the back, called lappets. == History == The use of the papal tiara started around the 8th century. Over the centuries, many popes received their own tiaras, often made with valuable materials like gold, silver, and precious stones. Each new tiara was usually designed to be unique, symbolizing the popeâ€™s individual position in history. In 1964, Pope Paul VI was the last pope to wear the papal tiara. He gave his tiara away to support charity, marking a change in the way popes showed their role. Since then, no pope has worn the tiara, although it remains a symbol of the pope's authority. == Modern Use == Although popes today do not wear the tiara, it still appears in the coat of arms of the Vatican City and the Holy See. However, it does not appear in the papal coat of arms because Pope Benedict XVI replaced it with a mitre. == Related pages == * Fanon * Chasuble * Pallium == References == Category:Christian symbols Category:Liturgical clothing Category:Christian clothing",
