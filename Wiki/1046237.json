 "text": "Yoshikazu Higashitani (Japanese: 東谷 義和, born October 6, 1971), also known as GaaSyy (Japanese: ガーシー), is a former Japanese politician and YouTuber. In 2022, GaaSyy started a YouTube channel. He became famous by exposing scandals in the entertainment industry and Japanese talents on his channel. He ran in the 2022 Japanese House of Councillors election and was elected. In July 2022, he moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Although he was a member of the House of Councillors, he never attended the parliamentary sessions. This is because he thought that the Japanese talents who were slandered by GaaSyy would bring a criminal charge and he might be arrested. In the end, GaaSyy was expelled from the parliament for not attending a single session. On April 14, 2023, GaaSyy was wanted internationally for slandering Japanese talents. GaaSyy was arrested in Dubai and deported to Japan. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:YouTubers Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Hyōgo Prefecture",
