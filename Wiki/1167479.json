Allah SWT gave him wisdom that is why he is called Luqman-ul-hakeem meaning Luqman the wise. His advice to his child; # Do not associate partners with Allah because Shirk is a great injustice. # Allah SWT is all aware of everything. # Pray Salat. # Enjoin good and forbid evil # Be patient during calamities. # Do not be arrogant and proud.",
