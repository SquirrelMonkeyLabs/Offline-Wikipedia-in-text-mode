 "text": "Davion Blessing (born July 1, 2001), known professionally as Dave Blunts, is an American rapper, singer and internet personality. He is best known for his single \"The Cup\" and his weight of 600 pounds. He started to release music in 2024. Before gaining fame, Blunts worked at a call center and lived off of social security. His song \"The Cup\" became viral on TikTok. Blunts said that he made the song after he had just gotten out of the hospital and was drinking lean everyday. He said he only took one day to make it. He released his first studio album Well Dude Here's My Thing on June 28, 2024. Blunts became more well known after he performed at Juice Wrld Day, a tribute concert to late rapper Juice Wrld on November 30, 2024. During his performance, Blunts sat on a purple couch and rapped while using an oxygen tank. The performance came a week after Blunts had gotten out of the hospital. He had been previously hospitalized for heart failure in 2023. This caused concern about his health from fans and rappers like Snoop Dogg. Blunts did not like this. He ranted during a concert saying \"get the fuck off my dick, Snoop Dogg\". Snoop later apologized to Blunts. In late 2024, Blunts was hospitalized for the flu. Afterwards, he claimed that he was focusing on living a healthier lifestyle. ==References== Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:21st- century American musicians Category:21st-century American rappers Category:African-American rappers Category:Musicians from Iowa Category:Musicians from Utah Category:People from Davenport, Iowa Category:Trap musicians",
