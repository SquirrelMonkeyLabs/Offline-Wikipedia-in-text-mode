 "text": "Henry VI is a series of three history plays by William Shakespeare. They are set during the lifetime of King Henry VI of England. Henry VI, Part 1 deals with the loss of England's French territories and the politics leading up to the Wars of the Roses. Henry VI, Part 2 shows the King's inability to deal with the quarrelling nobles, and the armed conflict which follows. Henry VI, Part 3 deals with the horrors of that conflict. In 2016, scholars working on the New Oxford Shakespeare editions, announced that they were crediting Shakespeare's colleague and rival, Christopher Marlowe, as the co-author of the trilogy. == References == Category:Plays by William Shakespeare Category:Plays by Christopher Marlowe Category:Plays based on English history Category:1590s plays",
