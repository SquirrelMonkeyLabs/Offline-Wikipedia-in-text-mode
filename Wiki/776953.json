Most of its back is a mixture of light brown and dark brown in color. This frog has up-and-down lines on its lower eyelids and gold coloring on its legs and middle. The scientific name of this species chryptochrysos comes from the Greek kryptos for \"hidden\" and chrysos for \"gold,\" meaning the gold color on the middle of this frog's body. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
