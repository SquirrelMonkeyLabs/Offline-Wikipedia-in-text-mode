 "text": "In chemistry, specifically Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, an acid and base are conjugates if they can change into each other by adding or removing a hydrogen ion. An acid-base reaction is a reaction where an acid and a base are converted into their conjugate base and conjugate acid: deprotonation of the acid and protonation of the base. == Example == A common example of acid-base reaction is the reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid to make sodium chloride (salt) and water: : In Brønsted–Lowry theory, the reaction is written as : because the sodium ion doesn't change (it is a spectator ion). Since loses hydrogen to become , chloride is the conjugate base of hydrochloric acid. Since gains hydrogen to become , water is the conjugate acid of hydroxide.",
