 "text": "The Smashing Pumpkins (or simply Smashing Pumpkins) are an American rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 and disbanded on December 2, 2000. They later reformed in 2006 and are together at the moment. The members until 2000 were Billy Corgan (vocals, guitars and writes almost all of the band's songs), James Iha (guitars), D'Arcy Wretzky (bass) and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums). They are set to release an album in 2024 or 2025, produced by Howard Willing. Billy Corgan has stated that the lead single might come out in summer 2024. It will contain 12 songs, according to Corgan. Contrary to this statement, the ten- song album, Aghori Mhori Mei, dropped on August 2, 2024. It received acclaim from critics. They were made famous by hit singles like \"Today\", \"Rocket\", \"Disarm\", \"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\", \"1979\", \"Zero\" and \"Tonight, Tonight\". Their style was mainly alternative rock, but also influenced by the grunge movement of the early 1990s as well as heavy metal, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, and later, electronica. ==Discography== * Gish (1991) * Siamese Dream (1993) * Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995) * Adore (1998) * Machina/The Machines of God (2000) * Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music (2000) * Zeitgeist (2007) * Teargarden by Kaleidyscope (released beginning in 2009) * Oceania (2012) * Monuments to an Elegy (2014) * Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past.
