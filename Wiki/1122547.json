 "text": "The Ranita Dorada Reserve, Ranita Dorada Amphibian Reserve, or Reserva Ranita Dorada is a place in Colombia. It is a piece of cloud forest where people may only use some of the trees and other things people could need so that the animals there can live without people. ==History== Three groups, IUCN Netherlands, Dendrobatidae Nederland, and Conservation International and Netherlands Postcode Lottery, asked the government of Colombia to make the place into a reserve. They made the reserve in 2008. They asked so that two frog species would have a place to live: Andinobates doriswainsonae and Andinobates tolimense. ==Animals== Many plants and animals live in the reserve, for example birds, mammals, snakes, and frogs. These are some of the animals that live in the reserve: *Cochranella rosada *Cochranella susatamai *Cochranella punctulata *Centrolene prosoblepon *Centrolene robledoi *Bolitoglossa lozanoi *Eleutherodactylus fallax *Eleutherodactylus penelopus *Eleutherodactylus raniformis ==Place== This reserve is in Tolima, Colombia (5º 01'N 75º 02'W) between 1580 and 1900 meters above sea level. It is 284 acres in size. It is a lower montane wet forest, or cloud forest. It rains between 2,000 and 2,500 mm each year.
