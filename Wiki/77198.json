 "text": "The Mali Federation was a country in the west of Africa. Senegal and Mali came together and made this country. (Mali's name was French Sudan at that time). It started on April 4 1959 and it was controlled by France. However, it became independent on June 20 1960. The Federation's prime minister was Modibo Ke√Øta, and the government was in Dakar. The Federation ended a short time after independence because Senegal left on August 20 1960 because they had a disagreement about politics.
