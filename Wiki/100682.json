 "text": "Super Mario Bros. 2 is the second game of the Mario series. It is the name of two different games. In Japan, the game was created by Nintendo. Shigeru Miyamoto thought that the original Super Mario Bros. 2 was too hard for Americans, and decided to remake a Japanese game called Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, and replaced the old characters with the Mario characters Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad. The game was much different from other Mario games because of this. == Gameplay == This game features four characters: Toad, Luigi, Mario, and Princess Peach. Each one has different characteristics. Luigi can jump higher than the other characters, Peach can stay afloat for a few seconds longer than the others when jumping, Toad can pull items out of the ground quicker whilst Mario has generic all-round abilities. The player can pick the character at the start of each level. Unlike the regular Mario games, Mario and his friends have vegetables and can pick up some enemies and throw them.
