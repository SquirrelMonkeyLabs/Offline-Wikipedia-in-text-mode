 "text": "The Castle of Otranto is a 1764 novel by English author Horace Walpole. It is considered the first Gothic novel and played a significant role in founding the Gothic fiction genre. Walpole published the novel initially under a pseudonym, claiming it was a translation of an Italian manuscript from 1529. The book combines supernatural elements, medieval settings, and themes of love, power, and betrayal, all of which became hallmarks of Gothic fiction. == Background == Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto following a dream that inspired the novel's surreal and supernatural qualities. He sought to blend the realistic narrative style of the modern novel with elements of medieval romance and ancient drama, thus creating a new genre that incorporated elements of mystery, horror, and suspense. Initially, Walpole published the book under the guise of a rediscovered manuscript by \"William Marshal, Gent.\" It was presented as a piece of ancient literature, a common practice at the time for works that sought to evoke a sense of historical authenticity. However, in the book's second edition, Walpole admitted authorship, explaining his intentions to create \"a work founded on imagination and improbable incidents.\" == Plot Summary == The story takes place in the castle of the Prince of Otranto, Manfred, who is desperate to secure his family’s legacy after the sudden death of his son, Conrad, crushed by a gigantic helmet on the morning of his wedding to the beautiful Isabella. Manfred, believing his family is cursed, decides to divorce his wife, Hippolita, and marry Isabella himself to produce an heir. However, supernatural events begin to unfold within the castle, including ghostly apparitions and moving portraits. Isabella escapes Manfred’s advances and takes refuge in the castle’s labyrinthine passages. She is aided by a mysterious young man named Theodore, who becomes entangled in Manfred's quest for power. As the story progresses, it is revealed that the castle and the principality of Otranto are subject to an ancient prophecy foretelling the end of Manfred’s line. The novel culminates in tragic revelations and the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecy, resulting in Manfred’s downfall. == See Also == * Gothic fiction * Horace Walpole * Strawberry Hill House * Gothic Revival architecture == References == == Other websites == * Project Gutenberg – The Castle of Otranto * British Library – The Castle of Otranto * The Lewis Walpole Library Category:1760s books Category:English novels",
