 "text": "Punishment is when something is done to a person (or animal) that they do not like. It may be because they broke a rule. There are many kinds of punishment, from a death penalty for very bad crimes, to things that parents may do to punish children, like spanking them or taking away their toys. People are often sent to prison as punishment for a crime. Punishment can be seen as good in society to prevent people from doing bad things. It can also be seen as cruel and unnecessary. It can also be seen to do more harm than good. == Related pages == *Cruel and unusual punishment *Deterrence (legal) *Torture *Zero tolerance Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Criminal justice",
