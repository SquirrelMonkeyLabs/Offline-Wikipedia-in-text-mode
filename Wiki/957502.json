 "text": "Fernando de Noronha () is an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, off the Brazilian coast. It consists of 21 islands and islets, extending over an area of . Only the main island is inhabited. It has an area of and a population estimated at 3,101 in 2020. Most of the archipelago is low-lying, but there are some parts that reach in elevation. The archipelago is part of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. The islands are administratively unique in Brazil. They form a \"state district\" () that is administered directly by the government of the state of Pernambuco (even though they are closer to the state of Rio Grande do Norte). The state district's jurisdiction also includes the very remote Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, located northeast of Fernando de Noronha. Seventy percent of the islands' area was established in 1988 as a national marine park. In 2001, UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site because of its importance as a feeding ground for tuna, sharks, turtles, and marine mammals. Its time zone is UTC−02:00 all year round. == References == == Gallery == File:Map of Fernando de Noronha-en.svg|Map of the Archipelago File:Fernando de Noronha Insel Strand (22202712732).jpg|Fernando de Noronha Conceição beach File:Fernando de Noronha - Pernambuco - Brasil(3).jpg|Landscape in Fernando de Noronha File:Canhão - antiga proteção de Fernando de Noronha.jpg|Historic fortifications File:Fernando de Noronha - dois Irmãos - praia do sancho.jpg|Aerial view File:Fernando de Noronha Insel Strand (22027409470).jpg|Fernando de Noronha beach File:Fernando de Noronha - PE - Atalaia 2.jpg|Crystalline water File:Fernando de Noronha - PE - Baia do Sancho - Sub Aquatica.jpg|Underwater File:Fernando de Noronha - PE - Baia do Sancho.jpg|Sancho Bay File:Fernando de Noronha - PE - Baia dos Golfinhos.jpg|Spinner dolphins in Dolphin Bay File:Fernando de Noronha - PE - Dois Irmãos.jpg|Two Brothers Rock (Morro Dois Irmãos) File:Fernando de Noronha - PE- Cacimba do Padre.jpg|Cacimba do Padre File:Fernando de noronha- PE.jpg|Cacimba do Padre Beach File:Ponta da Sapata.jpg|Ponta da Sapata File:Morro Dois Irmãos - Fernando de Noronha.jpg|Two Brothers Rock File:Por do sol em Noronha.jpg|Sunset File:Fernando de Noronha Naturpool.jpg|Fernando de Noronha snorkeling File:Fernando de Noronha Strand Baia do Sancho (22027580168).jpg|Fernando de Noronha beach Sancho Bay Category:Islands of South America Category:Atlantic islands",
