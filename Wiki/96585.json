 "text": "Greiz is a Landkreis (rural district) in the east of Thuringia, Germany. == History == Historically the area of the district was part of the Vogtland, named after the title Vogt given to the local rulers in the 13th century. Only two lines of the Reuß family survived from that time, with one principality based in Greiz, and the other in Gera and Schleiz. In 1919 both were merged into the Volksstaat Reuß (People's State of Reuss), which then became part of Thuringia in 1920. A subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp was located at Berga/Elster during World War II. The SS made inmates dig tunnels and lay railway tracks for the Schwalbe V project.Edward Victor. Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps. www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps.htm The district in its current form was created on July 1, 1994, when the districts Gera-Land, Zeulenroda and the previous district Greiz were merged. == Coat of arms == Both the lion as well as the crane-bird in the top part of the coat of arms are from the coat of arms of the Reuß families and their principalities. In the bottom is a part of the coat of arms of Saxony, as a small part of the district belonged to the Duchies of Saxony. ==Towns and municipalities== Verwaltungsgemeinschaft-free towns and municipalities # Bad Köstritz # Berga/Elster # Greiz # Ronneburg # Weida # Zeulenroda-Triebes # Caaschwitz # Crimla # Harth-Pöllnitz # Hartmannsdorf # Kraftsdorf # Langenwetzendorf # Langenwolschendorf 8.
