 "text": "Acetylornithine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.11) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction: N2-acetyl-L-ornithine + 2-oxoglutarate \\rightleftharpoons N-acetyl- L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde + L-glutamate This reaction plays a crucial role in the urea cycle and amino acid metabolism by transferring nitrogenous groups. The enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases. It requires the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate to function. == Reaction == The enzyme's substrates are N2-acetyl-L-ornithine and 2-oxoglutarate, and its products are N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde and L-glutamate. == Alternative Names == Several alternative names are used for acetylornithine transaminase, including: * Acetylornithine delta-transaminase * ACOAT * Acetylornithine 5-aminotransferase * N-acetylornithine-delta- transaminase * Succinylornithine aminotransferase == Structural Information == As of 2007, six structures have been solved for this enzyme class, with PDB accession codes: 1VEF, 1WKG, 1WKH, 2E54, 2EH6, and 2ORD. == References == Category:Enzymes",
