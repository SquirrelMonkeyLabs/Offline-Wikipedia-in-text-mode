Its capital is Ciego de Ávila, which lies on the Carretera Central (central highway), and the second city is Morón, farther north. Off the north coast of the province are a string of cayos (cays) - these islands are being developed as tourist resorts, principally Cayo Coco and Cayo Guillermo. The south coast is characterised by mangroves. Between Morón and the north coast are several lakes, including La Laguna de Leche (the Lake of Milk, so called for its white appearance because of large lime deposits underwater) which is the largest natural lake in Cuba. Central Ciego de Ávila is used for cattle ranching, elsewhere in the province sugar, pineapples and citrus fruit are grown. The province was separated from Camagüey Province in 1975 by Fidel Castro's government. == Municipalities == # Baraguá (Gaspar) # Bolivia # Chambas # Ciego de Ávila # Ciro Redondo # Florencia # Majagua # Morón # Primero de Enero # Venezuela Category:Provinces of Cuba Category:1975 establishments in North America Category:20th-century establishments in Cuba",
