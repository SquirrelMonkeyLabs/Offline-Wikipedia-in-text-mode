 "text": "\"To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants\" is the second part of the sixteenth episode of the sixth season of SpongeBob SquarePants. It was first shown on television on July 17, 2009 as a part of the television marathon called \"The Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash Weekend.\" A DVD version of the episode was made on July 21, 2009 and has other season six episodes in it. == Plot == A narrator tells about the time SpongeBob changes his pants by starting with SpongeBob puttting his pairs of pants in a dryer. Patrick calls him and makes noises with his tongue. When Patrick stops, SpongeBob checks the dryer and finds out his pants have shrunk. A mall worker tells him that square pants will not be shipped in months. SpongeBob then looks around the mall for a different type of pants. He ends up finding a pair of round pants and decides to buy them. SpongeBob later meets Patrick, who does not recognize him in his round pants. Sandy and Squidward pretend to not recognize him either. Patrick won't let SpongeBob in his house because he says the house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob thinks no one will recognize him in his round pants, so he goes to the Krusty Krab to get hired again. Mr. Krabs does not pretend to not recognize SpongeBob and tells him to get to work. Squidward shows SpongeBob how to be a bad worker without telling him in hopes of getting him fired. Mr. Krabs catches Squidward and SpongeBob sleeping on the job and gets mad. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he can not be \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" because of his round pants. Mr. Krabs tells him to just take off his round pants, leaving him in his underwear. Sandy teases SpongeBob by calling him \"SpongeBob UnderPants,\" making him scream and ending the episode. == Feedback == Paul Mavis of DVD Talk gave a positive response and says that \"There are laughs in 'To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants.'\" Judge Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict gave the episode a score of 5 out of 10 and said that \"[the episode] was one of the slighter entries [on the DVD] with the core joke being fairly well-handled with no one recognizing SpongeBob, but it went on just a little too long.\" == References == Category:SpongeBob SquarePants episodes Category:2009 television episodes",
