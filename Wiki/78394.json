They play their home games at the Kaseya Center and won three championships in 2006, 2012, and 2013. Led by Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal, they won the 2006 NBA Finals where they defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4 games to 2 after trailing two games to zero. Wade was the Finals MVP. During the 2010 off- season, the Heat acquired LeBron James and Chris Bosh from the Cleveland Cavaliers and Toronto Raptors, respectively to team up with 2003 fellow draftee Wade, making the Heat favorites to win multiple championships. With a \"Big Three\" of Wade, LeBron, and Bosh, Miami reached four consecutive Finals from 2011â€“2014. Miami met Dallas again in the Finals in 2011 with the Mavericks winning the rematch 4 games to 2. The Heat won again in the 2012 NBA Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4 games to 1. LeBron was the Finals MVP for the first time in his career. They also defeated the San Antonio Spurs in 2013 Finals 4 games to 3, handing the Spurs their first-ever Finals loss. LeBron was the Finals MVP for the second straight year. In the 2014 Finals, the Heat were attempting a three-peat and once again faced the Spurs, with the Spurs winning in five games. After four years with the Heat, LeBron returned to the Cavaliers. Lead by Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, and Tyler Herro, the Heat made two more Finals. They returned to the Finals in 2020, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers (led by former Heat player James) in six games. Three years later, the Heat made their seventh Finals appearance, this time against the Denver Nuggets, losing in five games. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:National Basketball Association teams Category:Sports in Miami Category:1988 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Florida Category:Sports organizations based in Florida",
