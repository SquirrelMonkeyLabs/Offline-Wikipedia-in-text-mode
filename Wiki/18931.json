 "text": "Richard Buckminster \"Bucky\" Fuller (July 12, 1895 – July 1, 1983) was an American architect, engineer, author, designer, inventor and futurist. Fuller published more than 30 books, inventing and popularizing terms such as \"Spaceship Earth\", and \"Synergetics\". He also used inventions, mainly architectural designs. The best known of which is the geodesic dome, the pinnacle of which would be a 5 kilometer diameter dome over Manhattan, as well as cloud nine. Carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their resemblance to geodesic spheres. == Some of his books == * Nine chains to the Moon (1938) * Untitled epic poem on the history of industrialization (1962) * Ideas and integrities, a spontaneous autobiographical disclosure (1963) * No more secondhand god and other writings (1963) * What I have learned: a collection of 20 autobiographical essays, Chapter \"How little I know\", (1968) * Operating manual for Spaceship Earth (1969) * Utopia or oblivion (1969) * Approaching the benign environment (1970) (with Eric A.
