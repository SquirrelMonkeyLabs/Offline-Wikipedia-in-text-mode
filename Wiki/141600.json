 "text": "Mmhmm is the fourth album made by Relient k. It has other spellings because it's a strange word. It is different from the bands previous albums, because it's heavier but also softer at times with the music. It marks the time where the band became more serious, using fewer joke songs than before. This was their first album on their record label Capitol Records. It was also the last CD which Brian Pitman (Relient k bassist) recorded with the band. The album was released again, with a new song which was first found on an EP. In 2005, the album was given gold status, because it had sold half a million copies in America. The album had a few singles which were played only on Christian radio such as \"High of 75\" and \"I so hate consequences\". == Songs == # The One I'm Waiting For # Be My Escape # High of 75 # I So Hate Consequences # The Only Thing Worse Than Beating A Dead Horse Is Betting On One # My Girls Ex- Boyfriend # More Than Useless # Which To Bury, Us Or The Hatchet? # Let It All Out # Who I Am Hates Who I've Been # Maintain Counciousness # This Week The Trend # Life After Death And Taxes # When I Go Down Category:2004 albums",
