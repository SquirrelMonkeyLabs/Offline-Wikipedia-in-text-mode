 "text": "The motor system is the part of the central nervous system that is involved with movement. It consists of the pyramidal and extrapyramidal system. * The pyramidal motor system, (or pyramidal tract or corticospinal tract) starts in the motor center of the cerebral cortex and goes through the midbrain and medulla oblongata, then down the spinal cord. Peripheral motor nerves carry the motor impulses to the voluntary muscles.Rizzolatti G. & Luppino G. 2001. The cortical motor system. Neuron 31: 889-901. SD * The extrapyramidal motor system consists of motor-modulation systems, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum. This tweaks the messages so that fine, accurate movement is possible. That function is called \"modulation of movement\". Both systems are very ancient and may be common to all vertebrates.Extrapyramidal System: children of the Amphioxus == References == Category:Nervous system",
