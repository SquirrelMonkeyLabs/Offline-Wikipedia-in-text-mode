 "text": "Phosgene is the chemical compound with the formula COCl2. This gas has no color. The gas was used as a weapon during World War I. It is responsible for most of the deaths related to poison gas during the war. Today, phosgene is used as a tool. It is used for organic synthesis. When there is a small amount in the air, the smell is similar to that of freshly cut hay or grass. Some soldiers during the First World War have stated that it smelled a little like May Blossom. When some compounds of chlorine and carbon burn or break down, small amounts of phosgene are given off.Wolfgang Schneider and Werner Diller \"Phosgene\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. DOI: 10.1002/14356007.a19_411. Article Online Posting Date: June 15, 2000 == Uses == Today, most phosgene is an ingredient in plastics. It reacts with bisphenol A or similar chemicals (diols) to make polycarbonates, and with amines to make isocyanates, especially toluene diioscyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), which are used to make polyurethanes. Polycarbonates are an important class of engineering thermoplastic. They can be found in lenses in eyeglasses. Polyurethane is a class of materials with many different uses, especially foams, fibers, and coatings. ==Safety== Phosgene is a strong poison. Its smell may not be noticed. Signs of exposure may sometimes be detected slowly. Phosgene can be seen at 0.4 parts per million. This amount is four times the safe amount. Its high ability to poison doesn't come from the hydrogen chloride released by a process. It comes from the action of the phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary sac of the lungs. The sacs are where the oxygen goes into the body. Their damage makes it hard for the blood and air move oxygen and carbon. This will make breathing very hard. Badges are worn by those at risk of exposure. Sodium bicarbonate may be used to make spills of phosgene harmless. Gas spills may be made harmless with a special liquid spray. == Other websites == * Davy's account of his discovery of phosgene * International Chemical Safety Card 0007 * NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards * U.S. CDC Emergency Preparedness & Response * U.S. EPA Acute Exposure Guideline Levels * Regime For Schedule 3 Chemicals And Facilities Related To Such Chemicals , OPCW website * CBWInfo website * Use of Phosgene in WWII and in modern-day warfare (Refer to Section 4.C of the article) * Phosgene -Citizendium ==References== Category:Chemical warfare Category:Organochlorides",
