 "text": "\"You Won't See Me\" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles. It was written by Paul McCartney, but listed as Lennon-McCartney. It was first released on the band's 1965 album Rubber Soul. It is about McCartney's bad relationship with Jane Asher at the time, when she wanted to become an actress. It was recorded during a very long recording session in November 1965. Author Mark Lewisohn called this final recording session a \"marathon\" recording session, because it lasted all through the night. This was to make sure Rubber Soul was released before Christmas. ==Personnel== According to Ian MacDonald: *Paul McCartney – double-tracked lead vocal, bass guitar, piano *John Lennon – backing vocal, tambourine *George Harrison – backing vocal, lead guitar *Ringo Starr – drums, hi-hat *Mal Evans – Hammond organ ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:The Beatles songs Category:1965 songs Category:Anne Murray songs",
