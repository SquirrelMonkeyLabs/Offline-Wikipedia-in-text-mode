It included Mohican, Wappinger, and Munsee (a sub-tribe of the Lenape). Most tribes of the Northeastern Woodlands allied with the British. The militia fought in the Siege of Boston, the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga, the Siege of Ticonderoga, the Battle of Saratoga, and the Battle of Monmouth. They had a major loss at the Battle of Kingsbridge or The Stockbridge Massacre. This battle was the last that the Stockbridge Militia would fight.Frazier, Patrick.
