 "text": "The Himalayan whipping frog or Himalayan tree frog (Polypedates himalayensis) is a frog. It lives in Bhutan and India. People have seen it between 100 and 2000 meters above sea level. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Polypedates maculatus. This frog can lay eggs in streams, rice paddies, wetlands, canals, and other bodies of water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it can live in places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
