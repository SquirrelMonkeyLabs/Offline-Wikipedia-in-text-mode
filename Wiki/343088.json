Andromeda XIX is said to be \"the most extended dwarf galaxy known in the Local Group\", and has a half-light radius of 1.7 kiloparsec (kpc). It was found by the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, and it is a dwarf galaxy. == History == The MegaPrime/MegaCam 1 deg2 (camera) on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) had mapped the M31 stellar halo (one quarter) up to ~150 kpc. The observation, which had proved the uneveness of Andromeda's stellar halo, had shown that multiple other dwarf galaxies exist. They are: Andromeda XI, XII, XIII, XV, XVI, XVIII, XIX, and XX. ==Related pages== *Andromeda Galaxy *Local Group == References == Category:Local galaxies Category:Dwarf galaxies",
