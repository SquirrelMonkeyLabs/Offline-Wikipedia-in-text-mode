 "text": "Viral entry is when a virus goes into the cell that it has infected. It is the first part of the virusâ€™s life. Most viruses share some basics steps (in order); # The virus has to stick or attach to the outside of the cell. # Some proteins react to each other. # After that, there are a few different ways that viral entry can happen. == Viral entry == # The first way is called membrane fusion. The outside layer of the cell has a hole poked in it for the virus to go in. # Endocytosis. The cell thinks the virus is food and eats it. # The third way is Viral penetration. This is where the virus injects itself into the cell either chemically or with a part of its body == References == Category:Viruses Category:Virology",
