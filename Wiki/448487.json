 "text": "Hans Asperger (18 February 1906 â€“ 21 October 1980) was an Austrian doctor of children. Asperger syndrome (AS) was named after him. Today, Asperger syndrome is seen as a form of Autism. Asperger was born in Vienna and died there. Asperger studied medicine at the University of Vienna under Franz Hamburger. Because he wrote in German, his work was not widely known. It was only in the 1980s that it was translated. One of his students translated it in honor of Asperger. Hans Asperger worked in Austria when it was occupied by Nazi Germany. Some people say that he was complicit in the forced euthanasia of disabled children by the Nazis. == References == Category:1906 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Austrian physicians",
