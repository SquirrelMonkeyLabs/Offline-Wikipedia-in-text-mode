 "text": "Ken Barlow is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera Coronation Street, played by William Roache. Barlow was created by Tony Warren as one of Coronation Streets original characters, and December 2020 marked Ken's 60th anniversary onscreen. He debuted in the soap's first episode on 9 December 1960. Having appeared in the role continuously since that date, Roache is the longest-serving actor in a televised soap opera and was honoured at the 2010 Guinness World Records ceremony for the achievement, having surpassed actor Don Hastings from the American soap opera As the World Turns, who previously held this title. Roache stated in 2010 that he had no plans to leave the role and would remain in Coronation Street for as long as the producers would have him. In November 2020, Roache was again presented with the Guinness World Record for the longest serving TV soap star in the world for his six decades in Coronation Street. ==References== Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional characters introduced in the 1960s",
