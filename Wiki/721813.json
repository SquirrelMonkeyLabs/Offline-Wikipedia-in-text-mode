 "text": "Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2020 adventure movie. It is based on the video game series of the same name by Sega. It is directed by Jeff Fowler from a screenplay by Patrick Casey, Josh Miller, and Oren Uziel. It was originally going to be released on November 8, 2019, but had been delayed because the old design for Sonic was criticized by fans. The movie was released on February 14, 2020. A sequel to the movie titled Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released on April 8, 2022. == Plot == The film begins with Sonic running away from Dr. Robotnik. The movie then rewinds to the beginning. Sonic is shown running in Green Hill Zone, bringing back a flower to Longclaw, Sonic's guardian. Longclaw warns Sonic that somebody could have seen him, but Sonic doesn't believe her. It turns out she is right and multiple echidnas had seen him, and they attack them for his speed. Longclaw gives Sonic her rings, and tells him that they can travel between dimensions, and that Sonic should use them if he is ever spotted. Sonic uses the ring and goes to another dimension. He tries to get back to his home realm, but the gateway closes before he could do so. Ten years later, Sonic eventually finds his way into Earth. There, Tom Wackowski, on parking duty, is bored and is waiting for a car to speed. He finds a turtle, and his speed gun reads \"0.01\". Then, Sonic passes by, with his speed gun reading 296. He passes by again, this time his gun reads 300. The turtle is in the street, about to get run over when Sonic saves him, and brings him to a forest, and returns home. Sonic tells the viewers his life, then accidentally drops his rings. He picks them up, and then tells us that if he gets spotted, he will have to migrate to a mushroom planet. After watching a baseball game, that night, he plays baseball by himself, but realizes that he is alone and runs fast, accidentally causing an explosion that shuts down the electric power across the entire Pacific Coast. The government suggests Dr. Robotnik to figure this out. Dr. Robotnik joins the investigation, insulting the workers. He uses his technology and one of his drones finds a blue hair left from Sonic. Robotnik identifies this as a \"new species\". Seeing he is being hunted, Sonic plots to leave Earth for a different planet; he is reluctant to do so as the planet only consists of fungi. However, Tom discovers Sonic in his shed and tranquilizes him, causing Sonic to accidentally create a portal to the Transamerica Pyramid's tower roof upon reading the writing on Tom's shirt. Sonic accidentally drops his bag of rings on the tower's roof through the warp ring before he passes out. Tom hesitantly agrees to help Sonic and the two flee when confronted by Robotnik, who falsely labels Tom a domestic terrorist. The two slowly bond, with Tom relating to Sonic's desire for friends. Sonic creates a bucket list and Tom helps him complete several entries along their journey. Meanwhile, Robotnik, discovering that one of Sonic's quills holds an almost limitless amount of electrical energy, plans to capture Sonic to use his powers for his machines. As he tracks them down, Sonic and Tom manage to fight off several mechanized drones called Badniks sent by Robotnik, but Sonic is injured in the battle. Arriving in San Francisco, Tom brings Sonic to Maddie, who treats him at her sister Rachel's home. Sonic receives a new pair of red sneakers to replace his ruined ones from Rachel's daughter Jojo. The group heads to the roof of the tower and recovers the rings as Robotnik arrives in an advanced attack hovercraft powered by the quill, now decked in a red and pink flight suit and red flight goggles. Sonic fights off Robotnik's Badniks, hastily using one of his Warp Rings to send Tom and Maddie back to a Green Hills farm to protect them after pushing them off the tower; however, Robotnik uses the quill's power to match Sonic's speed. Sonic fights Robotnik in a chase across the world utilizing the Warp Rings before Robotnik subdues Sonic in Green Hills. Tom and the townsfolk intervene, and Tom acknowledges Sonic as his friend, causing Sonic to regain his power. Sonic takes back his quill's power from Robotnik, weakening Robotnik's hovercraft. Sonic also promises himself that he will always use his power to protect his friends. Using his powerful spin attack, Sonic obliterates Robotnik's hovercraft and defeats him by banishing him into a warp ring portal to the mushroom planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them, treating him as a surrogate son. The government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence, rewarding Tom and Maddie with an Olive Garden gift card as a small token of gratitude. Three months later, Robotnik, now bald and with a larger moustache, is still in possession of Sonic's quill and usable equipment salvaged from the remains of his hovercraft, planning his return and revenge against Sonic. == Cast == ===Voice cast=== * Ben Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog.
