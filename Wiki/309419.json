The anthem replaced \"Amhr√°n na bhFiann\" because the players had came from both parts of the island of Ireland. == Lyrics == In most games today, the first part has been sung, then the chorus two times. Part 1 Come the day and come the hour Come the power and the glory We have come to answer our country's call From the four proud provinces of Ireland Chorus Ireland, Ireland Together standing tall Shoulder to shoulder We'll answer Ireland's call Part 2 From the mighty glens of Antrim From the rugged hills of Galway From the walls of Limerick and Dublin Bay From the four proud provinces of Ireland Part 3 Hearts of steel and heads unbowing Vowing never to be broken We will fight until we can fight no more For the four proud provinces of Ireland Part 4 Erin's warriors, clad in emerald Steadfast souls confront their challenge 'Neath the glass sky they assemble For the four proud provinces of Ireland Category:Sport in Ireland Category:Sports team songs Category:Irish culture",
