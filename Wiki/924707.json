She then worked as an indigenous communication officer with a bauxite mining company in Weipa, on the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. She then became the campaign director at \"Seed Indigenous Youth Climate Network\". She also works as a volunteer impact coordinator with \"Environmental Film Festival Australia\". She is also a community organizer for \"Our Islands, Our Home\". King represented \"Seed Indigenous Youth Climate Network\" and \"Our Islands, Our Home\" at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow in November 2021. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, she was one of relatively few Australians to participate in the event. She first got awareness of the impact of climate change when she saw the impact of sea erosion on the graveyard of her ancestors on Masig Island. There was a picking up of their bones for reburial. There was also disappearance of the fishes from traditional fishing grounds. She declared the federal government of Australia as unfit. It was because of the failure to make indigenous people reach net zero emissions by 2050. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Climate activists Category:Australian activists",
