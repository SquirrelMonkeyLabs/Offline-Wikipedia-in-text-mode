When Slint recorded the album, the members of the band were Brian McMahan (singing and guitar), David Pajo (guitar), Todd Brashear (bass guitar) and Britt Walford (drums). Spiderland was engineered by Brian Paulson. The band ended before the album was released. It ended because McMahan had depression. In the US, the album was not popular when it was released. However, many music critics in the United Kingdom liked the album. The album got a cult following. Many music writers think Spiderland was important in making post-rock and math rock popular in the 1990s. In 2005, Slint got back together to do a concert tour. They played the full album at every concert. == Track listing == All music written by Slint. Words by Brian McMahan and Britt Walford. ==References== Category:1991 albums",
