 "text": "Winger is an American metal band from in New York City. Winger became popular during the late 1980s and early 1990s from songs like Seventeen, Headed for a Heartbreak and Miles Away. As the music scene changed in the early to mid-1990s with the popularity of grunge music, the band lost popularity after their third album Pull. After the band broke up in 1994, some of the band members began solo careers. The band reunited in 2001 with a new guitarist (John Roth). In 2006, the band's 1993 touring line-up (except for Paul Taylor) re-united to record the band's first studio album in over 13 years, IV. In 2009 the band released a fifth album, Karma.
