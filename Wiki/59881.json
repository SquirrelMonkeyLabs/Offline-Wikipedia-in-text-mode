 "text": "John Hancock (January 12, 1737 â€“ October 8, 1793) was an early American patriot, a leader in the American Revolutionary War, and an American statesman. He was the first man to sign America's Declaration of Independence. Today in the United States, \"John Hancock\" is a synonym for signature.World Book Encyclopedia. 2012. Volume 9. Scott, Foresman. pp. 38-39. Hancock's ancestors arrived in the English colonies in 1652. In 1737, Hancock was born in Braintree (now Quincy, Massachusetts). When his father died, he was adopted by his uncle, a merchant in Boston, Massachusetts. At his uncle's death in 1754, Hancock inherited the business. He became a leading merchant in Boston and one of the richest in the colonies. In 1768, British officials seized Hancock's ship, the Liberty, and accused him of smuggling. The Liberty was carrying a shipment of wine at the time. Patriots in Boston rioted, and Hancock was acquitted. This was one of the events that led to the American Revolutionary War. Hancock had several important jobs in Colonial America and the early United States of America. He was president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in 1774 and 1775. He used his money to support American independence. The British thought him a very dangerous man. Hancock was president of the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775. He wanted to lead the Continental Army, but George Washington got the job instead. With 5,000 troops, he tried to free Rhode Island from the British, but was not successful. Hancock led the convention that adopted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780. He was the first Governor of Massachusetts, and served nine terms. In his later life, Hancock suffered from gout. He died in 1793. == References == Category:1737 births Category:1793 deaths Hancock, John Hancock, John Hancock, John Category:People from Quincy, Massachusetts",
