 "text": "In wave physics, Dispersion is the idea that the frequency of a wave influences its velocity (speed). Dispersion is most easily seen in the refraction of light, when all the colors inside white light become separated by a prism. When a white beam is shone at the prism, all the colors in the light (color spectrum) are slowed when they meet the prism. Each color then refracts (bends) at a different angle, making us see a rainbow. Dispersion is also important in telecommunication when different parts of a signal arrive at different times. During Dispersion white light scatters into colors commonly listed as : Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red. These colors can be learned by the word ROYGBIV Each color has its own angle of refraction and angle of dispersion. Violet is on top, having the smallest angle of dispersion and maximum angle of refraction but for red light the angle of dispersion is maximum and the angle of refraction is smallest. We can also find the refractive index of any color as \" Sin[Angle of incidence] รท sin [ angle of refraction ] = refractive index \" According to this formula if angle of refraction is least then refractive index will be highest. And if angle of refraction is highest then refractive index will be lowest . Category:Wave physics",
