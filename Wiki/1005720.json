 "text": "The 'Miraculous Medal' is the medal with Mary, mother of Jesus on the front while crushing a serpent (representing the devil). She is represented with rays from her hands that are the symbol of the graces that the Blessed Virgin obtains for those who ask them of her. On the back is an M with a cross going through it and the two hearts of Jesus and of the Virgin Mary. The design of this sacred medal was originated by saint Catherine Labour√© following the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Paris, France. With the approval of the Catholic Church, the first medals were made in 1832 and distributed in Paris with a great diffusion also abroad in the subsequent years. To the Miraculous Medal are associated many graces. It is very popular and worn around the world. The feast of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal is celebrated on November 27 of each year. == Other websites == https://www.chapellenotredamedelamedaillemiraculeuse.com/langues/english/apparitions- et-la-medaille-miraculeuse-gb/ Category:Roman Catholicism",
