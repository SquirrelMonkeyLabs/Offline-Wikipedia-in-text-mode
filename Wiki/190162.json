 "text": "Toroidal inductors and transformers are a kind of electronic component. They typically consist of a circular, ring-shaped magnetic centre. The magnet is usually considered a monopole, although the central axis will have a dipole, and have the advantage of being wound continuously in a single direction, thus there is no inductive interference between windings as in a solenoid that is wound back and forth. == References == * * * * * ==Other websites== * Approximate inductance of a toroid includes formula, but assumes circular windings Category:Transformers (electrical) Category:Magnetism",
