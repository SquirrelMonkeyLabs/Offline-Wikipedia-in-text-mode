 "text": "Julius L. Meier (December 31, 1874 - July 14, 1937) was a businessman in Portland, Oregon, and governor of Oregon. He was born in Portland to German immigrants of Jewish ancestory: Aaron, a merchant and founder of Oregon's largest department store, Meier & Frank, and Jeannette (Hirsch) Meier. He had three siblings, and was the father of Jean Ellen, Elsa Francis, and Julius L., (Jack) Jr. He married Grace Mayer on Christmas Day, 1901, saying afterwards that it was the only day that he was allowed off from the store. Meier graduated from the University of Oregon Law School in 1895 and practiced law with a partner, George W. Joseph for the next four years, until he went into the family's business. According to family tradition, it was at this time that he added the \"L\" to his name; the sign painter, who was putting his name on the door, insisted that all lawyers of substance had one and Meier suggested an \"L\". Meier ran for governor as an independent candidate in 1930, winning 54.5 percent of the total vote, outdistancing his nearest competitor, Democratic candidate Edward F. Bailey, 135,608 votes to 62,434. After serving as governor, he retired to his estate above the Columbia River, \"Menucha\", where he later died. His family sold Menucha to First Presbyterian Church of Portland in 1950, which now operates it as a conference and retreat center. The Meier and Frank families sold the department store to the May Company in 1966. With May's sale to Federated in 2005, the store was renamed \"Macy's\" in September, 2006. == Other websites == * Julius L.
