He began playing in the National Hockey League with the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 1949–50 NHL season and retired after the 1959–60 season, having never played with another team. His brother-in-law, Pete Backor, was the first Stanley Cup winner of Slovak descent. He also was of Slovak descent, since both of his parents were born in what is today Slovakia. ==Other websites== * * Category:1928 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey centres Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Pittsburgh Hornets players Category:Rochester Americans players Category:Sportspeople from Thunder Bay Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players",
