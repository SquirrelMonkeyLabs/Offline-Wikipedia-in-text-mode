 "text": "Unsportsmanlike conduct (or unsporting behaviour, or ungentlemanly conduct) describes a kind of action by professional sportspeople. It is when a player or team acts during the game in a way that is not professional or is offensive. It is different to cheating or breaking the rules. Unsportsmanlike conduct is something most players and fans dislike. The official rules of many sports include a rule so that a referee can call unsportsmanlike conduct on a team or player. There may be a fine or penalty. == References == Category:Sports",
