 "text": "The Governor of Victoria represents the head of state, Charles III in the Australian state of Victoria. The Governor performs the same tasks at the state level as the Governor-General of Australia at the national level. The Governor's office and official residence is Government House in central Melbourne. The current Governor of Victoria is Margaret Gardner. ==Powers== In a Westminster system of parliamentary government, the Governor nearly always acts on the advice of the head of the elected government, the Premier of Victoria. However, the Governor retains the reserve powers of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier.Constitution of Victoria (1975), Part 1. ==Related offices== There is also a Lieutenant-Governor and an Administrator. The Chief Justice of Victoria is the Administrator, unless he or she is the Lieutenant-Governor, in which case, the next most senior judge is the Administrator. The Lieutenant-Governor takes on the job of the Governor when that post is vacant, when the Governor is out of the State, or is unable to act. The Administrator takes on those duties if both the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor are unable to act. ==Australian-born governors== The first Australian (and Victorian) born Governor of Victoria was Sir Henry Winneke (appointed 1974). Apart from Dr Davis McCaughey (b. Ireland), Professor David de Kretser (born in Ceylon) and Alex Chernov (born in Lithuania), all governors since 1974 have been born in Australia. ==List of governors of Victoria== ===Lieutenant-governors=== Before 1855, the Governor-General of New South Wales appointed Lieutenant-Governors to Victoria.
