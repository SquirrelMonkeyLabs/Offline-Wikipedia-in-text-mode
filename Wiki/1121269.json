 "text": "Alexandre Paul Rignault (14 February 1901 in Paris - 31 March 1985 in Saint- Mand√©) was a French actor in theatre, film and television. Alexandre Rignault began his professional career as an employee of a gasworks. Shortly afterwards he switched to acting and began to gain his first experience in an amateur theatre troupe. Tours took him through the French provinces. In 1926 he met Louis Jouvet, who took him into his acting troupe. Rignault stayed there for a total of five years. Rignault enjoyed great success alongside Jouvet in the play Knock, both in the theatre and in the two cinema versions. With the advent of the talkies, Alexandre Rignault first appeared in front of the camera. The Parisian-born actor mostly played supporting roles in films; he had leading roles as Inspector Juve in Fantomas and as Caderousse in The Count of Monte-Cristo. Rignault's repertoire of roles covered virtually the entire spectrum: he played both good-natured family men and villainous and brutal guys. Most recently, until shortly before his death, Rignault was also seen more frequently on television. ==Other websites== * Category:1901 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Actors from Paris Category:20th-century French actors",
