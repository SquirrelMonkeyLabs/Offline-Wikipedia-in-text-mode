 "text": "The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was a United States federal law which was signed by the then-President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. The law defined that marriage can only be between one man and one woman in regard to federal or interstate recognition purposes in the United States. Under this law, no U.S. State or political subdivision was required to recognize a same- sex marriage performed in another state. On June 26, 2013, Section 3 of the act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. On December 13, 2022, it was officially repealed and replaced by the Respect for Marriage Act. == References == == Other page == *Same-sex marriage in the United States Category:Same-sex marriage Category:LGBT rights in the United States Category:United States federal legislation Category:1996 in the United States Category:1990s in law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:American LGBT rights law",
