 "text": "The United States Military Academy at West Point (also known as West Point, USMA, Army (athletic teams)) is a university that teaches students to become officers in the US Army. Students are called \"cadets\" and are subject to military rules while studying subjects like engineering and military science for four years. For many years, West Point only taught men, but in 1976 West Point admitted its first female cadets.Barkalow (1990), p. 20. Women currently comprise approximately 15% of entering new cadets. Military officers compose 75% of the faculty. Civilian professors make up the remaining 25% of faculty positions. Congress formally authorized and funded West Point on 16 March 1802.Ambrose (1966), p. 22. West Point was so successful, that military academies were added later for the Navy, Coast Guard and Air Force. West Point was originally a Fort. The Continental Army used it to guard the Hudson River. General Benedict Arnold tried to betray it. ==Sports== West Point has a very broad sports program. All of its students are required to compete in at least one sport, either at the intramural (i.e., within the school) or intercollegiate (i.e., against other schools) level, in every semester. The Army intercollegiate sports teams are nicknamed \"Black Knights\". Most Army teams play in the Patriot League. The football team plays at the highest level, known as Division I FBS, in the American Athletic Conference. The men's ice hockey team plays in Atlantic Hockey America. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Other websites== * The Academy's official site * Army Black Knights official site Category:Military schools Army Army Category:1802 establishments in the United States Category:1800s establishments in New York (state)",
