 "text": "The Qianlong Emperor (25 September 1711 â€“ 7 February 1799) was the fifth Emperor of the Qing Dynasty and the fourth Qing emperor to rule over China proper, reigning from 1735 to 1796. Born Hongli, the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, he reigned officially from 11 October 1735 to 8 February 1796. In 1796, he abdicated in favour of his son, the Jiaqing Emperor, out of filial piety towards his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, who ruled for 61 years, so that he would remain the longest-reigning emperor. ==References== Category:1711 births Category:1799 deaths Category:Emperors of Qing Dynasty Category:18th century in China",
