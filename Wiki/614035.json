Originally organized in 1872 from near townships (Jefferson, Leyden and Niles) as a village, and named after Henry Ward Beecher's novel Norwood, or Village Life in New England (1868), Norwood Park was annexed to the City of Chicago in 1893. Norwood Park was incorporated as a village in 1874 and annexed to Chicago on November 7, 1893.https://chicagology.com/wp- content/themes/revolution-20/chicagoimages/annexation1930.jpg Every Memorial Day there is a parade that runs through Norwood Park. The parade has been a local tradition for more than 90 years, starting in 1922. The community area also has the oldest building in Chicago, the Noble-Seymour-Crippen House. Taft High School was completed in 1939, with major additions made in 1959 and 1974. ==References== Category:Community areas of Chicago",
