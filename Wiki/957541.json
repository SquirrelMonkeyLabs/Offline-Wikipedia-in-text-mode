 "text": "The Cuban tree frog, marbled tree toad, or giant tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) is a frog. It lives in Cuba, Isla de Pinos, the Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas. Human beings have brought it to Curacao, Anguilla, Costa Rica Saint Maarten, Saba, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Nevis, Puerto Rico, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and the island of Oahu in Hawaii. This frog is larger than other frogs in Hylidae. The disks on their toes are also very large. There is no webbed skin on their front feet. There is some webbed skin on their back feet. This frog is usually gray or green in color. Sometimes it is brown or light brown instead. The female frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The tadpoles grow fast so they become frogs before the water dries up. The tadpoles have round bodies. The skin on their backs is black in color. Parts of their tails are gray-brown in color. This frog can eat smaller frogs. Because human beings brought it to places where it did not always live, it has become an invasive specie. It eats the frogs that have lived in those places a long time. It makes a chemical in its skin that can harm human skin. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
