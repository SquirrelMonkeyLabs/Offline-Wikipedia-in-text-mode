She was born in Mobile, Alabama, and studied at Georgia Washington University. In 1968, she organized a black arts festival and had inner-city students in to the festival. This program became the magnet school Duke Ellington School of the Arts, which she and Malone founded in 1974 and which they modeled after New York City's High School of Performing Arts. Cafritz died of complications from pneumonia in Washington, D.C. on February 18, 2018 at the age of 70. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Educators from Alabama Category:American civil rights activists Category:American philanthropists Category:Writers from Mobile, Alabama Category:Writers from Washington, D.C.
