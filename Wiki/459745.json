 "text": "The Munchkins are natives of the fictional Munchkin Country in the Oz books by L. Frank Baum. They first appeared in the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, in which they are described as wearing only blue. The 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, showed Munchkins as being much shorter than other residents of Oz. They are played by either adult dwarfs (i.e., midgets) or children, dressed in brightly multicolored outfits, and their land is called Munchkinland. On November 20, 2007, the Munchkins were given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. ==References== Category:Characters in written fiction",
