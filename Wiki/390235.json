 "text": "Abbotsford International Airport is a public airport in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada. It is about 4.1 km (2.5 mi) southwest of Abbotsford's city centre. It is the second-largest airport in the Lower Mainland after Vancouver International Airport. In 2010, it was the nineteenth busiest airport in Canada by aircraft movements (102,128) and passengers (503,693). The airport's IATA code, YXX, may seem unusual at first. However, the code gets its last two letters, XX, from an old railway station code near the airport. Most Canadian airports start with Y, which gives the code YXX. ==References== ==Other websites== * Abbotsford International Airport, official web site Category:Airports in Canada",
