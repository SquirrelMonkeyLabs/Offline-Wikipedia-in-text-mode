 "text": "Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), more commonly known as Ronaldinho, or Ronaldinho Gaúcho, is a retired Brazilian footballer. Considered the best player in world football for several years, he is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, and by some, as the greatest ever. He was known for his dribbling, passing, flair, skills, and ability to create and score goals, all prominent characteristics of his early-age background playing futsal. He is the only player ever to have won a World Cup, a Copa América, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa Libertadores and a Ballon d'Or. At club level, he is best known for playing for F.C. Barcelona (2003-2008). During his career, he was one of the most valuable footballers in the world.https://www.givemesport.com/1731867-ronaldinho- beckham-rooney-who-was-the-most-valuable-footballer- in-2004/https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/most-valuable-players-in-2005-ballack- ahead-of-gerrard-and- kaka/view/news/357293https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/ronaldinho-named- valuable-footballer- beckham/550839https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/31/marketingandpr.sport In 2009, he was voted \"World Player of the Decade 2000s\", ahead of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
