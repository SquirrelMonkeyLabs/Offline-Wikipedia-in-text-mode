 "text": "Law & Order is an American television show and it originally aired on NBC from September 13, 1990 to May 24, 2010. It is a police procedural and legal drama. It's the longest primetime crime drama show in America. Season 0 (Pre-1) (Pilot) could've been aired in 1988. A revival was aired in 2022. Many of the crimes in the episodes were \"ripped from the headlines\", meaning they were based on crimes that really happened. Episodes of the show were usually split into two parts. The first part would show the crime, the police looking for the suspect (the person they think did the crime), and the suspect being arrested. This is the \"Law\" part. The second part, the \"Order\" part, would show the trial and whether or not the suspect did the crime. == Cast == * George Dzundza as Max Greevey * Chris Noth as Mike Logan * Dann Florek as Donald Cragen * Michael Moriarty as Ben Stone * Richard Brooks as Paul Robinette * Steven Hill as Adam Schiff * Paul Sorvino as Phil Cerreta * Jerry Orbach as Lennie Briscoe * Carolyn McCormick as Dr. Elizabeth Olivet * S.
