A wealthy landowner that pioneered Holstein livestock raising in Ecuador. He was the acting President from 12 August 1911 to 1 September 1911 (a reign lasting just 21 days). He took the role on a temporary basis when Eloy Alfaro, who had been President for over 4 years, was overthrown and went to exile. Freile was replaced by the already elected President Emilio Estrada, whose mandate lasted just three months before his death on 21 December 1911. Carlos Freile then served once again as acting president, this time from 22 December 1911 to 6 March 1912. He was again acting president during a crisis and was succeeded by Francisco Andrade Mar√≠n. ==Other websites== * Official Website of the Ecuadorian Government about the country President's History Category:1851 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Presidents of Ecuador",
