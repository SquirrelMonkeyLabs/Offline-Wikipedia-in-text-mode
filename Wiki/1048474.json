In the video, Paul and his crew pull up to a house where a party is taking place. He enters the house and people are dancing in the basement. Paul performs at the party while people hold lighters. They bang on the vents and roof which alerts the homeowner. He goes down and yanks the mic from Paul to tell them to stop banging on the furnace. He leaves, they do it again and he kicks them out. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2003 songs Category:Sean Paul songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number one songs Category:Dancehall songs Category:Reggae songs",
