 "text": "Count nouns are nouns that can be easily be counted. In languages like English, count nouns can be written without having to use any extra measure words. Since the nouns themselves, like \"dog\", \"car\", \"people\", \"book\", etc., are easy to count, the nouns themselves are treated as they were their own measure words. However, in East Asian languages, like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, all nouns, both count and mass nouns, must have measure words. Category:Parts of speech",
