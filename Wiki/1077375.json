 "text": "We the People Party is the name of political third parties in the United States founded in January 2024 by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to help obtain ballot access for his 2024 presidential campaign. Parties with that name have been formed in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, and North Carolina. Additionally, in Texas a party was created under the name Texas Independent Party. The party is seeking to register 75,000 people in California in order to run against presidential candidates in the Republican and Democratic parties. == Purpose == Kennedy, who was also running as an independent politician, created the party to make it easier to obtain ballot access. Independent candidates require large numbers of signatures from voters to get on the ballot in most states. In some states that number is significantly lower for political parties. Registering a new political party in selected states reduces by 330,000 the total signatures needed to obtain ballot access in every state. == Status == === Ballot access === On February 29, 2024, the We the People Party received the necessary number of signatures to obtain ballot access in Hawaii, which was certified by the Hawaii Office of Elections. On April 1, 2024, the Kennedy campaign claimed that they had received enough signatures to obtain ballot access for the We the People Party in North Carolina. This has yet to be certified. On April 28, 2024, Kennedy received the nomination of the American Independent Party, which meant that the We the People Party no longer needed to obtain ballot access in California. On May 7, 2024, Kennedy received the nomination of the Independent Party of Delaware, which meant that the We the People Party no longer needed to obtain ballot access in Delaware. At the time of the nomination, the We the People Party of Delaware only had 175 of the 770 needed registered members. On August 8, 2024, a lawsuit was filed in Pennsylvania \"to set aside the nomination papers of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Nicole Shanahan as the We The People Candidates for President and Vice President of the United States\". === Filing === Kennedy filed paperwork to create the party in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, and North Carolina. Election officials in California, Delaware, Hawaii, and North Carolina confirmed that they had received a filing for the formation of We the People Party affiliates in their states. Jane Nelson, the Secretary of State of Texas, also confirmed that filing for the formation of the Texas Independent Party had been received. Officials in Mississippi claimed they had received no filing. === Registration === To obtain political party status in California, the We the People Party is required to have 75,000 registered members in the state. Delaware requires 770 registered members to obtain political party status. == Related pages == * Justice for All Party * Robert F.
