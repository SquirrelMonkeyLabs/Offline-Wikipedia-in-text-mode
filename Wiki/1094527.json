Walden pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Bowman on November 27, 2018, and was sentenced to 70 years in prison. == Events == Justin and Amy Bowman both worked and brought their two children, Sawyer and Reese, to Rocket Tiers Learning Center in Baltimore, Maryland. The murder of Reese Bowman occurred on May 23, 2017. It was caught on camera and her brother Sawyer was upstairs at the time it occurred. When Leah Walden returned from lunch to Rocket Tiers Learning Center, she found that Reese Bowman would not nap. Walden told a co- worker: \"Girl, I'm frustrated ... I'm sick of this little bitch. I hate this little bitch. ... She makes me want to punch her in the face.\" Walden slapped Reese in the crib, then pinned the infant down with one arm as Reese kicked out her legs in desperation. Walden subsequently put a number of blankets over the child's face and smothered her to death. Baltimore's Criminal Investigations Chief Stanley Bradford said: \"Watching that video is disturbing. Reese Bowman, in my opinion, was tortured.\" == References == Category:2016 births Category:2017 deaths Category:2017 crimes Category:2010s crimes in the United States Category:Murdered children",
