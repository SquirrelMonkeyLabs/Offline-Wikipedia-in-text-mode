 "text": "thumb|right | 200px | Parathyroid glands location Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and all tetrapods, embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid glands.Gray, Henry 1980. Williams, Peter L & Warwick, Roger (eds) Gray's Anatomy (36th ed). Churchill Livingstone p1453. == Function == These glands produce parathyroid hormones (PTH). This has an important role in controlling the amount of calcium in blood and bones. Calcium is an important element in our body: it is the only element with its own control system (the parathyroid glands). == Structure == There are two pairs of parathyroid glands, just behind the thyroid glands. Each gland is about 6 mm long and 3â€“4 mm wide. Parathyroid glands get their blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries.Fehrenbach and Herring 2012. Illustrated Anatomy of the head and neck.
