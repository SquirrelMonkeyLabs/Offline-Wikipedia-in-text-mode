The later history of the Imperial House is sometimes referred to as the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov. The Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who was from a younger branch of the Oldenburgs, married into the Romanov family in the mid-eighteenth century. Though officially known as the House of Romanov, these descendants of the Romanov and Oldenburg Houses are sometimes referred to as Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov. == References ==",
