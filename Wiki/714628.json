 "text": "The Kaskaskia were one of the Native American tribes of the Northeastern Woodlands. They were one of about a dozen cognate tribes that made up the Illiniwek Confederation (also called the Illinois Confederation). They mostly lived in the Great Lakes region. Their first contact with Europeans happened in 1667 near present-day Green Bay, Wisconsin at a Jesuit mission station. The descendants of the Kaskaskia, along with the Wea and Piankeshaw, are in the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma. That means they are a federally recognized tribe in Oklahoma.House, Office of the Law Revision Counsel.
