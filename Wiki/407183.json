 "text": "The tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae) are a clade of passerine birds from the Americas. They are the largest family of birds on Earth, with more than 400 species. They are the most diverse family of birds in every country in South and Central America. They also live in North America. The family is named after the Old World flycatchers. Some members have similar features to the Old World flycatchers, but they are not related to them. They are members of suborder Tyranni. They do not have the song (vocal capabilities) of most other songbirds.del Hoyo, J. Elliott, A. & Christie, D. (editors). (2004) Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 9: Cotingas to Pipits and Wagtails. Lynx Edicions. Tyrant flycatchers are opportunistic feeders and often catch any insect they run across. Some, like the large great kiskadee, may eat fruit or small vertebrates such as frogs. Kingbirds are flycatchers of the genus Tyrannus. They can be quite aggressive in defence of their interests. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Tyrant Flycatcher videos on the Internet Bird Collection * Category:Tyranni",
