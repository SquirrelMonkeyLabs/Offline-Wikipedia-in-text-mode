 "text": "The Sicilian defence, usually called just the Sicilian, is a chess opening, which starts with these moves: *1. e4 c5 In competitive chess, it is by far the most frequently played reply to the King's Pawn opening (1.e4). *Open variations 1e4 c5 2Nf3 followed by 3d4. A typical line is :1.e4 c5 :2.Nf3 d6 :3.d4 cxd4 :4.Nxd4 Nf6 :5.Nc3 Now Black decides where to put his KB: on e7 or g7; his QN will probably go to c6. *Closed variations 1e4 c5 2Nc3 not followed by d4. A typical line is :1.e4 c5 :2.Nc3 Nc6 :3.f4 d6 :4.Nf3 g6 :5.Bb5 Bg7 :6.d3 Instead of 3.f4, a slower game with 3.g3 followed by Bg2 and d3 could be chosen by White. *ECO code B20â€“B99.
