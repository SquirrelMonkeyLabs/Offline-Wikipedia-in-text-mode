 "text": "AmphibiaWeb is an American non-profit website that shows information about amphibians, for example frogs and salamanders. It is run by a group of universities working with the California Academy of Sciences: San Francisco State University, the University of California at Berkeley, University of Florida at Gainesville, and University of Texas at Austin. AmphibiaWeb's goal is to provide an information page for every species of amphibian in the world so research scientists, citizen scientists and people who want to help the environment can work together. It added its 7000th animal in 2012, a glass frog from Peru. As of 2022, it hosted more than 8,400 species from all over the world. ==Beginning== Scientist David Wake founded AmphibiaWeb in 2000. He founded it at the Digital Library Project at the University of California at Berkeley in 2000. It was a class project. ==Uses== AmphibiaWeb gives information to the IUCN, CalPhotos, Encyclopedia of Life and iNaturalist. Professional scientists use AmphibiaWeb in their papers. It has been cited in many journals, for example PLOS One, The European Journal of Taxonomy, Amino Acids and The Journal of Ethnopharmacology. Many libraries recommend AmphibiaWeb to readers, including UNLV University Libraries, Stony Brook University Libraries, the College of Wooster Libraries and James Cook University Libraries. ==Related pages== * Endangered species * Amphibians ==Other websites== *AmphibiaWeb ==References== Category:Scientific organizations based in the United States Category:American science websites Category:Biological databases Category:2000 establishments in the United States",
