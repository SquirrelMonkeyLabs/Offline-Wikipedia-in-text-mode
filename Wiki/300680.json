 "text": "Field Marshal Sir Claude John Eyre Auchinleck, GCB, GCIE, CSI, DSO, OBE (21 June 1884 â€“ 23 March 1981), nicknamed \"The Auk\", was a British army commander during World War II. He was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in India, where he developed a love of the country and a lasting affinity for the soldiers he commanded. In July 1941, he was appointed Commander in Chief of the Middle East theatre. After initial successes, the war in North Africa turned against the British, and he was relieved of the post in 1942, during the crucial El-Alamein campaign. He served thereafter as commander in India until his resignation in 1947. He retired to Marrakesh, where he died at age 96. ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1981 deaths Category:British military personnel of World War II Category:British Indian Army officers",
