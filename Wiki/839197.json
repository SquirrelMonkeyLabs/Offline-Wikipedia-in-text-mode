 "text": "Itadaki Street DS (いただきストリートDS, lit. \"Top Street DS\") is a game for the Nintendo DS. It was created by Square Enix. Like other installments in the Itadaki Street series, Itadaki Street DS is a Monopoly-like game that has some Mario Party-esque elements added to it due to the appearance of several Mario characters (minigames, for example). It was released on June 21, 2007 only in Japan. A follow-up to this game, titled Fortune Street was released for the Wii in December 2011. == Gameplay == Players move around the board, buying shops and collecting money from others who land on their shop spaces. Depending on circumstances, some players can forcibly take over another player's shop spaces, or make them inactive for a turn. Players can also hold shares of a block of spaces so that they get paid when someone lands on any space in that block, even if it is not their own. Players get bonuses for leveling up, which is done by passing four special spaces on the board (each marked with a suit- Club, Diamond, Heart, and Spade) and then going to the Bank space. If the player lands on one of these special spaces instead of passing them, they get a chance to randomly draw a \"chance card\", which affects gameplay or a player. Usually, the goal is to reach a certain total property value and get to the Bank, or to make a player bankrupt. There is also a special \"Casino\" space where themed games of chance occur. == Characters == There are 23 playable characters in Itadaki Street DS (if the male and female avatars are counted as one character): Eleven from the Mario series and eleven from the Dragon Quest series. Players are also able to create and customize their own characters that can be played as. Although only four of the characters from both series are playable to begin with, the others can be unlocked by playing through the Tour Mode of the game. Additionally, there are also three Support/Guest characters that players can summon with the help of a card, but are not playable. Support/Guest Characters Lakitu (shuts down spaces he passes or lands on for one turn) Healslime (gives marks necessary for leveling up when player passes it) Dancing Jewels/GoodyBag (pays out to the owner of any space it lands on) == Trivia == The theme \"Hello, Happy Kingdom\" from Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is featured in this game's tutorial level. This is one of the few games where Mario has written dialogue. == Other websites == * http://www.square-enix.co.jp/itastds/ Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:2007 video games Category:Party video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games",
