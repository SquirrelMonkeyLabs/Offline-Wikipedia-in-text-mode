 "text": "James Albert \"Jimmy\" Creighton (November 18, 1905 — May 29, 1990) was a Canadian ice hockey player and politician from Brandon, Manitoba. Creighton played eleven games in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Falcons in 1931, scoring one goal and receiving one minor penalty. He was traded to the New York Americans in December 1931, but never played for them. He later worked in the International Hockey League and the Can-Am Leagues. Creighton became a pro hockey referee after retiring as a player, and later worked selling insurance. He was alderman in Brandon in 1946, 1948 and 1949, and was mayor of the city from 1952 to 1955 and from 1958 to 1961. Creighton won the Liberal-Progressive nomination for Brandon City in the 1953 provincial election, defeating W.A. Wood and J.C. MacDonald at a contested meeting. He lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Reginald Lissaman in the general election, receiving 3,063 votes (40.13%) on the first count and losing on the second. Provincial elections in Manitoba were conducted by the single transferable ballot in this period. Later in the same year, Creighton ran for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1953 federal election as a Liberal candidate in Brandon—Souris. He received 8,456 votes, and finished second to Progressive Conservative Walter Dinsdale. He ran for the Manitoba legislature a second time in the 1962, and lost to Lissaman again. He got Parkinson's Disease in his later years, and was in a nursing home before dying in 1990. ==Other websites== *LostHockey.com obituaries * * Category:1905 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey forwards Category:Canadian mayors Category:Politicians from Manitoba Category:Detroit Falcons players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Ice hockey people from Brandon, Manitoba",
