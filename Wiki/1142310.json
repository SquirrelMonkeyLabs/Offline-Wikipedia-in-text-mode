 "text": "Parliamentary elections were held in Iceland on 30 November 2024 to elect the 63 members of the Althing. The centre-left Social Democratic Alliance, led by Kristrún Frostadóttir, won the most seats, at 15. The election also saw the worst performance by the Independence Party, Progressive Party, and the Left- Green Movement in each of the parties' histories, while Viðreisn, the People's Party, and the Centre Party saw their vote share increase. ==Background== In April 2024, Bjarni Benediktsson became the Prime Minister of Iceland. On 13 October, Benediktsson announced that the government had collapsed and called for new elections. He asked President Halla Tómasdóttir the next day to dissolve the Althing and set the elections on 30 November. ==Opinion polling== ==Forming== On 3 December 2024, President Halla Tómasdóttir gave Kristrún Frostadóttir the first mandate and expressed interest in trying to form a government with her own party, Viðreisn, and the People's Party. On 4 December, Kristrún Frostadóttir began the formal process of forming a government consisting of Social Democratic Alliance, Viðreisn and the People's Party. If successfully formed, the government would have 36 of the 63 seats in the Althing. The coalition leaders were dubbed as \"valkyries\", citing that the three parties are led by women. ==References== Category:2024 elections in Europe Category:2020s in Iceland Category:November 2024 events",
