 "text": "Lares (pl.)also called Genii loci or, more archaically, Lases were ancient Roman deities who protected the house and the family - household gods. See also Genius, Larvae, Di Penates, Manes. Lares are presumed sons of Mercury and Lara, and deeply venerated by ancient Romans through small statues, usually put in higher places of the house, far from the floor, or even on the roof. In the early Roman times, in every house there was at least one little statue. Later, a sort of confusion connected their figure with those of Manes, deities of Hades (and the most virtuous dead persons of the family). Finally the confusion included the Penates (other minor deities) as well. ==Related pages== * Turan, the Etruscan love goddess == References == Category:Roman gods and goddesses",
