After she begged God for a child, she gave birth to Samuel. Samuel became a prophet of God (a voice for God in Israel). When Samuel was a young child, she took him to live in the temple (as she had promised God), to be an apprentice of Eli the priest. == References == Category:Old Testament people Category:Ancient Israeli people Category:11th-century BC people",
