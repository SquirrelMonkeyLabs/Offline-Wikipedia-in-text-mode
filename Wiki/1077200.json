 "text": "Normalization in statistics simplifies data comparison and understanding. It involves adjusting values to a common scale, enabling fair comparisons. For instance, if we have two sets of numbers with different scales, normalization transforms them to a standard scale such as from 0 to 1. This technique also helps identify patterns or distributions among data sets, like transforming student scores to a bell curve. Additionally, normalization aids in eliminating influences that might affect comparisons, allowing us to focus on overall trends. With normalization, we can make sense of data, draw meaningful conclusions, and simplify analysis. Category:Statistics",
