 "text": "== What is a nebulae == A nebula is either where stars or are formed or a remnant of a star that went supernova. A example of a nebula that makes stars is the Orion nebula (Messieer 42) and an example of a remnant is the crab nebula (Messier 1). == What types of nebulae are there == There are a few types of nebulae types, a few of them are planetary nebulae which are formed when a star like our sun or slightly larger dies, a supernova remnant is the remains of a massive star dies, a emmision nebula is a nebula that consists of ionized gas that emits light of different colours, a dark nebula is a nebula that has dense clouds that block light from behind them, a reflection nebula is a nebula that is made of dust that reflects from nearby stars and a protosteller nebula is where new stars form from collapsing clouds of gas. There are also H II regions which are ionized hydrogen gas which intesne star formation is occouring and there are also wolf-rayet nebulas that contain massive stars that have strong steller winds. == A == Abell 31 Ant nebula Aquilla rift Abell 39 == B == Bubble nebula Butterfly nebula Blue horsehead nebula Barneds loop Boogeyman nebula == C == Cats eye nebula California nebula Cave nebula Crab nebula Cygnus loop Cone nebula Cacoon nebula Christmas tree cluster/nebula Carina nebula == D == Dark Doodad nebula Dumbbell nebula == E == Eagle nebula East viel nebula Elephants trunk nebula Eskimo nebula Eta Carinae nebula == F == Flame nebula Fried Egg nebula False comet nebula Flying ghost nebula == G == Gum nebula Ghost nebulaGhost nebula Gamma cygni nebula Glowing eye nebula == H == Helix nebula Heart nebula Horsehead nebula Hourglass nebula Hidden nebula == I == Iris nebula == J == Jellyfish nebula == K == Kohoutek nebula Kleinman low nebula == L == Lagoon nebula Lemon slice nebula Little dumbbell nebula Lynds dark nebula == M == Medusa nebula == N == North america nebula Ninja nebula == O == Orion nebula Omega nebula == P == Pacman nebula Pencil nebula Prawn nebula Pelican nebula Phanton streak nebula == R == Ring nebula Red rectangle nebula Rosette nebula Running chicken nebula == S == Saturn nebula Sadr region Soul nebula Seagull nebula Southen owl nebula == T == Tadpole nebula Thors helmet nebula Tulip nebula Trifid nebula Tarantula nebula == V == Vela supernova remnant Veil nebula == W == Witch head nebula Wizard nebula Western veil nebula Wolf-Rayet nebulae == Y == Yule log nebula Category:Nebulae",
