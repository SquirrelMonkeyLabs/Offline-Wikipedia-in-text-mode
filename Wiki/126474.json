 "text": "The Chicago Spire was a skyscraper project that was being built in Chicago, Illinois, however, because of financial problems, the project was never finished. It would have stood high with 150 floors and been the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. When originally proposed as the Fordham Spire in July 2005, the design had 116 stories, included a hotel and condominiums, and was topped with a broadcast antenna mast. However, interest in the Chicago Spire site has risen, drawing in at least a half-dozen offers for the property. The developer was considering a bid to take back control of the property, reigniting hope that the 2,000 ft. skyscraper may actually be built. In 2014, a Chicago court ruled in favor of not building the skyscraper thus abandoning plans of it being constructed. On 4 November 2016, ownership of the property the tower was being built on was given to Related Midwest. In 2018, it was revealed that Related Midwest will build two skyscrapers at the site of the Spire. The Gateway Tower, a proposed tall condo, is proposed to be built on the site of where the Spire would have been built. ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in Chicago Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States",
