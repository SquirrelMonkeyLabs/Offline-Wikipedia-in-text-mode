It also teaches girls to be leaders. == Childhood and Family == Bryant grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Bryant wanted to work as a lawyer until she discovered computer science. Her brother taught her about computer science. Years later, she noticed her daughter loved to play video games. She enrolled her daughter in a computer science camp at Stanford. Her daughter was very upset from the camp. The camp was all boys, so her daughter felt alone. Bryant wanted to change girls' experience with learning about computers. ==Accomplishments == Bryant helps women of color to be more involved in STEM. Black Girls Code started in a basement in San Francisco. Now, Black Girls Code teaches 3,000 girls and uses 1,300 volunteers. They have 13 chapters in the U.S., as well as one in South Africa. == References == Category:Living people Category:People from California Category:1967 births",
