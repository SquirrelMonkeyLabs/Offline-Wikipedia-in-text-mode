 "text": "Cooch Behar (1586â€”1949; also spelled Koch Bihar) was a small kingdom located south of the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, west of the upper Brahmaputra valley Ahom Kingdom, and north-east of the Ganges plain and Bengal. Until 1949, Cooch Behar was a princely state subject to British rule. In 1949, it was merged with India; now free from the British. It later became a part of West Bengal. However, if Cooch Behar had become part of East Pakistan, then India would not have had as much land access towards the north-east. Also the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) would have land borders with Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim.
