 "text": "The Edmonton Elks, formerly known as the Edmonton Eskimos and briefly as Edmonton Football Team, are a professional Canadian football team. They are based in Edmonton, Alberta. The team plays home games at Commonwealth Stadium. It is part of the West Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). It was started in 1949. The team has won the league's Grey Cup thirteen times. Only one team has won the cup more often. In the 21st century, the team nickname caused major controversy because the term \"Eskimo\" is now considered a slur by the Inuit, the indigenous people of Arctic Canada. The team dropped the \"Eskimos\" name on July 21, 2020, using \"Edmonton Football Team\" as a placeholder name while a new nickname was chosen. The new name of Elks was announced on June 1, 2021. ==References== Category:Canadian football clubs Elks Category:1949 establishments in Canada",
