 "text": "Danganronpa is a mystery action visual novel video game series. It was developed by Spike Chunsoft Co Ltd (previously Spike Co Ltd) as a beta named DISTRUST. DISTRUST was cancelled due to the story being too dark and the setting was not usable for high school students. Two animated shows were released: Danganronpa: The Animation and Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School. ==Story== === Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc/Danganronpa: The Animation === Makoto Naegi and 15 other talented students enter a high school for highly skilled students named Hope's Peak Academy. In the game, Makoto Naegi enters the school building before fainting and waking up in a classroom. While in the animation, Makoto steps foot onto the school and immediately falls unconscious. He then goes to the gym to meet fifteen other high school students who joined Hope's Peak Academy. After the introductions, a robotic bear named Monokuma introduces himself and states that they are trapped in the school. The only way to escape is to commit murder without getting caught by the other students. For the rest of the game/animation, Makoto and his classmates are to find the murderers. If they do not find the murderer they will be executed, if they do find the murderer, only the murderer will be executed. === Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair === Hajime Hinata and 15 other students join an academy. When Hajime enters the academy he walks into a room that is filled with binary code and a door. When he walks through the door, he enters a classroom filled with fifteen other students. They all introduce themselves. A robotic rabbit named Usami/Monomi/Magical Girl Usami appears and introduces herself as their teacher. After her introduction, she gets a magical wand and twirls it around, the ceiling and walls rip off to show a paradise beach. Afterwards on a beach, she asks them to earn 15 Friendship Fragments. Afterwards, Usami asks everyone to come back to the beach, but a random storm shows up and a silhouette of Monokuma appears on a monitor. The silhouette asks the students to meet at a place on the island named Central Park. Monokuma introduces himself on the statue in Central Park and begins the killing game. He tells them the only way to escape the island successfully is to kill another student without getting caught by the other students. For the rest of the game, Hajime and his classmates attempt to debunk the mysteries and catch the murderers. === Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls === Komaru Naegi and Toko Fukawa (from the first game) attempt to save the world from dangerous Monokuma robots. The events of this game take place between the second and first game, during the Despair event that seemed to kill off most of humanity. Komaru Naegi, Makoto Naegi's sister, has been trapped inside an apartment with no connection to the outside world for a year. Every day, she goes to the exit door but it seems to be locked from outside. However, one day, food was delivered to her and she banged on the door in an attempt to escape, as usual. A hostile Monokuma robot with sharp claws goes to attack her, chasing her across the locked apartment and the apartment building. She races to an elevator, which contains Byakuya Togami. He gives her a hacking gun, designed as a megaphone, and tells her to run to a nearby restaurant and find a member of the Future Foundation. Hostile Monokuma robots enter the restaurant and start attacking the customers, killing many of them. Afterwards, Komaru finds a Future Foundation member and they guide her to go to a helicopter. When she gets to the helicopter, she sees a kid wearing a Monokuma head singing. She gets onto the helicopter but a Monokuma robot tries to enter. After she solves this, another issue begins. A Monokuma robot was up front tinkering with the helicopter controls and drives them up into the sky. Her first failed execution begins, as she flies into the sky. The helicopter crashes, with Komaru surviving with minor damage to her body. A Monokuma robot appears in front of her, as more appear. She faints and wakes up in a room. The Ultimate Servant, Nagito Komaeda, enters the room and asks if she could come to the main room. When she enters, five children introduce themselves as the Lil' Ultimate's. They also introduce a new type of killing game named Demon Hunting where the Lil Ultimate's had a target hitlist. It was their objective to kill all adults and make it a kids only place. Komaru's second failed execution begins, as she falls down a hole with a parachute. Again, she survives with minor injuries. After this, she meets Toko Fukawa and her alternate self, Genocide Jill/Jack. For the rest of the game, they go on a mission to defeat the Lil' Ultimates together, and save the city from the evil Monokuma robots. === Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak Academy === This animation has three seasons. ==== Despair Arc ==== Takes place before the events of Trigger Happy Havoc. A new teacher treats the Danganronpa 2 students. Chisa Yukizome is a substitute teacher before she becomes an actual teacher at Hope's Peak Academy. In the first episode, most of the class is missing so the class that is present in the classroom and Chisa go to find all the students. As the show progresses the episode's get darker. On the final few episodes, Junko Enoshima brainwashes Chisa Yukizome, gives Chiaki Nanami false hope and death, and brainwashes all the students into committing despair-like actions. ==== Future Arc ==== Takes place after the events of Goodbye Despair. Older Makoto Naegi, Aoi Asahina, Kyoko/Kyouko Kirigiri, and a few others are trapped inside the Future Foundation building. The objective of this killing game is similar to the normal Danganronpa style, however there is only one killer. Everyone is given a wristband with a forbidden action and a timer. If the wristband wearer commits the forbidden action a poison will be put inside of them and make them bleed out of their eyes. It will also turn a part of the skin black and kill them. Once the timer ends a gas will be put everywhere in the building in put them to sleep. On the final episode, the show is put on a cliff hanger. ==== Hope Arc ==== Takes place after the events of Goodbye Despair. Makoto Naegi is tasked to stop Ryota Mitarai from sending a brainwashing video (using his brainwashing technique) to the entire world which is supposed to fill them with hope. This season is only one episode long. At the end of the episode, Makoto Naegi rebuilds Hope's Peak Academy and becomes the new principal. This marks the end of Hope's Peak Academy. === Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony === Kaede Akamatsu and her classmates join a new academy, \"The Ultimate School for Gifted Juveniles\". Kaede introduces herself and walks out of a locker she was asleep in. She explores the classroom a bit. A detective named Shuichi Saihara falls out of a locker and begins to freak out. They both introduce themselves and tell each other how they arrived. They leave the classroom to be seen by giant mechs named Exisals, which chase them to the gym. When they enter they see 14 other students. 5 smaller versions of Monokuma appear named the Monokubs. They introduce themselves and give everyone new clothes to put on. Afterwards, a flashlight is used to erase their memory of the event and the beginning happens all over again. They all go back to the gym to find Monokuma.

Each chapter has 3 main parts - Daily Life, Deadly Life, and the Class Trial. === Daily Life === Each chapter begins with Daily Life. During Daily Life, the player can walk around the school and talk to other characters. They can also find \"Monocoins\", the game's currency. These coins can be used to buy items from the school store. At some points in the game, the player is given \"Free Time\", which allows them to speak to other characters in \"Free Time Events\". Each Free Time Event is a small conversation between the player and another character. The player can choose to give one of the items they have bought to start a Free Time Event. In these conversations, players can learn more about a character and their backstory. Players can also skip Free Time Events by going to sleep in their dormitory. === Deadly Life === Once another character is killed, Deadly Life begins. During Deadly Life, the player must investigate and find clues. They can find clues by looking around the crime scene and speaking to other students. === Class Trial === After the player has found enough clues, the Class Trial will begin. The Class Trial is a mock trial where the students have to figure out who the killer is. The player uses the clues they have found to help figure out who the killer is in a number of minigames. At the end of the class trial, Monokuma will punish the student with an execution that follows their talent. * Non-Stop Debate: In this minigame, some of the player's clues appear as \"Truth Bullets\". Many characters talk about part of the murder case. As they speak, their words are shown on the screen. Some of their words are colored in orange. These are called \"Weak Points\". The player has to find the right Truth Bullet and \"shoot\" it at the correct Weak Point, by seeing which of their clues does not support a character's statement. Some games have different mechanics for the Non-Stop Debate. For example, in Goodbye Despair, there are also blue \"Agree Points\", which the player can use with evidence that supports a character's statement. In Killing Harmony, the player may turn any of their Truth Bullets into \"Lie Bullets\" in a mechanic called \"Perjury\". When using a Lie Bullet, the player will lie about their evidence in order to convince the other characters. * Hangman's Gambit: In this minigame, many letters are shown on the screen. The player must find the right letters to spell out an important clue. * Bullet Time Battle (called Panic Talk Action in Goodbye Despair and Argument Armament in Killing Harmony): In this minigame, the player is given a small rhythm game. They must press a button in time with the beat in order to argue with another character. * Rebuttal Showdown (Goodbye Despair and Killing Harmony only): In this minigame, one character argues with the player. Their words are shown in a similar way to the Non-Stop Debate. The player can \"cut\" their words with \"Truth Blades\", a different version of Truth Bullets. * Logic Dive (Goodbye Despair only): In this minigame, the player rides a snowboard through various obstacles. Sometimes, the path in front of the player will split. Each path has an answer above it. The player must choose the right answer to continue with the case. * Mass Panic Debate (Killing Harmony only): In this minigame, the player must play three Non-Stop Debates at once. The player must listen carefully to find the right Weak Point. * Psyche Taxi (Killing Harmony only): In this minigame, the player must drive along a road, collecting boxes which spell out a question. The player must then drive up to a passenger with the correct answer. * Mind Mine (Killing Harmony only): In this minigame, the player must break blocks to reveal images of clues. They must break the blocks to reveal the correct clue before they run out of time. * Scrum Debate (Killing Harmony only): In this minigame, the characters are split into two groups based on two answers to a question. Whenever the other group makes a statement, the player must choose the right person on their team to respond to the statement. * Closing Argument: At the end of the Class Trial, the player is given a small comic book with missing panels. The player must select the right panels to complete the story and prove how the killer committed the murder. == References == Category:2013 television series debuts Category:Detective video games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Video game series",
