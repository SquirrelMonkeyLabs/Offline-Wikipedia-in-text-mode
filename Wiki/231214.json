 "text": "There are many types of matches in professional wrestling. == Singles match == A singles match, also known as a regular match, is between two wrestlers. The first person to either win by pinfall or submission is the winner. If one of the wrestlers gets disqualified, or \"counted out\" (when a wrestler is caught outside of the ring and the referee counts to either 10 or 20, depending on the company's rules), they will lose the match. A championship normally cannot change hands via disqualification or countout. == Cinematic match == A Cinematic match is where there are many different techniques during the filming of it. Unlike a usual match which is done in one take, a cinematic match is typically filmed over a longer period of time. This type of match became more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. == Empty Arena match == An Empty arena match is a falls count anywhere match where the wrestlers start the match inside the ring in an arena that has no fans in it and can only end by pinfall or submission inside or outside of the arena. The only people that are present in the arena are the wrestlers, referee, and the camera crew. One of the first known empty arenas matches took place in 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee between Terry Funk and Jerry Lawler. Another well known empty arena match happened between The Rock and Mankind and was shown on Halftime Heat during the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999. == Falls Count Anywhere match == A Falls Count Anywhere match is a match type where pinfalls or submissions can happen anywhere inside or outside of the arena. Weapons are legal and often used because there are no disqualifications. These types of matches often go into the audience, backstage areas or parking lots. == Flag match == A Flag match is where flags representing two different countries are placed in neutral corners raised up by a metal pole that is attached to the ring post. To win the match, either wrestler or team of wrestlers must grab their country's flag before the opposition does and raise it to be declared the winner. The only exception to these rules was the flag match that took place at WrestleMania 2 in which the match had to be won by pinfall or submission with the winner of the match getting to wave around their country's flag. == Handicap match == A Handicap match is where one wrestler or a team competes against a team of wrestlers with a higher number (for example; two vs. one or three vs. two) Usually it is the babyface wrestlers that are outnumbered by the heel wrestlers. Usually in two-on-one Handicap matches, the matches are under tag team rules (The side that has the advantage must tag in and out of the match or risk being disqualified). If both wrestlers on the side with the advantage remain inside the ring at the same time and the referee reaches a count of five, the team or just the illegal wrestler (if elimination rules apply), with the advantage will be disqualified. == Hardcore-type matches == A hardcore match (also known as a Street Fight, a No Holds Barred match, or other names) is where there are no disqualifications and no countouts. Weapons are allowed to be used and other wrestlers are allowed to interfere in the match. The match must end by pinfall, submission or knockout. An Unsanctioned match is a match that has no rules and is not recognized as an official match. There is also a version called a Lights Out match where the lights in the arena are dimmed. A Deathmatch is where there are multiple different weapons used. Popular weapons used are fluorescent light tubes and barbed wire. These matches are usually very bloody and have a high level of violence in them. A Barbed Wire Ring Rope match is where wrestlers compete in a ring where the regular ring ropes have been replaced with barbed wire. Sometimes the barbed wire is wrapped around the ring ropes. An Explosion or Bomb Deathmatch is a type of Deathmatch where there are barbed wire ropes and a piece of wooden board with an explosive on it. Sometimes there is a timer which counts down and when it hits 00:00, explosives go off around the ring. The match can either be won by pinfall, submission, or in some cases, throwing the other wrestler into the explosion. For the timer version, wrestlers usually try to finish the match before the timer runs out and the ring explodes. An Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch was done by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) during their Revolution pay-per-view. It was held between Kenny Omega and Jon Moxley for Omega's AEW World Championship. There was a 30-minute timer, barbed wire ropes and three sections around the ringside with explosives. == Monster's Ball match == A Monster's Ball match is where the wrestlers are locked inside of a pitch black room for 24 hours with no food or water beforehand. When they are let out, they wrestle a No Disqualification match. == Lumberjack match == A Lumberjack match is a regular match where the outside of the ring is surrounded by wrestlers. The wrestlers that surround the ring are called lumberjacks (females wrestlers are sometimes called lumberjills). If a wrestler is knocked out of the ring, the lumberjacks/lumberjills will beat him or her up and put them back in. They are usually split in groups of faces and heels. == Casino Battle Royal == The Casino Battle Royal is a match done by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). The match has similar rules to the Royal Rumble match except it has 21 wrestlers in it. The wrestlers are selected by a suit of cards that they draw. The drawing of the cards is random and the wrestlers come out when the suit is chosen. The last wrestler that comes out is the wrestler who drew The Joker card. The match begins with 5 wrestlers. 5 more wrestlers come out when the clock hits 3 minutes. The winner of the men's version gets a shot at the AEW World Championship and the winner of the women's version gets a shot at the AEW Women's World Championship. == Bra and Panties match == A bra and panties match is where a female wrestler or team of wrestlers must strip their opponent(s) to their bra and panties to win. == Tuxedo match == A Tuxedo match is where two wrestlers wear tuxedos and one wrestlers has to tear the tuxedo off of the other to win. == Submission match == A Submission match is where the wrestler has to make the other wrestler give up by tapping out.

Female wrestlers used to fight in matches such as a mud wrestling match or chocolate pudding match. At All Out, Orange Cassidy defeated Chris Jericho in a Mimosa Mayhem Match by throwing him in a giant vat of Mimosa that was at ringside. == Multi-person matches == An Elimination match is where a wrestler must pin or submit the other wrestlers to eliminate them from the match. The match differs depending on how many wrestlers are in the match. A Tag Team match is between four wrestlers divided into teams of two. One wrestler of each team stands just outside the ring ropes until they are tagged in by their partner by slapping hands/lightly slapping their partners back with the ref watching or both wrestlers can fight at the same time in a \"tornado\" format. This match is won by pinfall or submission. A Tornado Tag Team match is where all the wrestlers can be in the ring at the same time. The match doesn't involve tagging in or out like the rules of a normal tag team match. All Elite Wrestling (AEW) has a version of this match called the Anarchy in the Arena match. An Elimination Tag Team match is where if a wrestler on a team gets pinned or submitted then they are eliminated from the match. To win the match, all wrestlers from a team must be eliminated. WWE held a similar match called the Survivor Series Elimination match during their Survivor Series pay-per-views. A Three-Way match (also known as a Triple Threat match in WWE, Triangle match in WCW and Three-Way Dance in ECW) has three wrestlers instead of two. The first wrestler to score a pinfall or submission wins. No disqualification or countouts apply. A Four-Way match (known as a Fatal Four-Way in WWE, Four Corners match in WCW and Four-Way Dance in ECW) includes four wrestlers competing against each other at once. The first wrestler scores a pinfall or submission is the winner. No disqualification or countouts apply. A Five-Way match (known as a Fatal Five-Way in WWE) has five wrestlers, and a Six-Way match (known as a Six-Pack Challenge in WWE) has six. In a Championship Scramble Match none of the wrestlers are eliminated. Two wrestlers start the match and every five minutes another wrestler enters until all five participants are present. After the last wrestler enters, there is a predetermined time limit. Each time a wrestler scores a pinfall or submission, they become the interim champion. Such reigns are not recorded as title reigns. The winner is the wrestler who scores the last pinfall or submission before the time limit expires. WWE featured the match in the late 2000s. The Unforgiven pay-per view in 2008 is the most well-known event with this match type, as all three world titles were contested under a Championship Scramble match. A Special Guest Referee match is a match where another wrestler acts as the referee in the match. The referee doesn't have to be a wrestler and can sometimes be an authority figure or celebrity. The Iron Survivor Challenge is held by WWE NXT at their yearly event Deadline. In this 25-minute non-elimination match, five wrestlers compete with two starting. Every five minutes, another wrestler enters. Each pinfall, submission, or being the victim of a disqualification, gives a wrestler a point. A wrestler who is pinned, submitted, or disqualified goes into a penalty box for 90 seconds, after which they can re-enter the match. Whoever has the most points after the time has run out, wins the match and is called the Iron Survivor. The sudden death rule applies in the case of a tie. == Non-Wrestling matches == An Arm Wrestling match is a \"match\" (moreso a contest) where two wrestlers arm wrestle each other. It usually ends with one wrestler attacking the other after. A Boxing match is a match where usual boxing rules are in place. It usually ends in cheating from the heel. == First Blood match == A First Blood match is a match where there are no disqualifications. To win the match, a wrestler must make their opponent bleed. == No Disqualification match == A No Disqualification match (also known as a No Holds Barred match) is a match where there are no disqualifications.

It is usually held in a series of five or seven. To win a Best of Five, the wrestler or team must win three matches. To win a Best of Seven, the wrestler or team must win four matches. A Gauntlet match is where a wrestler must defeat a number of opponents in order to win. Standard rules apply. An Iron Man match is a multi-fall match where there is a set time limit. The way to win the match is to have the most points by the end of the time limit. To gain a point, the wrestler must pin or submit their opponent. A point can also be gained by countout or disqualification. If both wrestlers have the same amount of points as the time limit expires, the match is supposed to be declared a draw, but sometimes they will go to \"sudden death\" rules. (first wrestler to gain a point after the regulation time has expired will gain the victory). Sometimes the \"ultimate submission\" stipulation is also used as well. A Two out of Three falls match is where a wrestler or team has to win twice to win the match. They can win by either pinfall, submission, disqualification, or knockout. A Three Stages of Hell match is a three match series where the wrestler is allowed to pick any three match types. The first wrestler that score two out of three falls declares the winner. == Stipulation matches == A Kiss My Foot match is a type of singles match where the loser has to kiss the winner's foot. Known matches include Bret Hart vs Jerry Lawler at the King of the Ring pay per view held in 1995 as well as Jerry Lawler vs Michael Cole at the Over the Limit pay per view held in 2011. A similar version of this match is the \"Kiss My Ass Match\", where the loser had to kiss the winner's butt and was held during WWF's Attitude Era. A Last Chance match is where a wrestler challenges for a championship. If they lose the match, they are not allowed to challenge the title holder for the championship again. A Loser Leaves Town match is where if the wrestler loses, they have to leave the company. This match was popular during the days of the wrestling territories in the 1980s. Luchas de Apuestas (gambling fights) are matches where both of the wrestlers put something on the line, usually their mask or hair. The loser of the match would then lose the thing that they put on the line. A masked wrestler would be forced to unmask and a wrestler that put their hair on the line would be shaven bald. This type of match is popular in Mexico. A Move match is where a specific wrestling move must be used by a wrestler to win the match. The move depends on the wrestlers in the match or the storyline going into it. There is also a match called a Banned Move match where a specific move will be banned in the match, usually one of the wrestler's finishing moves. If the wrestler uses the move, they will be disqualified. A Retirement match is where if the wrestler loses they have to retire from professional wrestling. == Royal Rumble match == A Royal Rumble match is a multi-person battle royal with an interval time. Only two wrestlers will start the match with the #1 and #2 draw. After some time (usually every 90 seconds) the next wrestler enters the ring. Eliminations only count when a wrestler goes over the top rope with both feet touching the floor. The last wrestler remaining is the winner. This match was created by Pat Patterson. == Ambulance match == An Ambulance match is fought under hardcore rules; the only way to win is for a wrestler to force their opponent into the back of an ambulance and close the door. == Steel Cage match == A steel cage match takes place in a steel cage which surrounds the ring. A wrestler can win by pinfall, submission or escaping the cage by climbing over with both feet hitting the floor outside or by exiting the door with both feet hitting the floor. == Fight Pit match == A Fight Pit match is a variation of a cage match, which can only be won by submission or knockout either by making the opponent unable to stand up at a 10-count or via technical knockout. This makes the match somewhat of a mix of a professional wrestling match and a mixed martial arts fight, as MMA fights can only be won in those ways. == Elimination Chamber match == An Elimination Chamber match takes place in a large, circular steel cage that surrounds the entire ring. The chamber contains four clear, plexiglass pods which holds four of the six wrestlers in the match. A pod opens every five minutes to let another wrestler into the match. A wrestler can be eliminated from the match by either pinfall or submission inside the ring. The last wrestler remaining is the winner. The match was created by Triple H and was introduced by Eric Bischoff in November 2002. == Hell in a Cell match == A Hell in a Cell match takes place in a large cage which covers beyond the ring apron is lowered around the ring and leaves a small gap between the edge of the ring and the cage wall. It also covers the top of the cage hence the name 'cell'. There is no disqualification and wrestlers are allowed to go outside the cell. The match can be won by pinfall or submission. During the early Hell in a Cell matches, many wrestlers got injured. A famous moment happened in 1998 at King of the Ring when The Undertaker threw Mankind off the 16-foot (5 m) high cell through the Spanish announcers table. Undertaker also chokeslammed Mankind through the roof of the cell onto a thumbtack-covered mat in the same match. == Lethal Lockdown match == A Lethal Lockdown match is a steel cage match where two teams face each other and each member of the teams enter similar to the rules of the WarGames match.

Multiple weapons are given and hung from the roof. == Lion's Den match == A Lion's Den match takes place in a octagon cage similar to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). The wrestler must knockout or submit the other wrestler to win the match. The first Lion's Den match took place between Ken Shamrock and Owen Hart at SummerSlam. == Punjabi Prison Match == The Punjabi Prison is one of the unique structures in pro-wrestling. The goal of the match for a wrestler is to escape the two bamboo cages before their opponent does. The Punjabi Prison Match, is a relatively obscure match stipulation — there have only been three in WWE history, The first was The Undertaker vs The Big Show, The Great Khali was originally supposed to be involved in the Big Show’s place but he was forced out of the match after elevated levels of enzymes were found in his liver. The Big Show took Khali’s place and faced off against the Undertaker at the Great American Bash in 2006. Undertaker’s feet ended up hitting the floor first, which gave him the victory. The modern WWE Universe is probably only familiar with the bout as a curiosity coined by The Great Khali, but that doesn’t entirely do justice to the intricacies of the stipulation, or just how brutal the match itself really is. For starters, while matches like a Steel Cage, Hell in a Cell or even the Elimination Chamber typically trap a Superstar within one enclave, the Punjabi Prison surrounds them with two: First, there are four walls of bamboo that immediately surround the ring in the fashion of a traditional cage. Outside of that stands another, larger, octagonal structure, topped with a series of razor-sharp bamboo spikes. == WarGames match == A WarGames match is where there are two rings beside each other and a steel cage surrounding them. Depending on which promotion is doing the match, there is sometimes a roof on the cage. Two teams are locked in the cage and fight. The match starts as a one-on-one match and after five minutes, a new member enters. Every two minutes, a new member of each team enters. The version of WarGames in Jim Crockett Productions and All Elite Wrestling (AEW) have a roof and no pinfalls. AEW's version of WarGames is called Blood and Guts. Dusty Rhodes is credited as the creator of the match. == Inferno match == An Inferno match is where the ring is completely surrounded by flames when both of the wrestler have entered the ring. The way to win the match is for a wrestler to set their opponent on fire. The match usually ends on the outside so that the paramedics can help the loser of the match. The first inferno match took place at Unforgiven in 1998 where The Undertaker defeated Kane. == Buried Alive match == A Buried alive match is where there is a grave dug out of dirt found outside the ring. The way to win the match is for a wrestler to throw their opponent into the grave and bury them in dirt. == Casket match == A casket match, also known as a Coffin match, is where there is a casket near the ring. To win the match, the wrestler has to throw their opponent in the casket and close the lid. This match type was made famous by Undertaker, who competed in 17 of them. == Last Ride match == A Last Ride match is where a wrestler has to throw the other wrestler into the back of a hearse and close it to win.

The first Stadium Stampede match took place at TIAA Bank Field, home of the Jacksonville Jaguars (which is also owned by AEW owner Tony Khan). == Survivor Series Elimination match == In WWE, these matches were primarily featured during its Survivor Series pay-per-views, where they were billed as a \"Survivor Series match\". Teams of four or five, though on some occasions as many as seven, competed under elimination rules. All other standard rules applied, and team members were able to tag in and out in any order. While some teams were already established stables, others needed to recruit members for their team. Since 2022, the match type is no longer featured in WWE, as Survivor Series is now based around WarGames. == Weapons match == A Chairs match is where the only weapon that is allowed to be used is a steel chair. There are no disqualifications in the match. The wrestler can win by either pinfall or submission. A Item on a Pole match is where a wrestler has to climb the turnbuckle and obtain the item in order to win. There are no pinfalls, no submissions, no disqualification, or no countouts.

The wrestler that got either pinned or submitted has to sit in a penalty box at ringside for two minutes. To win the match, the wrestler has to hang an object (usually a championship) on the hook above the ring. The first Queen of the Mountain match took place at Slammiversary in 2022. In a Tables match a wrestler must put their opponent through a table with an offensive move in order to win. The match can also be used in tag teams, under an elimination match and during a one \"fall\" rules match. There is also a hardcore version where the wrestler must put the opponent through a table that has been set on fire. A tables, ladders and chairs match (abbreviated to TLC) is a match where tables, ladders and steel chairs can be used as weapons. The first TLC match took place at SummerSlam in 2000 between Edge and Christian, The Dudley Boyz, and The Hardy Boyz.
