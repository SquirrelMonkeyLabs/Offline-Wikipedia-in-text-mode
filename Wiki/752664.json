 "text": "Gobowen is a village in the ceremonial county of Shropshire, England. It is situated around 3 miles north of the town of Oswestry. The population of the village in 2011 was 3,270. The village was previously called Bryn-y-Castell (\"Hill of the Castle\" in English). The name changed to Gobowen, this name is believed to originate from Gob (a pillow) and Owen (Owain Glynd≈µr) who was believed to have rested here. The village's population grew up around the railway. The mainline route between Chester and Shrewsbury was built through Gobowen after permission was denied to build it through nearby Oswestry. Gobowen railway station is a Grade II listed building. Today, the station provides direct trains to North Wales, Chester, Shrewsbury, Birmingham and South Wales. ==Gallery== File:Milestone_on_the_route_of_the_old_A5_-_geograph.org.uk_-_189281.jpg|A milestone on the route of the old A5 road File:Cross_Foxes_pub,_Gobowen_(geograph_4024017).jpg|Cross Foxes public house, Gobowen File:Ticket_office,_Gobowen_railway_station_(geograph_4024060).jpg|Gobowen station Category:Villages in Shropshire",
