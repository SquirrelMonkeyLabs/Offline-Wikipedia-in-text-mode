 "text": "Birria is a regional variation of barbacoa from western Mexico, mainly made with goat, beef or lamb. The meat is marinated in an adobo made of vinegar, dried chiles, garlic, and herbs and spices (including cumin, bay leaves, and thyme) before being cooked in a broth (Spanish: consomé). Originally, birria was the regional name given in the state of Jalisco and surrounding areas to meats cooked or roasted in a pit or earth oven, what is known as barbacoa in other regions of Mexico, but for many people today, mostly in the United States, birria is now a distinct dish. It is often served at celebratory occasions such as weddings, baptisms and during holidays such as Christmas and Easter, and even at funerals. Preparation techniques vary, but the dish is often served with corn tortillas, onions, cilantro, and lime. Birria is also served with tacos. Restaurants or street carts that serve birria are known as birrierías and exist throughout Mexico, especially in Michoacán and Jalisco. However, neighboring Mexican states have their own variations of the dish, including Aguascalientes, Zacatecas, and Colima. ==Related pages== *Quesabirria *Al pastor *Pozole *Champurrado *Pozol *Chilaquiles *Duros *Tostilocos *Gumbo *Huachinango a la Veracruzana *Arroz a la tumbada *Ibarra Category:Mexican food",
