It opened in 1963 in Lax√•, Sweden, and was popular because people were traveling more by car. The chain grew to 59 hotels in Europe by 1972. Esso then sold the hotels outside of Scandinavia, and the remaining 32 hotels, including five in Norway and Denmark, became the biggest hotel chain in Sweden in 1973. In 1983, a Swedish group led by Ratos bought the company and named it Scandic Hotels. Ratos became the sole owner in 1985. In 1986, they opened their first hotel outside Scandinavia in Germany. During the Gulf Crisis in 1990/91, the business was affected, and new management took over in 1992. In 1996, they bought Reso Hotels and became a publicly traded company. They expanded into Finland and Estonia in the following years. In 2001, Scandic Hotels was bought by the Hilton Group, which is based in London.
