 "text": "Mystikal (Michael Lawrence Tyler) is an American rapper and actor known for his energetic, raspy vocal delivery and Southern rap style. Born on September 22, 1970, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Mystikal began his career in the early 1990s and became one of the most prominent figures in the Southern hip-hop scene, particularly through his association with Master P's No Limit Records. == Early Career and Rise to Fame == Mystikal released his debut self-titled album in 1994 under Big Boy Records. However, his breakthrough came with his 1995 album, Mind of Mystikal, which was re-released after he signed with Jive Records. His success grew after joining No Limit Records, where albums like Unpredictable (1997) and Ghetto Fabulous (1998) brought him mainstream attention. His 2000 album Let’s Get Ready topped the Billboard 200 and included his biggest hit, \"Shake Ya Ass,\" which earned him commercial success. Another notable album, Tarantula (2001), received Grammy nominations and was certified platinum. === Legal Troubles and Hiatus === Mystikal’s career has been marked by significant legal challenges. In 2004, he was sentenced to six years in prison for sexual battery and extortion. After his release in 2010, he made a comeback with new music, but his career was again interrupted by additional legal issues, including a 2017 arrest on charges of first-degree rape and second-degree kidnapping, for which he was released on bail in 2019. ==References== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from New Orleans Category:Gangsta rappers Category:Rappers from Louisiana Category:20th-century American rappers Category:21st-century American actors Category:Actors from New Orleans Category:African-American rappers Category:Hardcore hip hop artists",
