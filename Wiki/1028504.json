 "text": "The Luther Brannon House was a stone bungalow building in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It was one of the few buildings from before World War II that were still in the area. The house was built in 1941. It was taken by the U.S. Army for the Manhattan Project a few months later.National Register of Historic Places nomination form (archive.org copy) It was one of about 180 buildings that were not destroyed after the area was taken for the Manhattan Project. The house is believed to have been used as headquarters for local project operations and a house for General Leslie Groves until the Army finished building new administration buildings.Ask Incky , The Oak Ridger, May 9, 2001 After the war, when most other pre-war buildings in Oak Ridge were torn down, the house was not torn down. As of 1991, it was one of only three pre-World War II houses left in Oak Ridge. The others were Freels Cabin and the J. B. Jones House., National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation Form, July 1991. Section F, pages 2-3. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because it was related to the early development of Oak Ridge. The house was badly damaged by a fire in July 2014. As of April 2020, the fire damage still had not been repaired, and the property was listed for sale. As of February 2021, the house had been demolished. It was removed from the National Register of Historic Places in October 2021. ==References== Category:Anderson County, Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places",
