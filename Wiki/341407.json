 "text": "Gary Leah Thomasson (born July 29, 1951 in San Diego, California) is a former professional baseball player. He played as an outfielder and first baseman in Major League Baseball from 1972 to 1980 and in Japanese Nippon Pro Baseball from 1981 to 1982. Thomasson got a lot of attention when he joined the Yomiuri Giants. He got the largest contract ever in the Nippon league. Then, Thomasson played poorly in his two years in Japan. He almost set the league record for strikeouts. He ended his career with a knee injury. == Cultural references == Japanese artist Genpei Akasegawa used Thomasson's name to describe a kind of found art. A \"Tomason\" is a part of a building that has lost its meaning or purpose, but still is still interesting. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Oakland Athletics players",
