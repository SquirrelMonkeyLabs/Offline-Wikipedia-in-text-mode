The singer Paul Di'Anno was replaced by Bruce Dickinson in 1982. Bruce Dickinson left in 1993 and was replaced by Blaze Bayley. In 1999, Dickinson returned to the band. The mascot of the band is Eddie, a monster, who is present in the concerts and also appears on the album covers. Eddie is most often shown as a dead body that has come back to life and looks very evil. The band's music shows often have a statue of Eddie that is very large and much taller than the band. Iron Maiden has released many albums. The band's newest album, Senjutsu, was released in 2021. Iron Maiden has sold over 100 million copies of their albums worldwide. == History == === The start of the band (1975–1978) === Iron Maiden was made on 25 December 1975. Steve Harris made the band. He made it after he left the band Smiler. The first name of the band was Ash Mountain. The name changed to Iron Maiden later. This was because many of the band members liked 'Iron Maiden' more. Harris named the band because of the movie The Man in the Iron Mask. The name of the movie reminded him of the iron maiden torture device. The band practiced music for months. Their first concert was at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976. After this, the band played music at the Cart and Horses Pub in Stratford, London. Many of the people in Iron Maiden left the band. Singer Paul Day left the band first. Harris said that he did not have \"energy\" when he sang at concerts. Dennis Wilcock started singing with the band. The band asked guitar player Dave Murray if he wanted to join. Murray was Wilcock's friend. The band already had two guitar players: Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance. They did not want Murray to join the band. Because of this, the band stopped playing music in 1976. Later, they started playing music again. Murray was the band's only guitar player. As of 2023, Harris and Murray have been on all of the band's albums. Guitar player Bob Sawyer joined the band in 1977. The band fired him because he pretended to play the guitar with his teeth. Murray and Wilcock did not like each other. Wilcock got Harris to fire Murray, as well as drummer Ron Matthews. New people joined the band. The new members were keyboard player Tony Moore, guitar player Terry Wapram, and drummer Barry Purkis. Moore left the band because the other members did not like keyboard music. Dave Murray joined the band again in March 1978. Wapram did not like this. Because of this, the band fired Wapram. A few weeks later, Dennis Wilcock left the band to make his own band. It was named V1. He made it with Wapram. Harris, Murray, and Doug Sampson were the members of the band in late 1978. They wanted somebody to be the singer for the band. They met Paul Di'Anno in a pub in Leytonstone in November 1978. Di'Anno joined the band. At this time, Murray was the main guitar player. Many times, he played the guitar by himself. Harris said that Murray \"was so good he could do a lot of it on his own\". === The band makes their first albums (1978–1981) === Iron Maiden recorded a demo with four songs on it. They gave the demo to Neal Kay. Kay was a disc jockey at a heavy metal club. The club was named Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse. Kay listened to the demo. He started playing it at the club. One of the songs on it, \"Prowler\", was number one on the Soundhouse charts. These charts were in the Sounds magazine. Rod Smallwood got the demo as well. Smallwood later managed the band. Iron Maiden became more popular. They released the demo on their record label. They named it The Soundhouse Tapes. It had three songs on it. The band made 5,000 copies of the demo. All of the copies were sold. In December 1979, the band joined EMI. They wanted Adrian Smith (who was the guitar player for Urchin) to join the band. Smith and Dave Murray were friends. Smith was making music with Urchin. He did not want to join Iron Maiden. The band hired guitar player Dennis Stratton instead of Smith. Later, Doug Sampson left the band. He was the band's drummer. The band hired Clive Burr to play the drums. Iron Maiden was on a compilation album named Metal for Muthas. It was released on 15 February 1980. \"Sanctuary\" and \"Wrathchild\" were put on the album. After EMI released the album, Iron Maiden went on a concert tour.

It was their first number one album on the UK Albums Chart. It was also on music charts in many other countries. When the album was released, Dickinson was having legal problems with Samson.

It was named The Beast on the Road. The band played in North America, Japan, Australia and Europe. In the US, a group of American conservatives said the band was Satanic.

As of 2022, the band has sold 20 million copies of the album. In December 1982, the band fired drummer Clive Burr. Nicko McBrain started playing drums for the band.
