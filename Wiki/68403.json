 "text": "British Asians are a group of people in the United Kingdom. British Asians are part of ethnic groups that come from Asia. Asians were 7% of the United Kingdom's population in 2011. The ancestors of most British Asians lived in South Asia. Many British Asians are British Indians, British Pakistanis, or British Bangladeshis, all from South Asia. Most of the others are British Chinese and British Japanese, both from East Asia. Others come from other countries in Asia. After the crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and the passage of the national security law in 2020 at least 144,000 people left Hong Kong and moved to the United Kingdom. In the 2021 census \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" people were 9.3% (5.5 million) of the population of England and Wales. This was the largest percentage increase from 2011, when it was 4.2 million people. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom",
