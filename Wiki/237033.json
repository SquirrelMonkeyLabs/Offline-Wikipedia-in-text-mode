 "text": "Chess Olympiads are chess events open to all national teams. They have been run since 1927 by the world chess organisation, FIDE.There is another world championship for chess teams run by FIDE, but it is not open. In 2010 FIDE chose the five strongest teams, and pitched them against five much weaker teams. The basis for this decision has not been explained. Since 1950, they have been run every two years.List of Chess Olympida Earlier events were all- play-all. Then, as numbers grew, a system of qualifying sections were used. In recent times, the format has been a Swiss system. This, in chess terms, is a method whereby opponents are chosen each round to have similar scores. It has been widely used for individual tournaments.Reuben, Stewart 2005. The chess organiser's handbook. 3rd ed, incorporating the 2005 FIDE laws of chess.

The prospects of chess becoming an Olympic sporting event at some future date remain unclear. The naming of FIDE's team championship as the \"Chess Olympiad\" is of historical origin and implies no connection between this event and the Olympic Games. == Open section Open section== Year Event Location Gold Silver Bronze 1927 1st Chess Olympiad London, United Kingdom 40 38.5 36.5 1928 2nd Chess Olympiad The Hague, Netherlands 44 39.5 37 1930 3rd Chess Olympiad Hamburg, Germany 48.5 47 44.5 1931 4th Chess Olympiad Prague, Czechoslovakia 48 47 46.5 1933 5th Chess Olympiad Folkestone, United Kingdom 39 37.5 34 1935 6th Chess Olympiad Warsaw, Poland 54 52.5 52 1936 non-FIDE unofficial Chess Olympiad * Munich, Germany Hungary 110.5 Poland 108 Germany 106.5 1937 7th Chess Olympiad Stockholm, Sweden 54.5 48.5 47 1939 8th Chess Olympiad Buenos Aires, Argentina 36 35.5 33.5 1950 9th Chess Olympiad Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia 45.5 43.5 West Germany 40.5 1952 10th Chess Olympiad Helsinki, Finland 21 19.5 19 1954 11th Chess Olympiad Amsterdam, Netherlands 34 27 26.5 1956 12th Chess Olympiad Moscow, Soviet Union 31 26.5 26.5 1958 13th Chess Olympiad Munich, West Germany 34.5 29 25.5 1960 14th Chess Olympiad Leipzig, East Germany 34 29 27 1962 15th Chess Olympiad Varna, Bulgaria 31.5 28 26 1964 16th Chess Olympiad Tel Aviv, Israel 36.5 32 West Germany 30.5 1966 17th Chess Olympiad Havana, Cuba 39.5 34.5 33.5 1968 18th Chess Olympiad Lugano, Switzerland 39.5 31 30 1970 19th Chess Olympiad Siegen, West Germany 27.5 26.5 26 1972 20th Chess Olympiad Skopje, Yugoslavia 42 40.5 38 1974 21st Chess Olympiad Nice, France 46 37.5 36.5 1976 22nd Chess Olympiad * Haifa, Israel 37 36.5 35.5 1978 23rd Chess Olympiad Buenos Aires, Argentina 37 36 35 1980 24th Chess Olympiad Valletta, Malta 39 39 35 1982 25th Chess Olympiad Lucerne, Switzerland 42.5 36 35 1984 26th Chess Olympiad Thessaloniki, Greece 41 37 35 1986 27th Chess Olympiad Dubai, UAE 40 39 38 1988 28th Chess Olympiad Thessaloniki, Greece 40.5 34.5 34.5 1990 29th Chess Olympiad Novi Sad, Yugoslavia 39 35.5 35.5 1992 30th Chess Olympiad Manila, Philippines 39 35 34.5 1994 31st Chess Olympiad Moscow, Russia 37.5 35 -II 34.5 1996 32nd Chess Olympiad Yerevan, Armenia 38.5 35 34 1998 33rd Chess Olympiad Elista, Russia 35.5 34.5 32.5 2000 34th Chess Olympiad Istanbul, Turkey 38 37 35.5 2002 35th Chess Olympiad Bled, Slovenia 38.5 37.5 35 2004 36th Chess Olympiad Calviá, Spain 39.5 36.5 36.5 2006 37th Chess Olympiad Turin, Italy 36 34 33 2008 38th Chess Olympiad Dresden, Germany 19 18 17 2010 39th Chess Olympiad Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia 19 18 17 2012 40th Chess Olympiad Istanbul, Turkey 19 19 18 2014 41th Chess Olympiad Tromsø, Norway 19 17 17 2016 42th Chess Olympiad Baku, Azerbaijan 20 20 18 2018 43th Chess Olympiad Batumi, Georgia 18 18 18 2022 44th Chess Olympiad Chennai, India 19 19 18 2024 45th Chess Olympiad Budapest, Hungary 21 17 17 * In 1936 FIDE refused its approval on grounds of Nazi anti-semitism; however, the organisers accepted Jewish players, and many did play in the event.Edward Winter: The 1936 Munich Chess Olympiad * In 1976 the USSR and other communist countries did not compete for political reasons. == Women's section Women's section== Year Event Location Gold Silver Bronze 1957 lst Chess Olympiad Emmen 10.5 10.5 10 1963 2nd Chess Olympiad Split 25 24.5 21 1966 3rd Chess Olympiad Oberhausen 22 20.5 17 1969 4th Chess Olympiad Lublin 26 20.5 19 1972 5th Chess Olympiad Skopje 11.5 8.5 8 1974 6th Chess Olympiad Medellin 13.5 13.5 13 1976 7th Chess Olympiad Haifa 17 11.5 11.5 1978 8th Chess Olympiad Buenos Aires 16 11 11 1980 9th Chess Olympiad Valletta 32.5 32 26.5 1982 10th Chess Olympiad Luzern 33 30 26 1984 11th Chess Olympiad Thessaloniki 32 27.5 27 1986 12th Chess Olympiad Dubai 33.5 29 28 1988 13th Chess Olympiad Thessaloniki 33 32.5 28 1990 14th Chess Olympiad Novi Sad 35 35 29 1992 15th Chess Olympiad Manila 30.5 29 28.5 1994 16th Chess Olympiad Moscow 32 31 27 1996 17th Chess Olympiad Yerevan 30 28.5 28.5 1998 18th Chess Olympiad Elista 29 27 27 2000 19th Chess Olympiad Istanbul 32 31 28.5 2002 20th Chess Olympiad Bled 29.5 29 28 2004 21st Chess Olympiad Calvià 31 28 27.5 2006 22nd Chess Olympiad Torino 29.5 28 27.5 2008 23rd Chess Olympiad Dresden 18 18 17 2010 24th Chess Olympiad Khanty-Mansiysk 22 18 16 2012 25th Chess Olympiad Istanbul 19 19 18 2014 26th Chess Olympiad Tromsø 20 18 18 2016 27th Chess Olympiad Baku 20 17 17 2018 28th Chess Olympiad Batumi 18 18 17 2022 29th Chess Olympiad Chennai 18 18 17 2024 30th Chess Olympiad Budapest 19 18 17 == References == Category:Chess competitions",
