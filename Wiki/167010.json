 "text": "Hurricane Carol was one of the worst hurricanes in New England, which is in United States. Carol formed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25, 1954. Carol was like the New England Hurricane of 1938. Both were fast- moving storms. They also both hit the same area. Carol was the most damaging United States hurricane at the time. ==Retirement== Hurricane Carol was later retired (meaning it was not used for any more hurricanes afterwards) due to the impact in New England. The name \"Carol\" was the first name to be retired from the Atlantic hurricane name lists. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Category 3 Atlantic hurricanes Category:Retired tropical cyclone names Category:1954 in the United States Category:20th century in the Bahamas Category:1950s in North Carolina Category:1950s in New York (state) Category:1954 in Canada Category:1950s in weather",
