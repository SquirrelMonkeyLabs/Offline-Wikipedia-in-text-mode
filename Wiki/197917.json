It took place on October 26, 2008 at the US Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona. It was the fifth and last Cyber Sunday (the third under this name) event held by WWE. Eight professional wrestling matches happened on the card. Like for previous Cyber Sunday events, fans could vote for the competing wrestlers, match types, and more by using the internet and text messages. In the main event, Batista defeated Chris Jericho to win his fourth World Heavyweight Championship. The fans voted for Stone Cold Steve Austin to be the special guest referee. This was also the only Cyber Sunday event to be broadcast in high definition. In 2009, Bragging Rights took over Cyber Sunday's PPV slot. ==Results== ===Voting results=== Poll Results Results Opponent for Shelton Benjamin * R-Truth (59%) * Festus (26%) * Montel Vontavious Porter (15%) * R-Truth (59%) * Festus (26%) * Montel Vontavious Porter (15%) Match type for Kane vs. Rey Mysterio * No Holds Barred match (39%) * Falls Count Anywhere match (35%) * Two out of three falls match (26%) * No Holds Barred match (39%) * Falls Count Anywhere match (35%) * Two out of three falls match (26%) Opponent for Matt Hardy * Evan Bourne (69%) * Finlay (25%) * Mark Henry (6%) * Evan Bourne (69%) * Finlay (25%) * Mark Henry (6%) Tag team match selection * John Morrison and The Miz vs. Cryme Tyme (JTG and Shad Gaspard) (38%) * Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase (c) vs. CM Punk and Kofi Kingston (for the World Tag Team Championship) (35%) * Jamie Noble and Mickie James vs. Layla and William Regal (27%) * John Morrison and The Miz vs. Cryme Tyme (JTG and Shad Gaspard) (38%) * Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase (c) vs. CM Punk and Kofi Kingston (for the World Tag Team Championship) (35%) * Jamie Noble and Mickie James vs. Layla and William Regal (27%) Opponent for Santino Marella * The Honky Tonk Man (35%) * Roddy Piper (34%) * Goldust (31%) * The Honky Tonk Man (35%) * Roddy Piper (34%) * Goldust (31%) Stipulation for Big Show vs. The Undertaker * Last Man Standing match (49%) * \"I Quit\" match (42%) * Knockout match (9%) * Last Man Standing match (49%) * \"I Quit\" match (42%) * Knockout match (9%) Winner of the Divas Halloween costume contest * Beth Phoenix (as a gladiator) * Brie Bella (as Cleopatra) * Candice Michelle (as Marilyn Monroe) * Eve Torres (as a Ninja Turtle) * Jillian Hall (as Batgirl) * Kelly Kelly (as a sailor) * Katie Lea Burchill (as a vampire) * Layla (as Princess Leia) * Lena Yada (as a ninja) * Maria (as a bunny) * Maryse (as a French maid) * Michelle McCool (as a soldier) * Mickie James (as Lara Croft) * Natalya (as a police officer) * Tiffany (as a nun) * Victoria (as a banana) Opponent for Triple H * Jeff Hardy (57%) * Jeff Hardy and Vladimir Kozlov (Triple threat match) (38%) * Vladimir Kozlov (5%) * Jeff Hardy (57%) * Jeff Hardy and Vladimir Kozlov (Triple threat match) (38%) * Vladimir Kozlov (5%) Special guest referee for Chris Jericho vs. Batista * Stone Cold Steve Austin (74%) * Shawn Michaels (22%) * Randy Orton (4%) * Stone Cold Steve Austin (74%) * Shawn Michaels (22%) * Randy Orton (4%) ==Related pages== * WWE Cyber Sunday * List of WWE pay-per-view events ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website Category:2008 in professional wrestling Category:2008 in the United States Category:2000s in Phoenix Category:October 2008 events",
