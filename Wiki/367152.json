Most are able to swim well; some species are actually semi-aquatic and feed mainly on fish and other aquatic animals. Pocock's classification of Prionailurus is widely accepted: * Leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) * Rusty-spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus) * Fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) * Flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) == References == Category:Felines",
