Players can fight alone or team up with someone else against a friend. This game is a sequel to Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64. Super Smash Bros. Melee is for the Nintendo GameCube. The following game is Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii. ==Characters== Super Smash Bros. Melee takes 26 characters from many of Nintendo's series. It includes all 12 veteran characters from Super Smash Bros. 64, and adds 14 new characters, including Princess Peach and Bowser from the Super Mario Bros. series, Princess Zelda/Sheik and Ganondorf from The Legend of Zelda, and new characters like Ice Climbers from Ice Climber and Marth from Fire Emblem. Some characters seem to play more like other characters who were in the first game, like Ganondorf compared to Captain Falcon. Sakurai planned to include more characters, including Diddy Kong, Meta Knight, King Dedede, Balloon Fighter, Urban Champion, Ayumi Tachibana, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bubbles, Excitebike, Solid Snake, and Lucas, but did not have time to fit them in. All of them except for Balloon Fighter made it into Super Smash Bros. Brawl. ===Default characters=== *Bowser *Captain Falcon *Donkey Kong *Fox McCloud *Ice Climbers *Kirby *Link *Mario *Ness *Pikachu *Princess Peach *Samus Aran *Yoshi *Princess Zelda/Sheik ===Unlockable characters=== *Dr. Mario *Falco Lombardi *Ganondorf *Jigglypuff *Luigi *Marth *Mewtwo *Mr. Game & Watch *Pichu *Roy *Young Link ==Items== Items from different games can fall from the sky, like Poké Balls from Pokémon or Mushrooms from Mario.

For example, Poké Balls can summon Pokémon, and Mushrooms can either grow the person whom touches it, unless it is a Poison Mushroom which makes them shrink. ==Stages== Super Smash Bros. Melee has many stages that players can battle on.

Melee has become very popular in tournaments. These tournaments do not use items or most stages, believing that these make the game unfair. In tournaments, however, a lot of characters are not strong enough to win. Some of the best characters for tournaments are Fox McCloud, Falco Lombardi, and Jigglypuff.
