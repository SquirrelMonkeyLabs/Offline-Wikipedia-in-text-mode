 "text": "The Iowa Supreme Court is the state supreme court and the highest court in the U.S. state of Iowa. The Court has seven judges called \"justices\" on it: a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices. The Court normally meets in Des Moines in the Iowa Judicial Branch Building. == The Court == In 1846, Iowa was the 29th state to join the United States. Iowa's government is similar to the federal government of the United States. The government of Iowa has three branches: the legislative branch (the Iowa General Assembly), the executive branch (the Governor of Iowa), and the judicial branch (the Iowa Supreme Court). The Iowa Supreme Court is an appellate court. An appellate court does not have trials, but reviews the decisions of other state courts. The Court does many things: * It is the highest court in the Iowa state court system. Its decisions are binding on all other Iowa state courts. If a case is about federal law, the Supreme Court of the United States may review the Iowa Supreme Court's decision in the case. * It licenses lawyers to practice law in Iowa, makes the rules lawyers have to follow, and can warn lawyers or take away their license to practice if they break the rules. * It makes the rules for the Iowa state courts. * It is in charge of the judicial branch and judicial officers and court employees. == Justices == Justices are appointed – chosen – by the governor from a list of three people chosen by the State Judicial Nominating Commission. A new justice serves a one-year term after appointment and until January 1 after the next judicial retention election. After the election, a justice serves an eight-year term. At the end of a justice's term, there is a retention election – an election to decide if the justice gets another term. A justice must retire at the age of 72. The justices elect the chief justice.
