 "text": "Constitutional law is an area of law that shows how the institutions of a country are organised, and the basic rights of citizens. In most countries, such as the United States, this is found in a written text called a constitution. Some countries use a lot of different texts and unwritten rules instead, such as the United Kingdom. ==State structure== Constitutional law explains how different institutions relate to each other. For example, the relationship between the legislature, executive, and judiciary. In a federal country, constitutional law explains what the powers of the central government and state governments are. ==Human rights== Constitutional law shows citizens what rights they have. Some examples are the United States Bill of Rights, or the European Convention on Human Rights. ==Related pages== *Constitution *Constitution of the United States *Constitutionalism *Political science Category:Types of law",
