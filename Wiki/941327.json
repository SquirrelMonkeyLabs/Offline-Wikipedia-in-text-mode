 "text": "Mumble rap (also referred to as \"SoundCloud rap\") is a loosely defined subgenre of hip hop that became popular in the mid-2010s. The term is a derogatory term for \"melodic rap\" which implies a mumbling or unclear vocal delivery by artists, and is used to describe rappers that predominantly use autotune around their vocals. It may generally refer to rappers who do not share the genre's traditional emphasis on lyricism. A notable mumble rapper is Future. ==References== Category:Hip hop genres",
