It is produced by Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes. It was supposed to be a reboot of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The movie was released to negative reviews on April 30, 2010 and made $115.6 million in the box office. Wes Craven did not like the remake because the movie team refused to work with him, while Robert Englund supported the movie and Haley's performance as Krueger. ==References== Category:2010 horror movies Category:A Nightmare on Elm Street movies Category:Platinum Dunes movies Category:Movies about nightmares Category:Movies about pedophilia Category:Movies set in Ohio Category:Movies set in Indiana",
