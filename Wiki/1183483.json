 "text": "Ethyl tert-butyl ether is a chemical compound made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It is an ether, a chemical where two carbon atoms are connected by bonds to one oxygen atom. It is also known by the acronym ETBE. ETBE is an oxygenate, a chemical added to gasoline and other fuels that helps improve combustion. It replaced the similar methyl tert-butyl ether because of environmental concerns in the 1990s. It overtook MTBE as the most produced ether-based oxygenate in the European Union as of 2005. ETBE can be made from bio-based ethanol, so it is of interest in biofuel production. == References == Category:Ethers",
