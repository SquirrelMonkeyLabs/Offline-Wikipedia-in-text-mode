In the 19th century, it became the property of the Lónyay family; in 1808, it was owned by Gábor Lónyay, and in the early 1900s, by Count Elemér Lónyay and his wife Archduchess Stefánia, who had a beautiful castle here, which Elemér Lónyay's father, Ödön Lónyay, had built in the 1860s. == Population == In 2022, 93.2% of the population identified as Hungarian, 0.4% as Roma, 0.1% each as Romanian, Rusyn, and Slovak, and 1% as other non-local nationalities (6.8% did not respond; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%).
