 "text": "The Supreme Court of Argentina is the highest court of law in Argentina. It started on 15 January 1863. The rulings of the court are final. The court also decides on cases about the constitution. The Supreme Court is the last domestic court authorized to administer justice in Argentina, meaning that its rulings can only be questioned before authorized international bodies, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, although since 2017, the majority of the court has held that no international court can overturn its rulings. It has also been accepted that it is ultimately responsible for exercising constitutional control over norms, in which the constitutionality of a norm or a ruling by lower courts is questioned. The members of the Supreme Court are chosen by the President. ==Current members== The current composition of the Supreme Court is as follows: * President: Dr. Horacio Rosatti. * Vice- President: Carlos Rosenkrantz. * Justices: Dr. Ricardo Lorenzetti ===García-Mansilla Case=== García-Mansilla's case is extraordinary, as on February 25, 2025, President Milei appointed him by decree, and he was sworn in two days later. However, on April 3, 2025, the Senate failed to provide the constitutional approval required to appoint García-Mansilla. The minister ultimately resigned from his position on April 7 of that same year. ==Former members== * Justices: Dr. Juan Carlos Maqueda (30 December 2002 – 27 December 2024) * Justices: Dr. Manuel García-Mansilla (27 February 2025 – 7 April 2025) ==Other websites== Category:Government of Argentina Argentina Category:1863 establishments Category:19th-century establishments in Argentina Category:Organizations based in Argentina",
