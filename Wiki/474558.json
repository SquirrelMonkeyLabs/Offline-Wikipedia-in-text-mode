 "text": "1999 is the fifth studio album from Prince. It contained the hit songs \"Little Red Corvette\", \"1999\" and \"Delirious\". The title track was a protest against nuclear proliferation. The record was released on October 27, 1982. The album's music is pop, funk and R&B.; ==Critical reception and legacy== 1999 was well received by contemporary critics. Reviewing for Rolling Stone in December 1982, Michael Hill praised Prince for \"working like a colorblind technician who's studied both Devo and Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force, keeping the [1999s] songs constantly kinetic with an inventive series of shocks and surprises.\" The Village Voice reviewer Robert Christgau was more reserved in his praise. While conceding that, \"like every black pop auteur, Prince commands his own personal groove ... stretching his flat funk forcebeat onto two discs worth of deeply useful dance tracks\", he also believed that the musician's only reliable subject remains race, leaving the critic with doubts about the messages behind the sex and apocalyptic songs. ==References== Category:1982 albums Category:Funk albums Category:Pop albums Category:Prince (musician) Category:R&B; albums",
