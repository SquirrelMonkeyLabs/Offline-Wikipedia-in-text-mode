The ATS is used for governing the continent. The main idea of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) is to make sure that Antarctica is: * is used peacefully and taken care of. * is not exploited or used for animal hunting. * is not involved with military use unless for peaceful purposes. * is not owned by one group. * is not ruled by any country and/or continent. * is not used for violence e.g. testing nuclear missiles. ==References== Category:1950s treaties Category:Antarctica Category:1959 Category:1961",
