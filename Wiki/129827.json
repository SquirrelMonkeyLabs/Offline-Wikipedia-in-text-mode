Also, it does not compete directly with the Mac version of Microsoft Office, but instead offers tools with a different focus (presentation, rather than analysis) at a lower price. It is made to integrate with other applications from Apple's iLife Suite. Although iLife comes free on every Mac, iWork is sold separately. From February to March 2008, a free 30-day trial of iWork was installed on every new Mac bought during that time, but now the trial must be downloaded from online. It is still given with copies of iLife. It was later sold for $19.99 per app on OS X and $9.99 per app on iOS. In October 2013 Apple announced that all iOS and OS X devices purchased onwards, whether new or refurbished, were eligible for a free download of all three iWork apps. iWork for iCloud, which also incorporates a document hosting service, is free to all holders of an iCloud account. iWork was released as freeware for macOS and iOS in April 2017. In September 2016, Apple announced that the real-time collaboration feature would be available for all iWork apps. ==History== ===iWork '05=== iWork '05 was launched on January 11, 2005 and had the new version 2 of Keynote and the first release of Pages. Before it was released, what would become iWork was said to be an add-on, upgrade, or new release of AppleWorks. ===iWork '06=== On January 10, 2006, Apple introduced iWork '06 at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco, which upgraded Pages to version 2 and Keynote to version 3.Apple press release Apple Announces iWork '06 New features common to both applications included 3D charts, tables with formula support, reviewer comments, and shaped image masking. The addition of tables with formula support may have been added to quiet rumors of an Apple spreadsheet application. Since iWork's focus is on presentation, Apple gave a way to put most common spreadsheet features into a table while providing only limited additional functionality. === iWork '08 === iWork '08 was announced on August 7, 2007 at a special event at Apple's Cupertino campus. New versions of Pages and Keynote were introduced, as was a new spreadsheet application, Numbers. Despite this, hard disk space requirements were reduced from 1.85 GB in iWork '06 to 690 MB in iWork '08. iWork '08 was the end of AppleWorks which was not sold anymore a week later. iWork 08 drops support for Mac OS X v10.3 'Panther'. ==Related pages== *Office suite *Keynote (software) ==References== Category:IWork Category:Office suites Category:Apple software",
