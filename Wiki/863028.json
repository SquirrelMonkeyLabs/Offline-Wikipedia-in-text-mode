 "text": "Nestea is a brand of iced tea first produced by Coca-Cola. It was distributed by Nestlé and The Coca-Cola Company from 1969 until January 2013. Since then it is produced and distributed by Nestlé. There are several tea-based products, both regular and diet, including liquid and powdered concentrates, chilled teas, and bottles of ready-to-drink beverage that are sold in stores or through Vending machines. The drink comes in different flavors, depending on the country. Nestea's largest markets are the United States, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, and Vietnam. When Fuze Beverage was bought by The Coca-Cola Company, in Mexico Nestea was not marketed through Coca-Cola. Fuze Tea was put in its place using the same packaging, which was extremely confusing. It was only through a great media campaign that a clear difference could be made between the two products. == Products == * Sweetened lemon Naturally Flowoured Iced Tea * Diet Sweetened Lemon Naturally Flowoured Iced Tea * Sweetened Green Tea * Unsweetened Iced Tea * Sweetened Iced Tea === Instant Iced Tea Mix === * Sweetened Iced Tea with lemon * Sweetened Iced Tea with lemonade * Unsweetened 100% Tea Regular & Decaffeinated == References == == Other websites == * Official site Category:1948 establishments in the United States Category:Soft drinks Category:Nestlé",
