 "text": "Psychoeducation is a type of therapy where a person is taught about basic mental health and wellness topics. This helps people learn more about themselves and the way their brain works so that they can take better care of themselves. These topics might be things like: Basics of Human Psychology: * Maslow's hierarchy of needs - basic things every human needs to be healthy and happy. * Classical conditioning - a type of learning that happens subconsciously. * Operant conditioning - how an individual changes its behaviour because of the consequences (results) of the behaviour. General Life skills such as: * Communication * Assertiveness * Decision-making * Problem solving How to form and maintain ealthy Interpersonal relationships that don't have harmful things like Domestic violence or Controlling behavior. Learning these things doesn't take as long as other types of therapy, and can help people with many different kinds of problems. Sometimes just knowing more about themselves and the world around them helps people live better and happier lives.",
