 "text": "Asteriornis is an extinct genus of bird from the Upper Cretaceous of Belgium. It is known from a single species called Asteriornis maastrichtensis.Popular account in Dinosaurs, National Geographic ISBN 1536-6596 It was closely related to birds of the living superorder Galloanserae, such as chickens and ducks. Members of the genus were small, long-legged birds (~394 g). They lived near the coastline with more \"primitive\" types of birds such as Ichthyornis. Asteriornis is one of the oldest-known birds: it definitely belongs to the group Neornithes, the modern birds. It has features of both galliformes (chicken-like birds) and anseriformes (duck-like birds). This shows its position as a close relative of the last common ancestor for both groups. == References == Category:Birds Category:Fossils",
