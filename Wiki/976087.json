It is used as a bronchodilator. It helps people with COPD and asthma as preventative drug, known as a preventive inhaler - it is a long- acting drug and usually only needs to be taken once a day. It is used when people have trouble breathing to help them breathe better, such as easing coughing, wheezing and feeling breathless in asthma. It is used by breathing it through the mouth. Its effects last for 24 hours. Some side effects can happen from using it, such as having a dry mouth, runny nose, headache, or having problems with breathing. There are also serious side effects that could happen, such as angioedema and bronchospasms. It has not been proven to be bad to use while pregnant, but this has not been studied very much.
