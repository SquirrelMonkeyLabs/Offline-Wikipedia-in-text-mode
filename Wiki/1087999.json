 "text": "The University Hospital Bonn is a large teaching hospital in Bonn with more than 1306 beds. More than 8,500 people work there. == History == At the same time as the Prussians started the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn in 1818, the first professors and clinics were started for internal medicine, surgery and obstetrics, among others. Because they needed more space, these clinics moved to new buildings on Theaterstraße in the area of today's Beethovenhalle during the German Empire. After World War II, the hospital moved to a large area on the Venusberg in the middle of the Kotten Forest, and now only the Forensic Medicine Institute, the Diamorphine Outpatient Clinic, the Preclinical Institutes and the Dental Clinic remain in the city outside the Venusberg campus. Since 2001, Bonn University Hospital has been independent with its own supervisory board. It is managed by a five- member board of directors. Prof. Dr. med. Dr. h.c. mult. Wolfgang Holzgreve, MBA, has been chairman of the board since 2012. ==References== Category:Bonn Category:University hospitals in Germany",
