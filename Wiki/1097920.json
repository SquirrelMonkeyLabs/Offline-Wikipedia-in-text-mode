 "text": "The Twelve Philosophers (Chinese: 十二哲), also called the Wise Ones, were 12 very important thinkers in ancient China who followed the teachings of Confucius. People respected them a lot and treated them like saints. In Confucian temples, there are special tablets with their names, six on each side of the main hall called the Hall of the Great Completion (Dacheng Dian). People started honoring these philosophers by making special offerings to them in the year 720 AD during the rule of the Tang dynasty. The Twelve Philosophers were Min Sun (also known as Ziqian), Ran Yong (Zhonggong), Duanmu Ci (Zigong), Zhong You (Zilu), Bu Shang (Zixia), You Ruo (Ziruo), Zai Yu (Ziwo), Ran Geng (Boniu), Ran Qiu (Ziyou), Yan Yan (Ziyou), Zhuansun Shi (Zizhang), and Zhu Xi. All of them were students of Confucius, except for Zhu Xi, who lived during the Song dynasty and created a new way of thinking called Neo-Confucianism. == Twelve Philosophers == S.
