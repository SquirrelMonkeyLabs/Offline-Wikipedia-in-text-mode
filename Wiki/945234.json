The iris of the eye is bronze in color with black lines. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for the place they first found it: Parque Nacional Sangay. It is in Ecuador's Morona Santiago province. The word \"sangay\" comes from the Shuar language word \"samkay.\" This word is for volcanoes. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down on the east sides of the mountains. Scientists have seen it at night, sitting on plants 2 m above the ground. Scientists have seen it between 1551 and 1795 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog has young in streams, but no scientist has written about seeing the eggs or tadpoles as of 2022. Scientists have only seen this frog in one protected park, Sangay National Park (Parque Nacional Sangay). ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger. They think people changing the paces where the frog lives could be a problem, mostly if the frog lives outside Parque Nacional Sangay. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
