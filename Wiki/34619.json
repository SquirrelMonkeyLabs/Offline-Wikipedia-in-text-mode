 "text": "Psittacosis is a bacterial disease caused by chlamydia psittaci. It is caught mainly from infected birds such as parrots, pigeons, and parakeets. It can also infect farm animals and other mammals. The disease is not common, with only 50 reported cases in the United States each year. The disease is rarely fatal, with only 1% of those who get the disease dying. == Symptoms == After an incubation period of 5â€“19 days, psittacosis usually gives flu-like symptoms, such as fevers, chills, headaches, muscle aches, and a dry cough. In the first week an infected person can get red eyes (conjunctivitis), nose bleeds, and low white blood cells count. Blood analysis usually shows a normal white cell count, but marked leukocytosis is occasionally apparent . It also can cause diarrhea and vomiting. Sometimes, red/pink marks (called Rose spots) called Horder's spots appear on the skin in this stage. These spots look the same as what people get because of typhoid fever. At the end of the first week, confusion (stupor) and even coma can occur in severe cases. The spleen can become enlarged, before the disease develops into a serious lung infection. This is helpful for diagnosing psittacosis because an enlarged spleen and/or nosebleed at the same time as respiratory fever is indicative of this disease. The disease can also look like pneumonia on an x-ray. In rare cases (see Other presentations) Psittacosis can cause endocarditis, swelling of joints, and swelling of the cornea. === Other presentations === The second week is more like acute bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia than it is psittacosis, with constant high fevers, headaches, cough, and dyspnea (trouble breathing). Headaches up until this point can be so painful that they are mistaken for other conditions, like meningitis. C. Psittaci signs and symptoms can include, but are rare, and not limited to: mendigo-encephalitis, infective endocarditis (inflammation of the inside of the heart, including the valves of the heart), hepatitis, nephritis, splenomegaly, and rash. Others include an enlarged == Diagnosis == Diagnosis is made by serology (testing the serum) to check for chlamydia antibodies in the blood, using microimmunofluorescence (MIF), complement fixation (CF), and immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFA). === Chest scans === Psittacosis shows patchy consolidation (fluid build up in the lungs) and other signs of pneumonia. Diagnosis is done mostly by serum checks. == Treatment == Psittacosis can be easily treated with antibiotics, especially with Tetracycline. == References == Category:Diseases caused by bacteria Category:Zoonoses",
