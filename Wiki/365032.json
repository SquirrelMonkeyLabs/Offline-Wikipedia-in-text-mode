 "text": "Arkona () is a Russian pagan metal band formed in 2002. Their lyrics are influenced by Russian folklore and Slavic mythology. They also use some traditional Russian musical instruments. == History == The band was formed in February 2002 by two neopagans, Masha Arkhipova and Alexander Korolyov. More members joined, and they recorded their first demo, Rus, in 2002. After recording the demo, they started to perform live with bands like Butterfly Temple, Pagan Reign, Svarga, and Rossomahaar. The band broke up in September 2003 because of a lack of enthusiasm from some of the band members. Masha Arkhipova continued to write music, and she presented some of her new work to other bandmates from Nargathrond. The material was released in 2004 in the album, Vozrozhdeniye. By this time, Sergei Atrashkevich, Ruslan Rosomaherov and Vlad Lyovushkin Sokolov joined the band. Their next album, Lepta, was released on the same year.
