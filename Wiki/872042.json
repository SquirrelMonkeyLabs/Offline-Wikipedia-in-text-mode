The skin of the back and backs of the legs are green in color. This frog has a green stripe on each hind leg and a dark stripe on each side. There is orange color on the front legs and inner parts of the hind legs. Parts of the lips are white in color. Scientists named this frog araguaius after the Araguaia River. The frogs live near this river. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over bodies of water that dry up for part of the year. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall down into the water below. This frog lives in the Cerrado in Brazil. It lives in grasslands, including places where humans allow cows and other animals to eat grass, and people have seen it in towns and cities. This frog is not in danger of dying out. Scientists believe it lives in a large area and there are many frogs alive now. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
