 "text": "A distribution amplifier (acronym: DA), is an electronic device. It accepts a single input signal. It also provides this same signal into multiple isolated outputs. They allow a signal to be sent to various destinations without ground loops or signal degradation. There are two types of the distribution amplifier: # Audio distribution amplifier:- It takes a single audio feed, usually a line input. But it may be a microphone input and microphone outputs. # Video Distribution Amplifier:- It takes a video signal as an input, amplifies it, and outputs the amplified video signal to two or more outputs. == Sources == == Other websites == * Info about some very common distribution amplifier types. * Press feeds from distributor Whirlwind USA.
