 "text": "Allobates sumtuosus is a frog. It lives in Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, and Peru. Scientists think it could also live in Colombia. ==Home== People see this frog in forests and on the sides of hills. Scientists have seen the frog between 90 and 100 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog inside protected parks in Peru, Suriname, Brazil, and other countries, for example Mabura Hill Forest Reserve in Guyana and Sipaliwini Nature Reserve in Suriname. There are more protected parks in the place where the frog lives: Estação Ecológica do Grão Pará, Floresta Nacional de Saracá-Taquera, Floresta do Parú, Reserva Biológica do Rio do Trombetas, Reserva Biológica de Maicurú, Floresta de Faro, and Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, and scientists think it could live in these parks too. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. She lays 5-11 eggs at a time. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. Scientists think the female frog might carry tadpoles too, but they are not sure. The tadpoles swim in small pools of water. Sometimes the adult frogs put the tadpoles in foam nests. ==Danger== Scientists from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature say this frog is not in danger of dying out. In some places, humans cut down trees to get wood to build with, and this causes some problems for the frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
