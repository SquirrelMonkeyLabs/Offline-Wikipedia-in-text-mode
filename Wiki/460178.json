 "text": "The Cairn Terrier is a breed of working dogs. It is one of the oldest terrier dog breeds. It is a small terrier from the Scottish Highlands. The breed was used for hunting among the cairns (a cairn is a pile of stones in the Scottish Highlands).Mary Ludington, The Nature of Dogs (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007), p. 61 Cairn Terriers have rough hair or fur that helps to protect the dog from water and dirt. The fur can be blue, red, sandy, gray, or brindle. Pure black, and white are usually not permitted by breeding groups. The Cairn Terrier's hair should not be cut with scissors. The old hair is removed by pulling it by hand.Eileen Geeson, Ultimate Dog Grooming (New York: Firefly Books, 2004), p. 194 This is called hand-stripping. Removing the dead hair like this will let new hair grow. == References == Category:Terriers Category:FCI breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in Scotland",
