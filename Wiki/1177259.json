 "text": "Perija's nurse frog (Aromobates tokuko) is a frog. It lives in Zulia, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams in the mountains in forests near the bottoms of mountains and in evergreen forests higher up on mountains. Most of the places where scientists saw this frog are near villages where indigenous people live. The frog lives on the east side of Sierra de Perijá. Scientists have seen it between 419 and 1005 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog in Sierra de Perijá National Park. ==Young== The male frog calls to female frogs during the day. He hides under a rock or in a log near a stream. Scientists saw tadpooles in pools near streams. Scientists think that the female frog lays eggs in dead leaves on the ground and that, after the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in a little danger of dying out. Some of the forests where it lives were cut down to make big cocoyam farms or to get wood to build with. However, the frog can live on traditional coffee farms. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
