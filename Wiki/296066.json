DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the cooling industry and later, more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair. Some of DuPont's trademarked brands have become genericized. For instance, “neoprene” was originally intended to be a trademark, but quickly came into common usage.
