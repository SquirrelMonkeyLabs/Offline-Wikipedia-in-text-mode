 "text": "Coordination bond is a type of chemical bond. Unlike a covalent bond, the two electrons come from the same atom. They are usually more polar and shorter than covalent bonds. The bond has other names: coordinate covalent bond, dipolar bond, or dative bond. Those names are used in coordination chemistry. They are formed when one atom (called Lewis base) gives an electron pair to another atom (called Lewis base). This chemical reaction gives a coordination compound.
