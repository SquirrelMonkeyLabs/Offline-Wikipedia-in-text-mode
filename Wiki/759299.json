On 13 March, the first two cases were confirmed, a 77-year-old man from Vitina and an Italian woman in her early 20s, who worked in Klina with Caritas Kosova. The Government of Kosovo decided to quarantine and block the entrances and exits of these two cities. After the new cases emerged, the Ministry of Health requested that the Government of Kosovo declare a state of public health emergency. On 22 March, the first Kosovo death from the pandemic was announced. ==References== Category:History of Kosovo Kosovo",
