 "text": "Bromate is an ion. Its chemical formula is BrO3-. It contains bromine in its +5 oxidation state. It is more common than hypobromites, perbromates, and bromites. Sodium bromate is an example. Bromates are strong oxidizing agents. Bromates are made by reacting bromides with ozone. They can also be made by electrolysis of a hot bromide solution. Chlorine dioxide can react with bromide when in sunlight to make bromate. Bromates can be made by reacting potassium hydroxide with bromine. This makes bromide and bromate. Bromates can be made by reacting bromic acid with a base. It might be a carcinogen. It is made when bromide is in water and reacted with ozone or chlorine. Sometimes water with too much bromate has to be gotten rid of. ==Related pages== *Bromous acid Category:Bromine compounds Category:Oxyanions",
