Jurij Dobczansky, a senior Library of Congress cataloging specialist, said: ==Examples== Since the 1930s, many Western scholars have denied the Holodomor for different reasons. The denial is typically associated with communist sympathies, which prevent them from recognizing Ukrainians as equal humans. Holodomor denial is considered racist and dehumanizing. * * * * * * * * ===Soviet Union=== The Soviet Union's regime is said to have denied the Holodomor throughout its existence. * Catherine Merridale, \"The 1937 Census and the Limits of Stalinist Rule\" _Historical Journal_ 39, 1996. * Boriak, Hennadii (Fall 2001). \"The publication of sources on the history of the 1932-1933 famine-genocide: history, current state, and prospects\".

The Yiddish-language Jewish Daily Forward was one of the media that reported the famine. Even though this magazine was run by Jewish Americans, the Soviet-fundedHarvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Kyrill M. Anderson, The Soviet World of American Communism, Yale University Press (1998); .

Many left-wing scholars, with huge influence in Western academia, * * * * * * * * teamed up with the CPUSA to smear Jewish activists who raised awareness about the Holodomor. In recent years, the CPUSA and their academic allies are said to have supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Writing for The New Voice of Ukraine, Kyiv-based film critic Oleksandra Povoroznyk noted: ===Walter Duranty=== In the 1930s, while millions of Ukrainians starved to death, a Moscow-based New York Times journalist named Walter Duranty wrote a series of articles denying the Holodomor and praising Stalin. The articles ironically won Duranty the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, which caused controversies in the following decades. In 2003, the New York Times and Pulitzer Prize board reviewed Duranty's articles separately, yet declined to withdraw his prize. Oksana Piaseckyj, a Ukrainian-American activist who fled to the United States as a child in 1950, referred to Walter Duranty as \"the personification of evil in journalism.\" The controversy about Duranty is the biggest scandal in the history of the New York Times. * * * * * ==Responses== ===Ukraine=== Ukraine passed the in 2006 to ban Holodomor denial. This law recognized Holodomor denial as an insult to the victims' memories and a humiliation of Ukrainians' dignity. ===Germany=== In November 2022, Germany recognized the Holodomor as a genocide. It also banned the approval, denial, and \"gross trivialization\" of genocides or war crimes. They added this law in the new paragraph 5 of section 130 of the German Penal Code ‒ the Strafgesetzbuch. ==Related pages== * Holocaust denial * Rwandan genocide denial * Armenian genocide denial * Cambodian genocide denial * Soviet persecution of Poles during World War II ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Racism Category:Academia Category:Holodomor Category:Genocide denial Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Soviet crimes against humanity",
