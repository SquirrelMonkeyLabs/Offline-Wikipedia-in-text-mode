 "text": "The Samkos bush frog or Samkos jelly-nest frog (Feihyla samkosensis) is a frog. It lives in Cambodia in the Cardamom Mountains, in Phnom Samkos. This frog has a white line from each eye to the mouth in one direction and the shoulder in the other. This frog's bones are light blue in color. This frog has green blood because of the chemical biliverdin. People see this frog in evergreen forests on hills. People see the frogs near pools of rainwater that dry up after a time. This frog lays eggs near the edge of the forest. The female frog lays eggs on plants that hang over the pools of rainwater. Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in a small place. Human beings have cut down the trees in the forests where it lives to build farms and roads and other things and to get wood to build with. People take away trees to make safrole oil to make the drug ecstacy, even though this is against the law. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
