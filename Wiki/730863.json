 "text": "The 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses were a series of elections by the Democratic Party to select the about 3,979 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Those delegates picked the Democratic nominee for president of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election. The elections took place from February to August 2020 in all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and Democrats Abroad. On June 5, 2020, Biden passed the threshold of 1,991 delegates, securing the nomination. ==Background== The 2020 field of Democratic presidential candidates peaked at more than two dozen candidates. According to Politifact, this field is believed to be the largest field of presidential candidates for any American political party since 1972; it exceeds the field of 17 major candidates who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. In May 2019, CBS News referred to the field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates as \"the largest and most diverse Democratic primary field in modern history\", including at least six female presidential candidates. ==Delegate votes== The new superdelegate reforms also regulate how the 2020 Democratic National Convention shall handle the outcome of primaries and caucuses for three potential scenarios: # If a single candidate wins at least 2,268 pledged delegates: Superdelegates will be allowed to vote at first ballot, as their influence can not overturn the majority of pledged delegates. # If a single candidate wins 1,886–2,267 pledged delegates: Superdelegates will be barred from voting at first ballot, which solely will be decided by the will of pledged delegates. # If no candidate wins more than 1,885 pledged delegates: This will result in a contested convention, where superdelegates are barred from voting at the first formal ballot, but regain their right to vote for their preferred presidential nominee for all subsequent ballots needed until the delegates reach a majority. ==Candidates== ===Nominees=== 2020 Democratic Party ticket for President for Vice President Vice President of the United States (2009–2017) U.S. senator from Delaware (1973–2009) Campaign ===Withdrawn=== Candidates in this section are sorted by date of withdrawal from the primaries Bernie Sanders Tulsi Gabbard Elizabeth Warren Michael Bloomberg Amy Klobuchar Pete Buttigieg Tom Steyer U.S. senator from Vermont (2007–present) U.S. representative from VT-AL (1991–2007) U.S. representative from HI-02 (2013–present) U.S. senator from Massachusetts (2013–present) Mayor of New York City, New York (2002–2013) CEO of Bloomberg L.P.
