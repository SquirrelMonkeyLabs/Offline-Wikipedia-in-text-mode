 "text": "A Serbian Film is a horror movie which opened to much controversy. When it was released during 2010, the movie was marked with a Refused Classification rating in Australia. A highly censored version was later approved. It was released in the United States with a rating of NC-17 (No Children 17 or Under Admitted) in May 2011. The movie is about a pornographic movie star who agrees to perform in an art film, but then learns that he has been dragged into a snuff movie filled with necrophilia and other adult themes. A Serbian Film faced severe censorship problems in many countries because of its mature content. ==References== Category:NC-17 rated movies Category:Obscenity controversies Category:2010 horror movies Category:Multilingual movies Category:Serbian movies Category:Movies about necrophilia",
