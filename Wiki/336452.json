 "text": "Asia-Pacific or Asia Pacific (abbreviated as Asia-Pac, Asia Pac, Apac, APAC, APNIC, APJ, JAPA or JAPAC) is the part of the world in or near the Western Pacific Ocean. The region varies in size. It typically includes much of East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and Oceania. The term may also include Russia (on the North Pacific) and countries in North and South America which are on the coast of the Eastern Pacific Ocean; the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), for example, includes Canada, Chile, Russia, Mexico, Peru, and the United States. The term sometimes includes all of Asia and Australasia as well as the many Pacific island nations. Even though imprecise, the term has become popular since the late 1980s in commerce, finance and politics. It is popular even though the economies within the region are not the same.See for example ) == Areas == The Asia-Pacific region generally includes: ==Main countries and territories data== Country or territory Area km² Population Population density per km² GDP millions of USD (2009) GDP per capita USD (2009) Capital 199 55,519 326 537 7,874 Pago Pago 7,617,930 22,462,842 3 920,000 41,500 Canberra 5,765 407,000 70 14,700 36,700 Bandar Seri Begawan 181,035 14,805,000 82 10,900 800 Phnom Penh 9,671,018 1,339,530,000 138 4,911,000 3,700 Beijing 14,874 1,171,000 76 599 500 Dili 1,104 7,055,071 6,390 210,730 30,000 - 3,287,263 1,210,193,422 365 4,060,000 3,339 New Delhi 1,904,569 237,556,363 126 514,900 2,200 Jakarta 377,944 127,470,000 337 5,073,000 39,700 Tokyo 236,800 6,320,000 27 5,721 900 Vientiane 29 541,200 18,662 21,700 39,800 - 329,847 28,318,000 86 191,399 7,525 Kuala Lumpur 1,564,116 2,736,800 2 4,212 1,500 Ulan Bator 676,578 50,496,000 74 26,820 500 Naypyidaw 268,021 4,357,437 16 109,600 25,500 Wellington 120,540 23,906,000 198 27,820 1,200 Pyongyang 462,840 6,732,000 15 8,200 1,200 Port Moresby 299,764 91,983,000 307 158,700 1,700 Manila 710 4,987,600 7,023 177,133 35,500 City of Singapore 100,140 50,062,000 500 800,300 20,000 Seoul 36,191 23,119,772 639 379,400 16,400 Taipei 513,120 67,764,000 132 263,510 3,900 Bangkok 331,210 88,069,000 265 97,119 1,100 Hanoi 147181 27,00,000 251 - - Kathmandu == References == Category:Geography of Asia Category:Oceania",
