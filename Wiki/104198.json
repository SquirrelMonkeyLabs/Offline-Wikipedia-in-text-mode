 "text": "Going commando means wearing no underwear. People have many different reasons for 'going commando.' Some people do it to feel comfortable. Other people do it because their culture (the group they grew up with) does not have underwear. ‘Going commando’ refers to wearing no underwear but still wearing clothes on your bottom half (trousers, etc). ==Benefits== In women, 'going commando' might reduce the risk of developing yeast infections associated with warm damp environments. Tight underwear or undies that aren't from cotton can retain moisture in the genital area and makes it susceptible to bacteria. Nonetheless, there's no research on whether 'going commando' reduces yeast infection. In general, loose fitting and cotton undies should be worn. ==References== Category:Slang Category:Underwear",
