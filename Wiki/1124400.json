 "text": "Malaysian United Indigenous Party, also known as the Bersatu, is a political party in Malaysia. It was founded in 2016 by former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and others. The party played a key role in the Pakatan Harapan coalition, which won the 2018 general election and ended the long-standing rule of the Barisan Nasional coalition. Bersatu was once part of the Pakatan Harapan coalition but left in early 2020. It then joined the Perikatan Nasional coalition with UMNO and other parties. This move led to Muhyiddin Yassin becoming the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Muhyiddin is a leader of Bersatu and served as Prime Minister from March 2020 to August 2021.
