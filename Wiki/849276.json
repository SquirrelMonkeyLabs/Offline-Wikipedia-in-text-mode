Lindsay exploded the bomb that killed himself and 26 other people on a train travelling on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square tube stations.. == Wife == Lindsay's wife, Samantha Lewthwaite, said that Germaine Lindsay wasn't involved in the attacks until the government showed forensic evidence to confirm that he was a bomber.\"NewMuslim at 15, a bombing suspect at 19\" International Herald Tribune 18 July 2005. She later said she was against the attacks and that her husband's mind had been poisoned by \"radicals\". By 2015, she herself had been accused of being behind the deaths of more than 400 people. ==Involvement in London bombings== Lindsay exploded his bomb, killing 26 people, on a train travelling between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. A raid by Scotland Yard found no other bombs at Lindsay's flat. He also owned one of the cars left at Luton railway station before the bombers made their journey to London. ==House arson== On 22 July 2005, police and fire services were called to Lindsay's home in Aylesbury after neighbours reported a strong smell of petrol coming from it. It was suspected to be an arson attack as revenge against the 7/7 attacks on the empty property. Later it was revealed in the local media that Lindsay's wife and son were living under \"police protection\" and would not be returning home. In December 2005, two 17-year-olds were arrested Aylesbury Crown Court of arson in conditions where they were reckless as to whether the life of someone else could be put in danger and each sentenced to 18 months youth detention with a training order. == References == Category:1985 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Suicide bombers Category:People from Huddersfield Category:July 2005 London bombings",
