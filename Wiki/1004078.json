 "text": "Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler (Margaretha Désirée Victoria; born 31 October 1934), is a Swedish princess. She is the eldest sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and also a first cousin of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. ==Early life== Margaretha was born on 31 October 1934 at Haga Palace in Haga Park, Stockholm, as the first child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and his wife, Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. She was born during the reign of her paternal great-grandfather King Gustav V of Sweden. In January 1947, her father died in an airplane crash. Although the eldest child, as a female, she was never in line to the throne according to the Swedish constitution current at the time. She was educated privately at the Haga Palace and then at the Stockholm dressmaking school, Märthaskolan (Martha School). ==Marriage== She met her future husband, businessman John Ambler, at a dinner party in the United Kingdom in 1963. Their engagement was announced on 28 February 1964. They were married on 30 June 1964, in Gärdslösa Church, on the island of Öland. The Princess wore a wedding gown from the Stockholm couture school, Märthaskolan, where she had previously been a student, and a traditional wedding crown from Öland. As a result of her unequal marriage, she lost her style of Royal Highness and the King gave her the courtesy title of Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler. Under the Swedish constitution of that time, she, as a woman, and her descendants were not able to inherit the throne. As a result, they still are not. Ambler and her husband separated in 1994, but never divorced. He died on 31 May 2008. Margaretha and John Ambler's marriage produced three children: Sybilla (b. 1965), Edward (b. 1966), and James (b. 1969). Her daughter married Baron Henning von Dincklage and has two children, of whom Madeleine Charlotte Margaretha von Dincklage is the goddaughter of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and was a bridesmaid at her wedding. ==Titles and styles== * 31 October 1934 – 30 June 1964: Her Royal Highness Princess Margaretha of Sweden * 30 June 1964 – present: Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler ==Ancestry== ==References== Category:1934 births Category:Living people Margaretha 1934 Category:House of Bernadotte Category:Disinherited European royalty",
