It is celebrated on International Women's Day. The first Aurat March happened on March 8, 2018, in Karachi. It was started by women's groups working with the Pakistani #MeToo movement. In 2019, similar marches were held in Lahore, Karachi, and other cities. These events were organized by groups like Hum Auratein (We the Women), the Women Democratic Front (WDF), and the Women's Action Forum (WAF). The Lady Health Workers Association also supported the march and many women's-rights organizations joined in. == References == Category:Feminism Category:Socialism Category:Pakistan",
