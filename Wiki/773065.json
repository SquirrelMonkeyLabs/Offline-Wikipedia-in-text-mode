 "text": "The chattering rock frog (Litoria staccato) is a small frog from Australia. It lives in Western Australia. This frog can grow to 3.5 cm long from nose to rear end. This frog can be dark red, light brown or gray in colour. It has some stripes on its head and body and some webbing on its feet. They lay eggs in the rocky streams and other rocky bodies of water. The eggs sink to the bottom. The tadpoles swim to the top and stay near the surface. They take two months to become frogs. Scientists think this frog is related to L. coplandi. People tell them apart because their voices sound different. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
