 "text": "Baltic Station () is the main railway station in Tallinn, Estonia, and the largest railway station in Estonia. All local commuter, long-distance and international trains depart from the station. The planned Rail Baltica line will not go here, but to Ülemiste railway station. Balti jaam is in central Tallinn immediately northwest of the city's Old town. It stands close to a large market called the Baltic Station Market. The first station opened in 1870 when a railway line connecting Saint Petersburg with Paldiski via Tallinn was opened. The station was completely reconstructed between 1960–1966, and in 2005, the station building was completely renewed. ==References== Category:1870 establishments in Europe Category:Establishments in Estonia Category:Rail transport in Estonia Category:Tallinn Category:Railway stations in Europe",
