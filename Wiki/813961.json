 "text": "Echinococcosis is an infection caused by tapeworms. Animals such as dogs and sheep are able to transmit the disease. Risk factors are coming in contact with feces of livestock, dogs and foxes. Humans become infected swallowing tapeworm eggs in the contaminated food. Then eggs can spread to liver, lungs and brain forming cysts. That is why Echinococcosis is also called Hydatid cyst disease. Cysts can be found using ultrasound, computer tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. To confirm the diagnosis ELISA, immunological test should be done. Treatment includes antiparasitic medications. Surgical intervention such as cyst aspiration is recommended to avoid to prevent to spread of the infection. == Related pages == * Chlamydia psittaci * Enterobiasis (Pinworm infection) Category:Diseases caused by parasites",
