New York, UNICEF. *City proper: The area that is officially part of the city, according to the government. *Urban area: An area of built-up land, with many roads, buildings, and infrastructure. It usually has many people close together, who do not work in farming. Rural land is the opposite: it has a small number of people and buildings. In this list, an urban area is an area of urban land that is continuous: it has no spaces in between that are rural. *Metropolitan area: An urban area, and nearby areas where people frequently travel (commute) to the urban area. Some of these areas are suburbs and some can have a small number of people.
