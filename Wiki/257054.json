 "text": "Lennon–McCartney (sometimes McCartney–Lennon) was the songwriting partnership between the two English musicians John Lennon (1940-1980) and Paul McCartney (born 1942). It is one of the best-known and most successful musical partnerships in history. Between 1962 and 1969, they wrote about 180 credited songs. Most of the songs were recorded by the band they were both part of, The Beatles. Other songs credited to Lennon–McCartney were originally released not by the Beatles but by other artists, especially those managed by Brian Epstein. Recording a Lennon–McCartney song helped start new artists' careers. For example, one of The Rolling Stones' first singles, \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", was a Lennon–McCartney song, and was not written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (the Jagger-Richards songwriting partnership of the Stones).
