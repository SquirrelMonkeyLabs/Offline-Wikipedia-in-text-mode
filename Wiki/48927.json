 "text": "Pantheism is the belief that God and the universe are equivalent (the same thing). A pantheist believes that everything that exists is a part of God, or that God is a part of everything that exists. The name pantheism comes from the Greek words theos (belief in God) and pan (all). ==Overview== Pantheism is not only one religion or full set of beliefs. Any doctrine or philosophy that believes that the universe and everything in it is God is said to be pantheistic. Discussion about pantheism usually avoids using words like \"God\", \"church\", and \"worship\", because those words can make others believe pantheism is like a traditional religion. Many pantheists have a personal relationship with the universe and the natural world. Making these relationships better is a key idea for these pantheists. Some pantheists believe the universe is sacred, and that the earth and nature must be protected. ==History== Pantheistic beliefs date back to ancient times. Most of the early Greek philosophers from Thales on to the Stoics believed in some sort of pantheism. Pantheism is an important part of many Eastern religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, and modern religions such as Druidism. Some Western philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza are pantheists, as are some scientists. ===Abrahamic religions=== Some Christians, Jews and Sufis say they are pantheists. However, their majority believes that while God is in everything, there is more to God than just the universe. There are several different types of pantheism, including panpsychism (the belief the universe itself has a mind), naturalistic pantheism (the belief the universe is identifiable with the title of \"God\", as it can be seen as a wondrous and transcendent power), and scientific pantheism (the worship of nature as a life-giving force). ==Related pages== * Paganism * Christianity * Panentheism * Platonic realism * Greek mythology * Roman mythology ==Other websites== * Hindu Wisdom * Pantheist Prophet: Henry David Thoreau by Harold W.
