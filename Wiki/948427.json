 "text": "The Miami are a Native American Nation. They lived around the Great Lakes in parts of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. They were part of the Northeastern Woodlands. They are also part of the Algonquian language family. The Miami included the Piankeshaw, Wea, Pepikokia, Kilatika, Mengakonkia, and Atchakangouen. Most were forced to move to Indian Territory in the 19th century. The Miami Tribe of Oklahoma is the only Miami people tribe recognized by the US Government. == History == The Miami were originally part of the Mississippian Culture. They moved North around the Great Lakes. Conflict with the Iroquois in the Beaver Wars reduced the population. The Miami eventually went back to their territory in the 18th century. There was conflict with American settlers after the Treaty of Paris. In this treaty, Great Britain gave the lands including Indiana, Michigan and Ohio to the United States. The Miami supported tribes coming from the east like Lenape and Shawnee. The Americans attacked Natives in the region several times. The Battle of Fallen Timbers was the last battle of the Northwest Indian War. The war ended with the Treaty of Greenville (1795). Tribe leaders gave up most of their land in Ohio. Some Miami still resisted and supported the Shawnee Tecumseh. In the 19th century tribes were forced to move to Indian Territory in Oklahoma. ==References== Category:Native Americans",
