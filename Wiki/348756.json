 "text": "The Korea Strait (, Daehan Haehyeop), also known as the Tsushima Strait, is a narrow body of water between Japan and South Korea. The name is used in two ways. It identifies the sea between Korea and Tsushima Island; and it is also used generally to describe the wider ocean area between Korea and the island of Kyushu.US Department of State, \"Limits in the Seas, No. 121; Straight Baseline and Territorial Sea Claims: South Korea,\" p. 23; retrieved 2012-9-4. The strait links the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Tsushima Island is between the western channel (Korea Strait) and the eastern channel (Tsushima Strait). ==Geography== The northern shore of the strait is the southern coast of the Korean peninsula. Depending on usage, the southern shores of the strait may mean the western coast of Tsushima or it may mean the western coasts of Ky큰sh큰 and Honsh큰. The strait is about wide and averages about 90 to 100 meters (300 ft) deep. The western channel is deeper (up to 227 meters) and narrower than the eastern channel. A warm current (Tsushima-kairy큰) runs through the straight from south to north. ==Related pages== * Russo-Japanese War ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Bodies of water of South Korea Category:Straits of Japan Category:Pacific Ocean",
