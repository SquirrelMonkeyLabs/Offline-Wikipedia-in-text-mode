 "text": "The executioner tree frog, executioner clown frog or hangman swamp frog (Dendropsophus carnifex) is a frog that lives in the Andes Mountains in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 1250 and 2500 meters above sea level. Scientists think it might also live in Colombia. The adult male frog is 24.6 to 27.7 mm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 29.2 to 32.5 mm long. This frog is pale in color, light brown to bronze, with darker marks on its skin. It is called the \"executioner tree frog\" because scientist John D. Lynch found many of the sample frogs. In English, \"lynch\" means to kill someone by hanging them by the neck. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
