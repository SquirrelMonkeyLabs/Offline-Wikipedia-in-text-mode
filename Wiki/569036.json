 "text": "Abenaki, or Abnaki, is an endangered Algonquian language of Quebec and the northern states of New England. The language has Eastern and Western forms. They differ in vocabulary and phonology. They are sometimes considered distinct languages. Eastern Abenaki languages were spoken by several peoples, including the Micmac, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot of coastal Maine. The last known fluent speaker of Eastern Abenaki (Penobscot) died during the 1990s. However, several Penobscot elders still speak Penobscot. There is an ongoing effort to preserve it and teach it in the local schools. Only a handful of Western Abenaki speakers remain today. == References == Category:Languages of North America Category:Endangered languages",
