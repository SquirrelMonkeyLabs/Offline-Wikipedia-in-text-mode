 "text": "Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Godard (; born 3 October 1938), better known simply as PPK, is a Peruvian economist, politician and public administrator. He is the 66th President of Peru serving from 2016 until his resignation in 2018. He previously served as Prime Minister of Peru from 2005 to 2006. ==President== Kuczynski was a presidential candidate in the 2011 presidential election, placing third. Kuczynski went on to stand in the 2016 election, where he narrowly defeated Keiko Fujimori, daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori. He was sworn in as President on July 28, 2016. On 15 December 2017, the Congress of Peru began impeachment proceedings against Kuczynski, after he was accused of lying about receiving payments from a scandal-hit Brazilian construction firm in the mid-2000s. However on 21 December 2017 the Peruvian congress lacked the majority of votes needed to impeach Kuczynski. After further scandals and facing a second impeachment vote, Kuczynski resigned the presidency on 21 March 2018 following the release of videos showing alleged acts of vote buying, presenting his resignation to the Council of Ministers. On April 10, 2019, he was arrested along with his secretary Gloria Kisic Wagner and his ex-driver Jos√© Luis Bernaola for an alleged crime of money laundering in the Odebrecht case. In turn, he authorized the Prosecutor's Office to search for 48 hours the homes linked to their surroundings in search of documents related to that case. ==Related pages== *List of scientists from South America ==References== ==Other websites== * * Pedro Pablo Kuczynski profile - El Mundo newspaper * PPK on Twitter * Newsweek interview with Kuczynski * Biography by CIDOB Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Peru Category:Prime ministers of Peru Category:Economists Category:Politicians from Lima",
