Hawthorne was reportedly inspired by viewing the Faun of Praxiteles in the Capitoline Museum. H.G. Wells' 1895 book The Time Machine is set in the year 802,701CE. While exploring the far future, the Time Traveller sees \"a statuea faun, or some such figure, minus the head.\" === 1940s-1950s === There is a faun called Mr. Tumnus in C. S. Lewis' famous novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1949). According to Lewis, the entire Chronicles of Narnia story came to him from a single picture he imagined of a faun carrying parcels and an umbrella through a snowy forest. In Lolita (1955) the main character is attracted to young adolescent girls, whom he calls \"nymphets\".

The Chronicles of Narnia film series (released between 2005-2010) portrays fauns as different from satyrs, which are more goat-like in form. In Guillermo del Toro's 2006 film (Pan's Labyrinth), a faun guides the film's protagonist, Ofelia, to a series of tasks. These tasks lead her to a wondrous netherworld. === 2011 - present === In Rick Riordan's The Son of Neptune (2011), the character Don is a faun. In the book, several fauns appear, begging for money.
