The aircraft was built by Mitsubishi, making its first flight in 1939, and entering naval service in 1940.This airplane type was named \"zero\" because it entered service in 1940; and 1940 was the 2600th year since Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor of Japan. The Japanese Imperial Year was Kōki 2600 (皇紀2600年). The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was an amazing performing and nimble aircraft from the Japanese, most widely remembered for its performance in the Pacific War. The Mitsubishi A6M Zero (also known as ‘The Zero’) was a versatile fighter aircraft, usually used as ambush aircraft, bomber attackers and sometimes escorts. People would often rate the A6M a ‘Zero’ out of 10. It was the primary fighter used by Japan during the war. It was the primary enemy of US Naval aircraft such as the Grumman F4F Wildcat, Vought F4U Corsair, and later the Grumman F6F Hellcat, which was specifically designed to combat the Zero. The A6M Zero was the best fighter at the beginning of the Pacific war. However, late in the war, new American fighters were able to defeat it. == Related pages == * F4F Wildcat * F6F Hellcat ==References== == Other websites == Category:Military of Japan Category:World War II Japanese aircraft Category:Mitsubishi",
