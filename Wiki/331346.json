 "text": "Wolf Vostell (14 October 1932–3 April 1998) was a German artist. He made arts in many forms including sculpture, video art, and installations. He was an important artist in the second half of the 20th century. He believed that art should take place in the street, and that the audience should be involved. One of his works, called 130 kms per hour, was a crash between a train and a car. ==References== == Other websites == * Leverkusen who's who * The Vostell Museum in Malpartida de Cáceres, Spain * Fantastic Architecture, Dick Higgins and Wolf Vostell * About Wolf Vostell - english text Category:1932 births Category:1998 deaths Category:German artists",
