Buildings are usually fitted with revolving doors to save energy: Revolving doors can be made to hinder airflow. This means that less heat is lost. The first to develop revolving doors was H. Bockhacker. In 1881, he registered a patent in Germany for a \"door without airflow\". Theophilus Van Kannel registered a patent for what he called \"storm door\", in 1888.Beardmore A. 2000.
