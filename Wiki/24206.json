 "text": "Canidae is a family of carnivorous and omnivorous mammals of the order Carnivora. Animals that belong to the family Canidae are canids. The family Canidae is divided into two tribes: Vulpini (foxes), and Canini (wolves, dogs, coyotes, and jackals). The family Canidae also includes the genus Urocyon (gray foxes and island foxes) and two extinct groups of canids: Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae. Canids that belong to Vulpini are \"vulpines\". Canids that belong to Canini are \"canines\". Canines are usually pack animals which hunt their prey in a group. Foxes usually hunt alone. However, almost all canids are social animals. Canids live on every continent on Earth, except for Antarctica. Many of them reached certain areas alongside humans. One kind of canid, the dog, became a domestic animal. This made dogs the most well-known canids, and one of the most widely kept pets. == Taxonomy == * Tribe Vulpini, foxes ** Genus Vulpes *** Indian fox, Vulpes bengalensis *** Blanford's fox, Vulpes cana *** Cape fox, Vulpes chama *** Corsac fox, Vulpes corsac *** Tibetan fox, Vulpes ferrilata *** Pale fox, Vulpes pallida *** Rüppell's fox, Vulpes rueppelli *** Swift fox, Vulpes velox *** Kit fox, Vulpes macrotis *** Red fox, Vulpes vulpes *** Fennec, Vulpes zerda ** Genus Alopex *** Arctic fox, Alopex lagopus ** Genus Urocyon *** Gray fox, Urocyon cinereoargenteus *** Island fox, Urocyon littoralis ** Genus Otocyon *** Bat-eared fox, Otocyon megalotis * Tribe Canini, Dogs ** Genus Dusicyon *** Falkland Island fox, Dusicyon australis† ** Genus Pseudalopex *** Culpeo, Lycalopex culpaeus *** South American grey fox, Lycalopex griseus *** Darwin's fox, Lycalopex fulvipes *** Pampas fox, Lycalopex gymnocercus *** Sechura fox, Lycalopex sechurae *** Hoary fox, Lycalopex vetulus ** Genus Atelocynus *** Short-eared dog, Atelocynus microtis ** Genus Cerdocyon *** Crab-eating fox, Cerdocyon thous ** Genus Speothos *** Bush dog, Speothos venaticus ** Genus Chrysocyon *** Maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus ** Genus Nyctereutes *** Raccoon Dog (Tanuki), Nyctereutes procyonoides ** Genus Cuon *** Dhole, Cuon alpinus ** Genus Lycaon *** African wild dog, Lycaon pictus ** Genus Canis *** Grey wolf, Canis lupus **** domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris *** Red wolf, Canis rufus *** Coyote, Canis latrans *** Golden jackal, Canis aureus *** Black- backed jackal, Canis mesomelas *** Side-striped jackal, Canis adustus *** Ethiopian wolf, Canis simensis *** Eastern wolf, Canis lycaon == Gallery == Image:Coyote arizona.jpg|Coyote Image:FemaleYellowLabrador.jpg|Dog (Labrador Retriever) Image:Golden Jackal Revivim.jpg|Jackals Image:Marderhund.jpg|Raccoon dog (tanuki) Image:Vulpes_vulpes_laying_in_snow.jpg|Red Fox Image:Front view of a resting Canis lupus ssp.jpg|Wolf ==References== == Other websites == * canids.org Category:Canids",
