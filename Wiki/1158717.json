Originally focused on small and medium businesses, the bank later expanded its services to include corporate and personal banking. It serves about 215,000 customers through 26 branches and online channels, making it the leading bank in all business sectors in Montenegro. Its headquarters are in Podgorica, but a significant portion of its activity is linked to the coastal region, driven by the growing tourism industry. In 2006, OTP Bank acquired 100% of CKB for 105 million euros, making it the leading bank in Montenegro and part of the OTP Group. This acquisition reflected the bank's market position and the growth potential of Montenegro's economy. ==References== Category:Montenegro Category:Banks of Europe",
