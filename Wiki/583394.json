Since 2017, she has been a member of the senior Scotland national team. ==International career== Howard played twice for the Germany women's national under-20 football team in 2012. She was named in Germany's squad for the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Japan, but did not get to play in any matches. In 2016 she was called into a training camp for England's new \"Next Gen\" team. She said: \"Although I was born and brought up in Germany it’s always been my ambition to play for England, and hopefully I’ve now taken my first step.\" In March 2017 she was called up into the Scotland national team. The Scots had three injured defenders and were allowed to pick Howard because her grandfather is Scottish. She made her senior international debut on 11 April 2017, as a 64th-minute substitute in a 5–0 friendly defeat by Belgium in Leuven. ==References== ==Other websites== *Profile at FIFA *Profile at TSG 1899 Hoffenheim *Profile at German Football Association Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Hanau Category:Scottish footballers",
