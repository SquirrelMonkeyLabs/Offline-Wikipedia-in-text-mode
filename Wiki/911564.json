 "text": "Feminine is a grammatical gender, present in all languages that have this grammatical category. It usually applies to animate objects of the female gender, but is also often used with inanimate, and in some cases animates of the male gender. For example, in Spanish language the words mesa (table) and persona (person) are feminine and epicene, because they don't have a feminine natural gender such as the word madrina (godmother). Some words are feminine and inanimate, such as in Italian tovaglia (tablecloth) while donna (woman) is animate. == References == Category:Grammar Category:Gender",
