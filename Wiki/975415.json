 "text": "The Copan brook frog (Duellmanohyla soralia) is a frog. It lives in Honduras and Guatemala. Scientists have seen it between 40 and 1200 meters above sea level in Honduras and between 725 and 1200 m above sea level in Guatemala. The adult male frog is 26.8-32 mm long from nose to rear end and the largest adult female frogs are 38 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown with green and black marks. The iris of the eye is red in color. The tadpoles swim in pools in mountain streams where the water moves slowly. This frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to collect wood for building. Diseases can also kill this frog. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog. The frog's scientific name comes from the Greek language word \"soralia,\" which is about lichen. The marks on the frog's back make scientists think of lichen. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
