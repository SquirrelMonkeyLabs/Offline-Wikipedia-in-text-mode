 "text": "Tyson Luke Fury (born 12 August 1988) is a British professional boxer. He has held the WBC and The Ring heavyweight titles since beating Deontay Wilder in February 2020. Fury also won the unified WBA, IBF, WBO,and lineal titles when he beat Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. Fury had his IBF title taken away later that year because did not agree to fight against Vyacheslav Glazkov even though he was meant to accept the challenge. He chose to fight against Klitschko again instead. In 2016, Fury vacated the WBA, WBO,and lineal titles because of medical issues, problems in his personal life, and the Klitschko rematch being cancelled twice. As of 2021, Fury is ranked as the world's best heavyweight by BoxRec, Transnational Boxing Rankings Board and ESPN. Having been told be could not fight for Ireland at the Olympic Games, he was allowed to fight for both Great Britain and Ireland after tracing his family back to relatives in Belfast and Galway. Fury has fought for both England and Ireland as an amateur, winning the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 before turning professional later that year. He has since held the British and English heavyweight titles twice each, as well as the European, Commonwealth, and Irish heavyweight titles. == References == Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:British boxers Category:English Roman Catholics Category:Sportspeople from Greater Manchester",
