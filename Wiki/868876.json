 "text": "The white-lined leaf frog or white-lined monkey frog (Phyllomedusa vaillantii) is a frog that lives in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Surinam, Colombia, and Brazil. The adult male frog is to long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is to long. Male and female frogs do not look the same: their noses are different shapes. This frog is mostly green with reddish-brown color on its sides. It has whitish or orange spots. It can have red, lavender, or orange color on its legs. Its belly is light orange. This frog lives in trees. It hides during the day and looks for food at night. This frog lays eggs at the rainiest part of the year. The frog builds a nest out of leaves over a pond or other body of water. It puts the eggs in the nest with jelly over them so they do not dry out. When the tadpoles hatch out of the eggs, they fall out of the nest into the water. Sometimes the tadpoles breathe air during the day, but they do not do this at night. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
