It claims to be the second oldest zoo in the United States because it opened 14 months after the Philadelphia Zoo. The zoo has of land and about 2,800 animals. It has over 30 indoor and outdoor attractions, and is also the location of the death of Harambe. The Cincinnati Zoo also breeds rare animals. For example, it was the first zoo to breed the California sea lion and one of the first to breed the American bison both in 1878. It is the only place in the Western Hemisphere where three Sumatran Rhinoceroses have been born. == History == The Cincinnati Zoo started in 1875. It covered and was owned by some of the richest men in Cincinnati. There are currently around 500 species at the zoo with a total of around 1900 animals. There are also over 6,000 plant species shown at the zoo. The zoo is home to Indian blue peafowls that are free to roam in the aviary. == Ecofriendly == In the late 2000s, the Cincinnati Zoo was named the Greenest Zoo in America for their \"go green\" practices. The zoo currently has ten special garden exhibits and has over 5,000 other plant species spread throughout the zoo. In early 2010, the zoo completed their construction of over 6,000 solar canopies in the main parking lot. This is the largest display of solar panels in the world. The zoo also displays plants in the animal exhibit in which they are the correct biome for that species. For example, there are many Florida native marsh plants and shrubs in Manatee Springs; bamboo gardens in the red panda exhibits; and bushes from California in the sea lion exhibit. == Outdoors == ===Wildlife canyon and Sumatran rhinos=== Since 1989, Wildlife Canyon has been showcasing rare and exotic hoofstock species that are native to many parts of the world.
