Asimov's novels have influenced science fiction on television and movie. Especially his 'Three Laws of Robotics' is a lasting contribution to our thinking. # A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. # A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. # A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. == Beliefs == Although ethnically a Jew, Asimov was an atheist: :\"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me quite a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow ... it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic\".Free Inquiry (Spring 1982). Wikiquote == Death == When he had heart surgery in 1983, he received blood infected with HIV. He developed AIDS, and died of the effects of the medical condition in 1992. His widow did not speak of this until years later. == Related pages == * Arthur C.
