 "text": "Biberach (IPA: ['bi:bərax]; Alemannic German: Landchrais Bibra) is a district in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is surrounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Ravensburg, Sigmaringen, Reutlingen and Alb-Donau, and the Bavarian districts Neu-Ulm, Unterallgäu and the district-free city Memmingen. The most important towns in the district of Biberach are Biberach (Riß), Riedlingen, Ochsenhausen and Laupheim. == Geography == The district has hilly countryside between the rivers of the Danube and the Iller. The Danube crosses the district in its westernmost part from south to north. The Iller forms the eastern border of the district. Another river is the Riß, an affluent of the Danube (the river Riß goes into the Danube). It goes across the district from south to north. The Federsee is a small lake in the southwest of the district. Its area is only 1.4 km², but it is famous for Neolithic findings and birds that are not seen a lot. == Media == The local newspaper is the Schwäbische Zeitung (\"Swabian Newspaper\"). The Biberach Independent Film Festival focusses on experimental shorts and documentaries. The festival starts at the end of October and runs into November. == Coat of arms == The imperial eagle symbolizes the imperial city of Biberach. At first, the coat of arms of the city showed an eagle as well as a beaver as a canting symbol. In 1488 the coat of arms of the city was changed to show only the beaver. The crosier symbolises the monasteries of the area. == Cities and towns == Cities Towns #Bad Buchau #Bad Schussenried #Biberach (Riß) #Laupheim #Ochsenhausen #Riedlingen #Achstetten #Alleshausen #Allmannsweiler #Altheim #Attenweiler #Berkheim #Betzenweiler #Burgrieden #Dettingen an der Iller #Dürmentingen #Dürnau #Eberhardzell #Erlenmoos #Erolzheim #Ertingen #Gutenzell-Hürbel #Hochdorf #Ingoldingen #Kanzach 20.
