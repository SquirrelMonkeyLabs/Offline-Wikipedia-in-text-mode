 "text": "Local 58 is an analog horror series made by Kris Straub. It is also a spin off of his other series, Candle Cove, according to Kris himself. As of March 2024, it currently has 11 episodes, which are in a YouTube channel called LOCAL58TV. In each episode, it plays out as found footage from a small public access television channel. In each episode, the channel would be hijacked, causing creepy messages to appear. In September 2021, Kris Straub would make a website named local58.tv, which made people make up theories from the website's hidden secrets. In the website, there is a knock-off version of the WayBack Machine named \"LookBack Web Archives\". == References == Category:Horror movies",
