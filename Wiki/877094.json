 "text": "Just Dance Wii is a Japanese video game franchise based on Just Dance made just for Wii and Wii U systems. The games have a few songs from the actual series. However, most of the series is Japan exclusive. == Gameplay == Just like the regular games, you are tasked to follow the dancer or coach on screen as if you were a reflection in a mirror. The game's UI looks very similar to Just Dance 2, 3 or 2014. The scoring system is the same as the actual titled series and looks exactly like Just Dance. You are tasked to get up to 5 stars. You can play with 4 people (with the exception of Hold My Hand songs that allow you to play with 8 players). == Games == * Just Dance Wii (Just Dance 2 for Japan) * Just Dance Wii 2 (Just Dance 3 for Japan) * Just Dance Wii U (Just Dance 2014 for Japan) * Yo-kai Watch Dance: Just Dance Special Version (Just Dance 2014 with Yo-Kai watch songs.)
