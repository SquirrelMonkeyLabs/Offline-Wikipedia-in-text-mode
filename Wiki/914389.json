 "text": "The Alliance of Free Democrats – Hungarian Liberal Party (, SZDSZ) was a Hungarian political party from 1990 to 2013, known for its liberal ideas. It was part of the government coalition from 1994 to 1998 and from 2002 to 2008. The SZDSZ began in the 1970s as a small, illegal group opposing the communist Kádár regime. They printed and shared secret publications called samizdats, which was risky. == History == In 1988, intellectuals around the magazine Beszélő formed the Network of Free Initiatives on May 1 to connect opposition groups. Over 200 people signed its founding document, and a 50-member temporary council was set up. On November 13, 1988, at a meeting in Budapest’s Jurta Theater, 998 out of 1,100 attendees voted to create the SZDSZ. The meeting approved the party’s principles and chose nine leaders. The party adopted its program in 1989 at meetings in the Corvin Cinema on March 19 and April 16. On October 27–29, 1989, a second meeting elected an 11-member leadership team. In 1990, the SZDSZ became a major opposition party after the first free elections. In 1994, it joined a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), which surprised many since the MSZP won 54.14% of votes and didn’t need the SZDSZ’s 30.68%. The SZDSZ got three of 26 ministerial posts: interior, transport, and education. This gave them little influence, and tensions with the MSZP grew due to poor coordination. In 2002, they rejoined the MSZP coalition but faced similar issues. The party dissolved in October 2013. ==Notes== Category:1988 establishments in Europe Category:2013 disestablishments in Europe Category:Defunct political parties in Hungary",
