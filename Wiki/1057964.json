 "text": "The WAGR Q class were a total of 6 side tank steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1896 to 1925. The Q class were originally ordered from R. & W. Hawthorn Leslie & Coy of Newcastle-upon- Tyne, England, however, two similar locos built previously for the Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de Mo√ßambique in Mozambique were cancelled before shipment and in 1896 were sold to the WAGR along with four more engines as part of the original order built from 1896 to 1897. They were employed as shunters at Midland and Fremantle, with four of the class rebuilt into Qa class locos from 1905 to 1909. All 6 of the class were withdrawn and scrapped between 1924 and 1925, having worked on various lines around the network. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
