 "text": "Absurdism is a type of philosophy. People who support and argue for absurdism are known as 'absurdists'. Absurdists think that the human condition is essentially absurd because humans are always looking for meaning, but are completely unable to find meaning because no such meaning exists. In philosophy, this is called ‘the Absurd’. In this case absurd means that it is not possible to be done by humans. Absurdists, most notably Albert Camus, believe that when human beings realize this fundamental absurdity they have different reactions. One reaction is suicide, but this is not generally considered to be a viable solution by Absurdists; suicide is in and of itself the most absurd action possible. Another reaction is to believe in something higher (Camus gave religion as an example of this, although he went on to criticize its merit as a solution to fundamental absurdity) when they see that there is no meaning they can find in the universe (which is what absurdism says is the basic state of human experience). The final reaction is to accept the absurd, and also to keep trying to overcome it. Camus believed that a human being could become happy by finding meaning in their relationship with the absurdity of their existence. Perhaps the most notable absurdist philosopher is Albert Camus. Søren Kierkegaard's ideas contributed to the development of Absurdist philosophy, although he was himself an existentialist. ==References== ==Related pages== *Existential crisis *Nihilism Category:Philosophical movements and positions Category:Existentialist concepts Category:Philosophy of life",
