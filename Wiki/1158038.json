 "text": "142 (one hundred forty-two) is a whole number. It comes after 141 and before 143. == In mathematics == * Even number: 142 is an even number because it ends with a 2. * Composite number: 142 can be factored into 2×71. Both 2 and 71 are prime numbers, so 142 is also called a semiprime. * Not a palindrome: 142 reads as “one-four-two” forwards and “two-four-one” backwards, so it is not a palindromic number. * Not a Harshad number: The sum of its digits is 1+4+2=7. Since 142÷7≈20.2857 (not an integer), 142 is not a Harshad number. * Representations in different bases: ** In binary (base 2), 142 is written as 10001110. ** In octal (base 8), 142 is written as 216. ** In hexadecimal (base 16), 142 is written as 8E. == Other facts == * 142 is not a perfect square or a perfect cube. * Some roads, bus routes, or highways in different places may use the number 142.
