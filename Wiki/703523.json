Marr, Ltd., and contested the 1967 Memorial Cup, which they lost to the Toronto Marlboros. ==History== The Marrs played out of the Thunder Bay Junior Hockey League of Hockey Northwestern Ontario. They became the Thunder Bay Marrs in 1970 and then the Thunder Bay Case Eagles in 1971. The North Stars folded on July 6, 1980, when the TBAHA left them with no league to play in. ==Season-by-season standings== Season GP W L T OTL GF GA P Results 1925–26 16 5 11 0 - 53 89 10 3rd TBJHL 1926–27 18 2 16 0 -
