 "text": "Litoria hilli is a frog from New Guinea. Male adult frogs are about 43.6 to 49.4 mm long from nose to rear end and females are 53.8 to 54.7 cm long. Each frog has a spike on its nose and teeth on its upper jaw. Their front feet and hind feet are completely webbed and their toes have discs for climbing. Their skins are yellow-brown, red-brown or dark green. They can have yellow or purple marks. As of 2014, people had only seen Litoria hilli on one island in New Guinea, Sudest Island, and only on the west side of Mt. Rio. This is 130â€“410 meters above sea level. Adults lay eggs on leaves above small bodies of water. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
