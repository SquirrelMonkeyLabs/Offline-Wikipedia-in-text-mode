 "text": "WiiWare was a collection of games available to download on the Wii Shop Channel that were typically exclusive to the Nintendo Wii. WiiWare was usually only available on the Wii Shop Channel, just like how many Wii games were only available on Wii discs. WiiWare allowed small developers to release shorter sized and creative games, which usually took up more storage than Virtual Console games, which were also available on the Wii Shop Channel. WiiWare was first available in Japan on March 25, 2008, then in North America on May 12, 2008, and in Europe and Australia on May 19, 2008. Category:Wii",
