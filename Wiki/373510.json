 "text": "Chicago City Hall is the official city hall of the City of Chicago in Illinois, United States. Next to the Richard J. Daley Center and the James R. Thompson Center, the building that includes Chicago City Hall has the offices of the mayor. The building's east side (called the County Building) is for offices of Cook County. It is on a city block bounded by Randolph, LaSalle, Washington, and Clark streets. The 11-story building was designed by the architectural firm Holabird & Roche in the classical revival style. The building was officially dedicated on February 27, 1911. When this hall was being built, the city of Chicago was undergoing a massive transformation. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the city rebuild itself as an epicenter of commerce, culture, and industry. The City Hall was a direct reflection of this new, ambitious and modern Chicago. The City Hall is a transitional structure incorporating a mix of classical styles, 20th century materials and exquisite craftsmanship. The building's repeated use of large windows emphasizes its strong horizontal lines, and the beaux-arts style seems like an influence from the French Renaissance. The carved figures of eagles, lions and other symbolic elements evoke the imagery of power and protection. The central dome is symbolic of civic leadership owing to the fact that the building is the tallest structure for several blocks around. Chicago City Hall has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places as it a historical monument that signifies timeless elegance. Apart from its remarkable architectural and engineering feats, Chicago City Hall has also witnessed numerous significant political events, protests, and gatherings. ==References== ==Other websites== * City of Chicago * Cook County * Chicago Landmarks: City Hall-County Building Category:Buildings and structures in Chicago Category:Government of Chicago Category:1911 establishments in the United States Category:1910s establishments in Illinois",
