The pay-per-view was a collaboration with the Japanese puroresu promotion Wrestle-1. It was the tenth Bound for Glory event that TNA held and was also the fourth and last event in TNA's 2014 pay-per- view schedule. The event was aired on tape delay because of the time difference. Taz and Mike Tenay were not in Japan at the event and instead did commentary from TNA headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee. There were eight matches on the card. The main event saw The Great Muta and Tajiri defeat James Storm and The Great Sanada. ==Matches== # Results Stipulations Times 1 Minoru Tanaka defeated Manik by submission Singles match 9:53 2 Ethan Carter III defeated Ryota Hama Singles match 5:50 3 MVP defeated Kazma Sakamoto Singles match 8:07 4 Samoa Joe (c) defeated Low Ki and Kaz Hayashi by submission Three-way match for the TNA X Division Championship 10:32 5 Novus (Jiro Kuroshio and Yusuke Kodama) defeated Andy Wu and El Hijo del Pantera Tag team match 9:15 6 Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon) defeated Abyss and Tommy Dreamer Hardcore Tag Team match 12:53 7 Havok (c) defeated Velvet Sky by submission Singles match for the TNA Knockouts Championship 6:00 8 The Great Muta and Tajiri defeated James Storm and The Great Sanada Tag team match 10:56 (c) â€“ refers to the champion(s) heading into the match ==References== Category:2014 in professional wrestling Category:21st century in Tokyo Category:Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view events Category:2014 in Japan Category:October 2014 events",
