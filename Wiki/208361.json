There was conflict with the Mohawk during the Beaver Wars. As a result, many Mahicans moved to Massachusetts after 1680. They settled with tribes of the Lenape. Mahicans moved later to New York and joined the Oneida for several decades. The remaining descendants moved to northeastern Wisconsin during the 1820s and 1830s.\"Mohican\" (history), Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007, webpage: EB-Mohicans .\"Mahican\" (history), Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007, webpage: EB-Mahican.
