These students are considered to possess more advanced knowledge of the field that they study, as compared to those who only get a Master's degree. The course takes one year to complete, including at least four months of practical internship. == History == The history of the Mastère Spécialisé starts in 1986.

But a lot of foreign students sometimes came one entirely year in the French schools and came back to their own country without a degree. Also, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System was not yet adopted by all the schools.
