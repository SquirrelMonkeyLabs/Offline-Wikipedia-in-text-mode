It is in the central-eastern region of the country, on the southern shore of the Río de la Plata, in the Pampas region. The city was ceded in 1880 by the Province of Buenos Aires to be the federal capital of the country. It is the \"main capital\", along with 24 alternate capitals, because of the constitutional reform of 1994. Buenos Aires city is also known as Capital Federal to differentiate the city from the Buenos Aires Province. Until 1994 Buenos Aires city was under the presidential government, but after a constitutional reform in that year, the city became self-governed, allowing citizens to elect their city authorities. == Population == 3,040,000 people live in Buenos Aires. Spanish is the main language, but English is widely spoken and understood well. Italian is also widespread. == Climate == Buenos Aires has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). The average temperature is 17 °C.

It was the first major snowfall in the city in 89 years. ==Neighborhoods== Buenos Aires is divided into 48 neighborhoods.

A remarkable episode in the Argentine literature's history is the social and literary dialogue between the Florida Group, named this way because its members used to meet up at the Richmond Cafeteria at Florida street and publish their work in the Martin Fierro magazine, like Jorge Luis Borges, Leopoldo Marechal, Antonio Berni (artist), among others, versus the Boedo Group of Roberto Arlt, Manzi and other writers and artists. They used to meet together at the Japanese Cafe and published their works with the Editorial Claridad, with both the cafe and the publisher located at the Boedo Avenue. == Wikimania == The fifth Wikimania was hosted in this city in 2009. ==References== == Other websites == * Google Maps Satellite city View * Palo Santo Buenos Aires Guide * Buenos Aires Travel Guide * english.buenosaires.com - Tourism Portal * Official Tourism Website (English, Spanish, Portuguese and guides in ten different languages including Chinese, Japanese, French, German, Italian, etc.) === Online newspapers === * The Buenos Aires Herald Online edition of a local English language newspaper * La Nación * Infobae * La Prensa * Clarín",
