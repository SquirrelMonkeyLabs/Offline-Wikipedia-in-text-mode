 "text": "Lilacs and Roses is an oil painting on canvas by Édouard Manet. It was one of his late works, painted in 1883. It measures 54 × 45 cm. It is in a private collection. The painting is a development of the small vase of roses on the bar in Manet's The Bar at the Folies-Bergère. Many of Manet's later works offered a small still life in the lower left hand corner of the picture. The flowers present a \"cross\" shape that is broken by a diagonal line through the center. The brushwork is exceptional. The picture is one of the masterpieces of Manet's later years. == References == * Category:1880s paintings Category:Paintings by Édouard Manet Category:1883 works",
