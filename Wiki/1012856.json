 "text": "Sickness benefit was part of the Social Security system in the United Kingdom. It started with the National Insurance Act 1911. People had to get a sick note and they had to have paid enough National Insurance Contributions. It lasted for six months. After that people got Invalidity Benefit if they were still ill. That was more money. After 1983, most people got Statutory Sick Pay from their work for the first 8 weeks they were ill instead of sickness benefit. From 1986 Statutory Sick Pay lasted for 28 weeks, so people didn't get sickness benefit unless they couldn't get Statutory Sick Pay. In 1948, it was 26 shillings a week, but married women only got 16 shillings because they were expected to rely on their husband for money. In 1987, it was Â£30.05 a week for both men and women. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom",
