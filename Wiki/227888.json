 "text": "A chess tournament is a competition between chess players. It can take one of these forms: #A knock-out tournament. Not a popular choice in chess events. #An all-play-all event. A highly regarded format, but does not permit large entries. #A Swiss system event. Permits large entries, and is the most common format. The event has a pre-set number of rounds, and there are many more players than rounds. Progressively, players play opponents with roughly similar points to their own score. Players who win get stronger opponents, players who lose get weaker opponents. Pairing each round may be done by computer.Reuben, Stewart 2005.
