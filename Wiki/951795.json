 "text": "The Kinzua Dam is one of the largest dams east of the Mississippi River. It is along the Allegheny River in Warren County, Pennsylvania. It was created to control floods. The construction of the dam forced many Native American Seneca people off of their land. The Seneca lost a lot of farming land. They wrote a letter to John F. Kennedy to stop the dam. He refused. They lost the Cornplanter Tract.Kennedy, John F.
