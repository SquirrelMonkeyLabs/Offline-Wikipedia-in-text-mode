 "text": "In Australian Federal Politics the Leader of the Opposition is a Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives. The Leader of the Opposition is usually the leader of the party which has the most seats but is not part of the Government. In Parliament the Leader of the Opposition sits on the left- hand side of the table in the centre, in front of the Opposition and opposite the Prime Minister. The Opposition Leader is elected by the Opposition Party. A new Opposition Leader may be elected if the person in the position dies, resigns or is challenged for the leadership. The Commonwealth of Australia is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. It is based on the British Westminster model. The term Opposition has a specific meaning in the parliamentary system. Its formal title is Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. This is an important part of the Westminster system. The Opposition directs its criticism at the Government and attempts to defeat and replace the Government. The Opposition is therefore the 'Government in waiting' and it is a formal part of the parliamentary system, just as is the Government. It is in opposition to the Government, but not to the Crown, hence the term 'Loyal Opposition'. The current Leader of the Opposition is Sussan Ley since 13 May 2025, following the Liberal Party's defeat in the 2025 federal election. ==List of leaders of the opposition== No. Leader Party Constituency Took office Left office Prime Minister Ref 1 George Reid Free Trade East Sydney (NSW) 19 May 1901 17 August 1904 Barton 1901–03 Deakin 1903–04 Watson 1904 2 Chris Watson Labor Bland (NSW) 18 August 1904 5 July 1905 Reid 1904–05 (1) George Reid Free Trade / Anti-Socialist East Sydney (NSW) 7 July 1905 16 November 1908 Deakin 1905–08 Fisher 1908–09 3 Joseph Cook Anti- Socialist Parramatta (NSW) 17 November 1908 26 May 1909 4 Alfred Deakin Liberal Ballaarat (Vic) 26 May 1909 2 June 1909 5 Andrew Fisher Labor Wide Bay (Qld) 2 June 1909 29 April 1910 Deakin 1909 (4) Alfred Deakin Liberal Ballaarat (Vic) 1 July 1910 20 January 1913 Fisher 1910–13 (3) Joseph Cook Parramatta (NSW) 20 January 1913 24 June 1913 (5) Andrew Fisher Labor Wide Bay (Qld) 8 July 1913 17 September 1914 Cook 1913–14 (3) Joseph Cook Liberal Parramatta (NSW) 8 October 1914 17 February 1917 Fisher 1914–15 Hughes 1915–23 6 Frank Tudor Labor Yarra (Vic) 17 February 1917 10 January 1922 7 Matthew Charlton Hunter (NSW) 25 January 1922 29 March 1928 Bruce 1923–29 8 James Scullin Yarra (Vic) 29 March 1928 22 October 1929 9 John Latham Nationalist Kooyong (Vic) 20 November 1929 7 May 1931 Scullin 1929–32 10 Joseph Lyons United Australia Wilmot (Tas) 7 May 1931 6 January 1932 (8) James Scullin Labor Yarra (Vic) 6 January 1932 1 October 1935 Lyons 1932–39 11 John Curtin Fremantle (WA) 1 October 1935 7 October 1941 Page 1939 Menzies 1939–41 Fadden 1941 12 Arthur Fadden Country Darling Downs (Qld) 7 October 1941 23 September 1943 Curtin 1941–45 13 Robert Menzies United Australia Kooyong (Vic) 23 September 1943 19 December 1949 Liberal Forde 1945 Chifley 1945–49 14 Ben Chifley Labor Macquarie (NSW) 19 December 1949 13 June 1951 Menzies 1949–66 15 H.
