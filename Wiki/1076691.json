 "text": "Raging Waters Sydney, formerly called Wet'n'Wild Sydney, is a waterpark in the suburb of Prospect in Greater Western Sydney. The park was announced in 2010, began construction in 2011 and was officially opened in 2013. It originally owned by Village Roadshow Theme Parks (who own three theme parks on the Gold Coast), who used the same brand as Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast and several other Wet'n'Wild waterparks around the world. In 2018, the park was bought by a Spanish company, Parques Reunidos, who renamed it Raging Waters in 2019. The park is the only one outside the United States that is owned and operated by Palace Entertainment, which currently owns 25 attractions (including amusement parks, waterparks and zoos) and hotels across the United States. ==References== Category:Sydney",
