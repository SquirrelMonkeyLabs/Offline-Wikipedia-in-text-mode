Arnheuser-Bush is among the biggest breweries in the world, and Bud/Bud Light is very popular in the United States. As a result, the issue is also called Bud Light fiasco. Arnheuser-Bush wanted to attract younger people. They ran an advertising campaign featuring Dylan Mulvaney. Mulvaney is a transgender woman and a transgender activist. During a festival, known as the March Madness, Mulvaney starred in an advertisement for Bud Light. Many conservatives were against the video.
