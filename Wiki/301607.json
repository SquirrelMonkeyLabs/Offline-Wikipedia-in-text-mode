 "text": "Kubla Khan is a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He wrote it in 1797, and it was published in 1816. It is a poem from the Romantic era, a time when people often made art about nature and emotions. Coleridge said that he wrote the poem after a dream he had, while on opium. He said that he was interrupted by a person from Porlock while he was writing it, and never got to finish it. Some people say that this is not completely true. The first stanza of the poem describes a pleasure dome and a river called Alph, and the second stanza talks about an Abyssinian maid. Category:18th-century British poems Category:1790s works",
