 "text": "The 2003 Pacific hurricane season saw an strangely big number of tropical cyclones affect Mexico. The biggest cyclones in 2003 were Hurricanes Ignacio (which killed 2 people in Mexico) and Marty (which killed 12 people in Mexico). Those hurricanes were responsible for nearly $1 billion (2003 USD) in damage. Three other Pacific storms and three Atlantic storms also affected Mexico. The only other big storm of the season was Hurricane Jimena. Hurricane Jimena passed just to the south of Hawaii. Hurricane Jimena was the first storm to go near Hawaii for several years. The season officially started on May 15, 2003 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 2003 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2003. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season saw 16 tropical storms form, which is about average. However, this season was the first Pacific hurricane season since 1977 to have no systems become major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. == Storms == === Hurricane Marty === Marty killed 12 and destroyed 4,000 homes in Baja California. === Hurricane Nora === Hurricane Nora was the strongest hurricane in the eastern Pacific Ocean in 2003. === Other Storms === *Tropical Storm Andres *Tropical Storm Blanca *Tropical Storm Carlos *Tropical Storm Dolores *Tropical Storm Enrique *Tropical Storm Felicia *Tropical Storm Guillermo *Tropical Storm Hilda *Tropical Depression One-C *Hurricane Ignacio *Hurricane Jimena *Tropical Storm Kevin *Hurricane Linda *Hurricane Olaf *Hurricane Patricia == Other websites == * NHC 2003 Pacific hurricane season archive * HPC 2003 Tropical Cyclone Rainfall Pages * Central Pacific Hurricane Center 2003 season summary * Mariners Weather Log: Summary of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season Category:Pacific hurricane seasons Pacific hurricane season",
