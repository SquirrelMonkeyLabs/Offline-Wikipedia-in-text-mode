 "text": "The Carcharodontosauridae were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs. They are a clade in the Carnosauria. Carcharodontosaurids included three of the most famous land predators ever known to science: Giganotosaurus, Eocarcharia and Concavenator. All of these predators were smaller than the more popular Tyrannosaurus in size. ==Evolution== Together with the spinosaurids, carcharodontosaurids were the largest predators in the early and middle Cretaceous throughout Gondwana. They were also in North America, and Asia.Brusatte S. et al 2009. The first definitive carcharodontosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from Asia and the delayed ascent of tyrannosaurids. Naturwissenschaften, PMID 19488730 Lesser-known carcharodontosaurs included Carcharodontosaurus and Acrocanthosaurus. Their ages range from 127 to 93 million years ago (mya). After that, they may have been replaced by the smaller abelisaurids in Gondwana and by tyrannosaurids in North America and Asia. If so, this faunal replacement occurred on a global scale.Novas, de Valais, Vickers-Rich, and Rich. 2005. A large Cretaceous theropod from Patagonia, Argentina, and the evolution of carcharodontosaurids. Naturwissenschaften, However, some theropod teeth discovered in the late Cretaceous of Brazil, as well as a fragment of right maxilla appear to belong to carcharodontosaurids. This suggests the group survived until the latest Cretaceous. In December 2011, Oliver Rauhut described a new genus and species of carcharodontosaurid from the Upper Jurassic during the late Kimmeridgian to earliest Tithonian, about 154150 mya of southeastern Tanzania. == References == Category:Carnosaurs",
