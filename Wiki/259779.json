 "text": "Brian David Josephson, FRS (born 4 January 1940; Cardiff, Wales ) is a Welsh physicist who became a Nobel laureate in 1973. He is of Jewish descent. As of late 2007, he was a retired professor at the University of Cambridge, where he is the head of the Mindâ€“Matter Unification Project in the Theory of Condensed Matter (TCM) research group. He is also a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Josephson is one of the more well-known scientists who say that parapsychological phenomena may be real, and is also interested in the possibility that Eastern mysticism may have relevance to scientific understanding. In 2005, Josephson said that \"parapsychology should now have become a conventional field of research, and yet parapsychology's claims are still not generally accepted\". He compared this situation to that of Alfred Wegener's hypothesis of continental drift, where there was initially great resistance to acceptance despite the strength of the evidence. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:British Nobel Prize winners Category:British physicists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Jewish British academics Category:Jewish British scientists Category:Jewish Nobel Prize winners Category:British parapsychologists Category:People from Cardiff",
