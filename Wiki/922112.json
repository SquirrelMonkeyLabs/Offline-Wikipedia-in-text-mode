 "text": "The Santa Cecilia humming frog (Chiasmocleis anatipes) is a species of frog. It is in the family Microhylidae. It is from northeastern Ecuador. It lives in parts of Peru and Colombia too. The species name anatipes is from its \"duck- like\" feet. Scientists have seen it between 200 and 400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 18.0 to 19.4 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 25.0 to 30.0 mm long. It lives in primary and secondary forest. It lives in the same area as other frogs with the same ancestor frog: Chiasmocleis bassleri and Ctenophryne geayi. It looks for food at night. People tend to see them sitting on plants no more than 25 cm above the ground. When it is time to lay eggs, the male frogs go to ponds. They sing together for the female frogs. The female frogs lay eggs near the surface of the water. The tadpoles swim alone near the surface of the water during the day. Scientsts found red ants in the stomach of one humming frog. They think this frog eats ants. == References == Category:Frogs of South America",
