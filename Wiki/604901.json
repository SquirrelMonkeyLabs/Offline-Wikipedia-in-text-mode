 "text": "The Normandy landings (codenamed Operation Neptune) were the landings on Tuesday, June 6, 1944, during World War II. Invasion forces landed at Gold Beach, Sword Beach, Omaha Beach, Juno Beach, Pointe du Hoc, and Utah Beach. The Allies of World War II: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and other countries landed, starting on the designated D-Day (military term). The whole invasion was codenamed \"Operation Overlord\" and was intended to open the Western Front in the war. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was the commander of Overlord. After the landing, the Allied forces failed to take any of the planned towns and places. However, they controlled the beaches, and in the following days, they moved inland. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead. The Normandy landings were the largest and deadliest amphibious invasion in history. == Other websites == * The Normandy Invasion at the US Army Center of Military History * Neptune Operations Plan * Naval details for Overlord at Naval-History.Net * Quiz questions * Documents on D-Day: The Invasion of Normandy at the Eisenhower Presidential Center Category:Invasions of World War II Category:June 1944 events Category:1944 in France",
