 "text": "The Freedom Caucus, also known as the House Freedom Caucus, is a congressional caucus. It includes Republican members of the United States House of Representatives. == History == The caucus started during the mid–January 2015 Republican congressional retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Founding member Mick Mulvaney said, \"that was the first time we got together and decided we were a group, and not just a bunch of pissed-off guys\". Nine conservative Republican members of the House began planning a new congressional caucus separate from the Republican Study Committee and the House Republican Conference. The first board of directors for the new caucus were Republican representatives Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Jim Jordan of Ohio, John Fleming of Louisiana, Matt Salmon of Arizona, Justin Amash of Michigan, Raúl Labrador of Idaho, Mulvaney of South Carolina, Ron DeSantis of Florida and Mark Meadows of North Carolina. == Other websites == *https://www.pewresearch.org/short- reads/2023/01/23/freedom-caucus-likely-to-play-a-bigger-role-in-new-gop-led- house-so-who-are-they/ *https://www.legistorm.com/organization/summary/128166/House_Freedom_Caucus.html Category:Republican Party (United States) Category:2015 establishments in the United States",
