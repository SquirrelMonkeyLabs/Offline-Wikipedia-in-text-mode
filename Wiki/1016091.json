 "text": "The large warted tree frog, Gordon's bug-eyed frog, or Gordon's warty frog (Theloderma gordoni) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar. This frog lives in forests on mountains where there is karst rock in the ground. People have seen this frog between 600 and 1500 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs in holes in trees that have water in them and in pools of water in the karst rock. This frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out soon, but it is in some danger. People change the places where the frog lives to get wood to build with and make farms, especially for plants to sell, for example coffee, tea, and rubber. People might catch this frog to sell as a pet. This frog's home has protected parks in it, for example Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, Ta Sua Nature Reserve, and Doi Suthep National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
