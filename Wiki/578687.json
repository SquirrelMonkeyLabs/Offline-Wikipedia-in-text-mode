As a member of the South African Communist Party he was active in the struggle against apartheid and was imprisoned along with other key members of the anti-apartheid movement such as Nelson Mandela at Robben Island. After the first non-racial elections in South Africa, Goldberg founded the development organisation Community H.E.A.R.T. in London in 1995 to help to improve the living standards of black South Africans. With the support of German friends, he established Community H.E.A.R.T. e.V. in Essen, Germany in 1996. Goldberg returned to South Africa in 2002 and was appointed Special Adviser to MP Ronnie Kasrils, Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry until 2004.
