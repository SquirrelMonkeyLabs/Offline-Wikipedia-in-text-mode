 "text": "The South Africa women's national soccer team (), known as Banyana Banyana (The Girls), represents South Africa in international women's soccer. It is managed by the South African Football Association. They have participated in two Olympic Games, two FIFA Women's World Cups, and 14 Women's African Cup of Nations. They were the second-best team five times before finally winning it once. They've also taken part in all 10 COSAFA Women's Championships, winning seven times, coming second twice, and finishing fourth once. Banyana Banyana's very first official match was on 30th May 1993 against Swaziland, which they won 14–0. Desiree Ellis, who later became the coach of the winning Women's AFCON team, played in that game and scored three goals. Their first international match outside Africa was against China, and they played two matches, losing 8-0 and 13–0, with the latter being their heaviest defeat. Their first victory against a non-African nation was in 2000 when they beat Scotland 2–0. This happened at the Cyrus Women's Cup. South Africa's biggest win was in a COSAFA Women's Championship match in Gqeberha on 31st July 2019 when they defeated Comoros 17–0. Captain Refiloe Jane scored four of the goals. == References == Category:African women's national association football teams Category:Football in South Africa Category:National sports teams of South Africa",
