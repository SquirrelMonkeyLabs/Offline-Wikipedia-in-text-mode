 "text": "A tangerine is citrus fruit related to the mandarin orange. Tangerines are smaller and easier to peel than common oranges. The taste is considered less sour, but sweeter and stronger, than that of an orange. Very often, tangerines are simply peeled and eaten by hand, but they are sometimes also used as an ingredient of salads. In Sichuan cuisine, the dried peel of tangerines is used as an ingredient. Clementines are sometimes considered as alternatives to tangerines. ==References== Category:Citrus",
