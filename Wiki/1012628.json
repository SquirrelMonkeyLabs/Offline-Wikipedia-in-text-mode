 "text": "The Malaya bug-eyed frog (Theloderma leporosum) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia and Indonesia. This frog lives in forests with evergreen trees in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that were cut down but have had a long time to grow back. People see them sitting in holes in trees 3 m above the ground. Scientists believe these frogs need very large holes in trees to lay eggs, and that these holes are only in older forests. People have seen this frog between 800 and 1200 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. There is some danger because human beings cut down trees to get wood to build with and make farms, for example for tea and fruit. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Gunung Stong State Park and Sibolangit Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
