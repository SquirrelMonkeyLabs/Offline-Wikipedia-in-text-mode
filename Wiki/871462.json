 "text": "The Disney Renaissance was an era of Disney animated features from 1989 to 1999 when Disney made movies that were successful with critics and audiences. Between the years 1989 and 1994 came The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). These films earned Oscar nominations and wins. The Rescuers Down Under (1990) is the only film of Disney Renaissance that bombed at the box office. Later Disney animated films released in the mid to late 1990s included Pocahontas (1995), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Hercules (1997), Mulan (1998), and Tarzan (1999).
