 "text": "Egbert (also spelt Ecgberht) (–839) was King of Wessex from 802 until 839. In the 780s Egbert was forced into exile by King Offa of Mercia and King Beorhtric of Wessex, but on Beorhtric's death in 802 Egbert returned and took the throne. He was the father of King Athelwulf of Wessex. == Early career == Egbert was the son of Ealhmund, King of Kent.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 207 He was descended from Ingeld, brother of King Ine of Wessex.Asser's Life of King Alfred, Trans. L.C. Jane (London: Chatto & Windus, 1926), p. 1 In 786 he made a bid for the throne of Wessex after the death of King Cynewulf of Wessex.Mike Ashley, The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens (New york: Carroll & Graf, 1999), p. 313 Offa of Mercia however, made Beorhtric king instead. As a youth, Egbert was seen as a problem for Beorhtric who didn't want Egbert in England. While Beorhtric was negotiating to marry Offa's daughter he asked that Egbert be handed over to him. While Offa was considering doing just that, Egbert fled Mercia and at some point left England. He appears to have been welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years, but possibly up to thirteen years. This is at the time when Frankish ports were closed to English ships and trading because in 789, Charlemagne made an agreement with Offa to marry his son Charles to one of Offa’s daughters, but Offa made it a condition that his son Ecgfrith should marry one of Charlemagne’s daughters. Charlemagne was so offended by this he suspended trade relations with England. While at the Frankish court Egbert married a noblewoman, Redburga.James Panton, Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2011), p. 389 She was possibly a close relative of Charlemagne.Mike Ashley, The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens (New york: Carroll & Graf, 1999), p. 314 Egbert and Redburga had a son born in Francia, Athelwulf, in about 795. In 802 Beorhtric died and Egbert returned to become King of Wessex, probably with military aid from Charlemagne. == King of Wessex == His first few years as king are not well recorded. It is very probable that he used this time to reorganize his army and his administration. Egbert formed an alliance with Wulfred, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 815 Egbert invaded Cornwall and brought it under his rule. He allowed sub-kings to rule it for him. In 825 the new king of Mercia, Beornwulf, invaded Wessex. Beornwulf had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex. In what Frank Stenton called \"one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history\" Egbert defeated Beornwulf.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 231 This was the end of the Mercian kings dominating England. Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub- king.Barbara Yorke, Wessex in the early Middle Ages (London; New York: Leicester University Press, 1995), p. 94 As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert. Beornwulf tried to recover East Anglia later the same year and was killed in the attempt. Kent, Surrey and Sussex remained a part of the kingdom of Wessex from this time on. Essex was later lost to the Danes.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 233 Egbert appointed his son Athelwulf as sub-king of Kent which included all the new territories of Wessex. Egbert then defeated all of Mercia in 829. The king of Northumbria submitted to him after the defeat of Mercia. He assumed the title (King of Mercia). This title was also on coins made in the former Mercian port of London.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 232 In 830 Wiglaf returned to power in Mercia, but the gains of Kent and southwest England remained with Wessex. Egbert died 4 February 839.Detlev Schwennicke, Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten, Neue Folge, Band II (Marburg, Germany: J. A. Stargardt, 1984), Tafel 78 He left a territory larger than any other Wessex king since Ine.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 235 He was the bretwalda or overlord of Anglo-Saxon England until Wiglaf returned in 830. Even so, he remained the most powerful king during his time. == Family == Together he and Redburga had: * Athelwulf, who succeeded his father.Asser's Life of King Alfred, Trans. L.C.
