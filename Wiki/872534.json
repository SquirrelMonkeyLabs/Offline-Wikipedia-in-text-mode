 "text": "Magna Carta (An Embroidery) is an embroidery of the English Wikipedia article for Magna Carta. It was made in 2015 by artist Cornelia Parker. It was made to celebrate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta. Parker used 87 pieces of fabric and gave them to people around the United Kingdom. More than 200 people worked on the embroidery. Most of the text was stitched by prisoners and the pictures were done by people in the Embroiderers' Guild. Jurists, activists, and artists helped with the stitching. Many of them stitched words that they liked. Students from La Retraite Roman Catholic Girls' School were the youngest people to work on the embroidery. == References == Category:Works about Wikipedia Category:2015",
