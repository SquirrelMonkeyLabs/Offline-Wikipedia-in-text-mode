 "text": "\"Hot 'N' Heavy\" is a song by the American heavy metal band Pantera. It's the opening track on the album I Am the Night. It was released as the band's first ever single on December 7, 1985. It was also the band's second music video. The band's first home video, The Hot 'n Heavy Home Vid, was named after the song. Despite its name, the titular track is not present. The songs included are \"All Over Tonight\", \"Come on Eyes\" and \"Heavy Metal Rules.\" The home video came on a VHS and is considered rare. AllMusic writer Eduardo Rivadavia called the song a decent album opener. His only complaint with it are Terry Lee Glaze's vocals. He described them as \"screechy yelps.\" ==Track listing== All tracks are written by Pantera ;Single ;Home video ==References== Category:Pantera songs Category:1985 songs",
