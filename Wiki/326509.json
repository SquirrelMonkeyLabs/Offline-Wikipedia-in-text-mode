 "text": "T-Mobile Park is a baseball park in Seattle, Washington. It is the home field of the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. It opened in 1999, and it replaced the Mariners' old stadium, the Kingdome. The stadium opened as Safeco Field, with the locally based Safeco Insurance signing a 20-year contract to place its name on the stadium. With the contract ending after the 2018 season, Safeco chose not to renew it. The team then signed a new 25-year naming rights contract with wireless carrier T-Mobile US, the main American arm of German telecom giant Deutsche Telekom. The new name took effect on January 1, 2019. == Sources == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
