The plant will cost 310 million euros and is currently under construction. Andasol will have a generating capacity of 50 megawatts and liquid salt heat storage will allow for electricity to be generated for seven hours after the sun has gone down. Annual electricity production will be 179 gigawatt hours which will cover the electricity demands of 50,000 households or 200,000 people. Andasol should be completed in mid-2008 and a second plant, Andasol 2, is planned. ==Related pages== * List of Solar thermal power stations * Renewable energy * Solar power in Spain == References == == Other websites == * Pictures Category:Solar power plants Category:Buildings and structures in Spain Category:Province of Granada Category:2009 establishments in Europe Category:2000s establishments in Spain",
