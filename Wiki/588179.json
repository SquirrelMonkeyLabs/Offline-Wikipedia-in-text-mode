 "text": "Polyisocyanurate is a thermoset plastic. It is also called PIR, polyiso, or ISO. It is usually made as a foam. It is used as rigid thermal insulation. It is similar to polyurethane (PUR) except that the proportion of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate is higher and a polyester-derived polyol is used in the reaction instead of a polyether polyol. Catalysts and additives used are also different from those used in PUR. == References == ==Other websites== *Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association *Polyisocyanurate Insulation energy savings, by Center for the Polyurethanes Industry Category:Polymers",
