 "text": "A Whitley council, also known as a joint industrial council, is a British organization which fixes wage rates, terms and conditions in a specific industry. They have both employers and trade unions. They were started in 1917. In 1979 there were eight councils in the National Health Service covering all the NHS staff, except doctors and dentists. In 2004 a new system was started for the NHS, called Agenda for Change. It has nine numbered pay bands subdivided into points, like the old alphabetic Whitley Council 'grades' pay scales. ==References== Category:Organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Employment law",
