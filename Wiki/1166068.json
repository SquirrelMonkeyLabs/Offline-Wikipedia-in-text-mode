 "text": "The Prohibition on Alcohol was firstly implemented in 1954 by Morarji Desai who was Chief Minister of Bombay Province. The Prohibition was imposed on the Koli people who were traditional distillers of alcohol or wine in Maharashtra mostly in Dharavi. Kolis of Bombay distilled the alcohol by Jamun, Guava, Orange, Apple and Chikoo. In 1954, Morarji Desai imposed the Prohibition on liquor but there was a strong protest by Koli community and there were rallies far and wide by Koli people. Kolis alleged the Desai that 'This is not a Daru- Bandi, This is Desh-Bandi' , due to the Desai administration's allowance on the selling the foreign alcohol in state and prohibitions on homemade liquor. before the prohibition on alcohol, Kolis of Dharavi manufactured the alcohol legally and when prohibition enacted, commercial alcohol production ceased and Kolis had a virtual monopoly in this area. == References == Category:Alcoholic drinks",
