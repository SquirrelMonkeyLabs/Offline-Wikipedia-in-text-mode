 "text": "The Nauli bubble-nest frog (Rohanixalus nauli) is a frog. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Teluk Nauli in Indonesia. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and forests that are growing back. It is good at living in places that have been changed. People have seen this frog between 900 and 1000 meters above sea level. This frog lives on Mount Sinabung. ==Young== Scientists do not know where this frog lays its eggs. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Mt. Sinabung is a volcano. When it erupts, it puts out ashes and melted rock that can kill many frogs and other living things. The eruptions also make rocks fall. Mt. Sinabung erupted in 2010 and never stopped all the way. There was a big eruption in 2017. Scientists also see that people build farms for palm oil, small farms, and places for animals to eat grass in the forests where the frog lives. This could hurt the frog too. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
