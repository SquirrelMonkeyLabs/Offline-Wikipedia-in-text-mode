 "text": "The James Norris Memorial Trophy is given out to the National Hockey League's best \"defense player who demonstrates throughout the season the greatest all- round ability in the position\". The James Norris Memorial Trophy has been awarded 53 times to 22 different players since it was first created in 1954. At the end of each season, members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association vote to decide the player who was the best defenseman during the regular season. ==History== The trophy is named in honour of James E. Norris, owner of the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings from 1932 to 1952. The trophy was first awarded at the end of the 1953–54 NHL season. Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins won the award for a record eight seasons in a row (1968–75). Doug Harvey and Nicklas Lidström has won the award seven times, while Ray Bourque has won it five times during his career. The Boston Bruins have won the most Norris Trophies with 14. The Montreal Canadiens are second with 11. There are only two players that have won both the Norris and Hart Memorial Trophy for the same season: Bobby Orr, who won both trophies for the 1969–70, 1970–71 and 1971–72 seasons, and Chris Pronger, who won the Hart and Norris for the 1999–2000 NHL season. Seven different defensemen won the Hart Trophy before the Norris Trophy's establishment: Billy Burch, Eddie Shore (four times), Herb Gardiner, Albert \"Babe\" Siebert, Ebbie Goodfellow, Tommy Anderson and Babe Pratt. The voting is done at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association, and each voter picks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL awards ceremony after the end of the playoffs. ==Winners== Season Winner Team Win # 1953–54 Detroit Red Wings 1 1954–55 Montreal Canadiens 1 1955–56 Montreal Canadiens 2 1956–57 Montreal Canadiens 3 1957–58 Montreal Canadiens 4 1958–59 Montreal Canadiens 1 1959–60 Montreal Canadiens 5 1960–61 Montreal Canadiens 6 1961–62 New York Rangers 7 1962–63 Chicago Black Hawks 1 1963–64 Chicago Black Hawks 2 1964–65 Chicago Black Hawks 3 1965–66 Montreal Canadiens 1 1966–67 New York Rangers 1 1967–68 Boston Bruins 1 1968–69 Boston Bruins 2 1969–70 Boston Bruins 3 1970–71 Boston Bruins 4 1971–72 Boston Bruins 5 1972–73 Boston Bruins 6 1973–74 Boston Bruins 7 1974–75 Boston Bruins 8 1975–76 New York Islanders 1 1976–77 Montreal Canadiens 1 1977–78 New York Islanders 2 1978–79 New York Islanders 3 1979–80 Montreal Canadiens 2 1980–81 Pittsburgh Penguins 1 1981–82 Chicago Black Hawks 1 1982–83 Washington Capitals 1 1983–84 Washington Capitals 2 1984–85 Edmonton Oilers 1 1985–86 Edmonton Oilers 2 1986–87 Boston Bruins 1 1987–88 Boston Bruins 2 1988–89 Montreal Canadiens 1 1989–90 Boston Bruins 3 1990–91 Boston Bruins 4 1991–92 New York Rangers 1 1992–93 Chicago Blackhawks 2 1993–94 Boston Bruins 5 1994–95 Detroit Red Wings 3 1995–96 Chicago Blackhawks 3 1996–97 New York Rangers 2 1997–98 Los Angeles Kings 1 1998–99 St. Louis Blues 1 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues 1 2000–01 Detroit Red Wings 1 2001–02 Detroit Red Wings 2 2002–03 Detroit Red Wings 3 2003–04 New Jersey Devils 1 2004–05 zzz — — 2005–06 Detroit Red Wings 4 2006–07 Detroit Red Wings 5 2007–08 Detroit Red Wings 6 2008–09 Boston Bruins 1 2009–10 Chicago Blackhawks 1 2010–11 Detroit Red Wings 7 2011–12 Ottawa Senators 1 2012–13 Montreal Canadiens 1 2013–14 Chicago Blackhawks 2 2014–15 Ottawa Senators 2 2015–16 Los Angeles Kings 1 2016–17 San Jose Sharks 1 2017–18 Tampa Bay Lightning 1 2018–19 Calgary Flames 1 2019–20 Nashville Predators 1 2020–21 New York Rangers 1 2021–22 Colorado Avalanche 1 2022–23 San Jose Sharks 3 2023–24 Vancouver Canucks 1 ==Related pages== *List of NHL players *List of NHL statistical leaders ==References== ;General *James Norris Memorial Trophy history at NHL.com *James Norris Memorial Trophy history at Legends of Hockey.net ;Specific Category:National Hockey League trophies and awards",
