Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before committing suicide. It is the deadliest mass shooting in British history. Later, and influenced by this event, two new Firearms Acts were passed. They greatly restricted private ownership of firearms in Great Britain. == Sources == *https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public- inquiry-into-the-shootings-at-dunblane-primary-school Category:1996 in the United Kingdom Category:1990s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1990s murders in Europe Category:1990s in Scotland Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in the 1990s Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in the United Kingdom Category:Attacks on schools in Europe Category:March 1996 events Category:Mass murder in 1996 Category:Mass shootings in Europe Category:Mass shootings in the 1990s Category:Massacres in the United Kingdom Category:Murder in Scotland Category:Murder-suicides in Europe Category:Murders by firearm in the United Kingdom Category:School shootings in Europe",
