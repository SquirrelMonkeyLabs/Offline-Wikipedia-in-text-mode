 "text": "The fourteenth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who premiered on 11 May 2024, and aired through to 22 June. The series is also known as \"Season One\" following the production changes and the acquisition of Doctor Whos international broadcasting rights by Disney+. It is the fifth series led by Russell T Davies as head writer and executive producer and the first since his return to the show, having previously worked on it from 2005 to 2010. This series is the fourteenth to air since the programme's revival in 2005, and the fortieth season overall. The fourteenth series was announced with Davies' return for its 60th anniversary in 2023 and beyond, with Bad Wolf becoming a co-producer. The series is the first to star Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor, a new incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in the TARDIS, which appears to be a British police box from the outside. The Fifteenth Doctor was introduced in \"The Giggle\" (2023) through a \"bi-generation\", in which he split from his predecessor, the Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant), rather than replacing him. The series also introduces Millie Gibson as the Doctor's newest companion, Ruby Sunday. Preceded by a Christmas episode on 25 December 2023, the series consists of eight episodes directed by Julie Anne Robinson, Ben Chessell, Dylan Holmes Williams, and Jamie Donoughue. Alongside Davies, who wrote six of the episodes, the writers are Kate Herron, Briony Redman, and former showrunner and head writer Steven Moffat. Filming began in December 2022 and concluded in July 2023. It was the first series to be produced at Wolf Studios Wales, following the move from Roath Lock Studios for the preceding anniversary specials. Reviews for the series were mostly positive, although some criticized the resolution to the series' story arc. == Cast == === Main === * Ncuti Gatwa as The Fifteenth Doctor * Millie Gibson as Ruby Sunday * Nicola Coughlan as Joy Almondo === Recurring === * Michelle Greenidge as Carla Sunday * Angela Wynter as Cherry Sunday * Jemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart * Bonnie Langsford as Melanie Bush * Lenny Rush as Morris Gibbons * Nicholas Briggs as Voice of the Vlinx * Aidan Cook as The Vlinx * Yasmin Finney as Rose Noble === Guest === *Davina McCall *Bobby Bradley – Denzel *Mary Malone – Trudy *Belinda Owusu – Woman with Pram *Barney Wilkinson – Policeman *Anita Dobson – Mrs Flood *Hemi Yeroham – Abdul *Michelle Greenidge – Carla Sunday *Angela Wynter – Cherry Sunday *Gemma Arrowsmith – Ruth Lyons *Rachelle Beinart, Jess Judge, Dilu Miah, Giuseppe Lentini, Andrew Francis, Lukas Disparrow – Goblins *Susan Twist – Heckler (uncredited) *Golda Rosheuvel – Jocelyn Sancerre *Michelle Greenidge – Carla Sunday *Angela Wynter – Cherry Sunday *Mason McCumskey – Eric *Sami Amber – Voice of Eric *Sienna-Robyn Mavanga-Phipps – Poppy *Shola Olaitan-Ajiboye – Voice of Poppy *Cadence Williams – Voice of Sandra *Param Patel – Voice of Marcel *Lonnee Archibong – Voice of Adjani *Jesus Reyes Ortiz – Rico Trieste *Yasmine Bouabid – Lucia Colasanto *Robert Strange – Bogeyman *Susan Twist – Comms Officer Gina Scalzi (uncredited) *Jinkx Monsoon – Maestro *Jeremy Limb – Timothy Drake *Kit Rakusen – Henry *Sherinne Kayra Anderson – Tea Trolley Lady *Ed White – George Martin *George Caple – Paul McCartney *Chris Mason – John Lennon *Philip Davies – George Harrison *James Hoyles – Ringo Starr *Chan Shoker – Studio Producer *Josie Sedgwick-Davies – Cilla Black *Susan Twist – Tea Lady *Simon Jason-Smith – Vinnie *Laura June Hudson – Elderly Woman *Murray Gold – Himself *Shirley Ballas – Herself *Johannes Radebe – Himself *Joe Anderson – John Francis Vater *Majid Mehdizadeh-Valoujerdy – Carson *Caoilinn Springall – Splice Alison Vater *Varada Sethu – Mundy Flynn *Bhav Joshi – Canterbury James Olliphant *Susan Twist – Ambulance *Hilary Hobson – The Woman *Susan Twist – Hiker *Maxine Evans – Lowri Palin *Siân Phillips – Enid Meadows *Sion Pritchard – Joshua Steele *Gwion Morris Jones – Ifor Jones *Elan Davies – Thin Lucy *Glyn Pritchard – Eddie Jones *Anita Dobson – Mrs Flood *Graham Butler – Frank Hinchey *Ali Ariaie – Sanjay Miah *Albey Brookes – Rufus Bray *Aneurin Barnard – Roger ap Gwilliam *Miles Yekinni – Craig Deloach *Amol Rajan – Himself *Sophie Ablett – Marti Bridges *Shane David-Joseph – Akhim Patil *Jason May – Groundsman *Dylan Baldwin – Security Officer *David Constant – Armed Policeman *Deeviya Meir – Newsreader *Amanda Walker – Old Ruby *Rhyanna Alexander-Davis – Elizabeth Campbell *Vee Vimolmal – Nurse *Paul Forman – Lord Barton *Maxim Ays – Lord Galpin *Indira Varma – Duchess of Pemberton *Jonathan Groff – Rogue *Camilla Aiko – Emily Beckett *Debra Baker – Housekeeper *Ashley Campbell – Butler *Nancy Brabin-Platt – Miss Talbot *David Charles – Mr Price *Susan Twist – Portrait (uncredited) *Richard E.
