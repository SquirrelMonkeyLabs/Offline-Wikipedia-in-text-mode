 "text": "A swimsuit, bathing suit (sometimes shortened to bathers), or swimming costume (sometimes shortened to cozzie) is clothing designed to be worn for swimming. Swimming trunks are a pair of shorts or briefs worn for swimming or bathing. In New Zealand English and some areas of Australian English, swimsuits are usually called togs. This term is less common in other parts of the English- speaking world where it may refer to clothes in general. Swimsuits can be skin-tight or loosely fitting. They range from garments designed to preserve as much modesty as possible to garments designed to reveal as much of the body as possible without actual nudity. They are often lined with a fabric that prevents them from becoming transparent when wet. Bacteria grow well on wet or damp swimsuits. For this reason people should change rapidly from a wet swimsuit to a dry one. Doctors also say that for this reason sharing unwashed swimsuits is s bad idea. == Lists == === Womens' swimsuits === Image Name Notes One-piece swimsuit One-piece swimsuit is intended to create a more streamlined shape, enabling the water to move over your body with less resistance.
