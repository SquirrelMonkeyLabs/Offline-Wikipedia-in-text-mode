He was a bodyguard in the stable Special K. Abyss appeared only once because TNA pulled all of their wrestlers from ROH. Abyss returned in the summer of 2005. This time, he was a member of Prince Nana's stable, The Embassy. They were fighting with Generation Next. This lasted for the rest of 2005. There were several matches and fights between both teams. The feud ended in a Steel Cage Warfare match at December's Steel Cage Warfare. In the match, Abyss teamed with Alex Shelley, Jimmy Rave and Prince Nana to take on Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, Jack Evans and Matt Sydal. Abyss was eliminated by Jack Evans. Generation Next won the match and the feud. In January 2006, Abyss teamed with Embassy members Jimmy Rave and Alex Shelley to wrestle in the Trios Tournament. They won the tournament. This meant that all three of its winning members had won a chance to wrestle for the World Championship. Abyss left ROH before this happened. ===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003 - 2019)=== Parks was on TNA's first show using the ring name \"Justice\". He took part in a gauntlet match for the new NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He did not win the match. Parks returned to TNA as \"The Monster Abyss\" in June 2003. He started by attacking Jeff Hardy. His feud with Hardy did not last long. Hardy had been suspended before their their first match. Parks was used as a bodyguard to Kid Kash. He was an ally to Kash until October, when Kash yelled at Abyss for losing a match. This caused Abyss to attack Kash. Abyss won a match against Kash, but then lost a First Blood Steel Chair on a Pole match to him. The feud between the two ended soon after the match. In 2004, Abyss had his first major feud with A.J. Styles. On one show, Abyss was forced to team with Styles in a NWA World Tag Team Championship match. Abyss left Styles near the beginning of the match but they still won. Abyss defeated Styles on the next show. On the show after that, he got control of the titles by winning a Four Corners Tables match against Styles. Later, the titles were taken away from Abyss. On the next show, they wrestled in a Falls Count Anywhere match. Neither of them won the match. The next show had Abyss win against Styles in a Ladder match to become the top contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Abyss lost the right to Raven in a match that also involved Styles and Ron Killings. About a month later, Abyss got a new manager, Goldy Locks. She used Abyss to win the contract of her ex-boyfriend Erik Watts. She kept using Abyss to win contracts for her. She also added Alex Shelley to her group to help them win the title. Goldy Locks treated Shelley very good but treated Abyss poorly. Watts returned for revenge. Abyss, Shelley, and Goldy Locks wrestled against Watts, Sonny Siaki and Desire. During the match, Abyss turned on his team. He attacked Goldy Locks and left match and her. Not long after separating from Goldy Locks, Abyss began to feud with Monty Brown and Raven. This led to the first ever Monster's Ball match at TNA's first monthly pay per view, Victory Road. At Victory Road, Brown won the match when he pinned Raven. Abyss and Brown continued to feud in a match at Turning Point. Brown won the match. ==In wrestling== ===As Abyss=== ;Finishing and signature moves *Black Hole Slam (180°, 270°, or a 360° spinning side slam) *Shock Treatment (Backbreaker rack drop) *Superbomb - Independent circuit *Chokeslam *Twisting chinlock sleeper hold *Sidewalk slam *Running corner body splash *Military press dropped into a flapjack *Overhead belly to belly suplex *Spear *Big boot *Running hip attack to the head of an opponent seated against the bottom turnbuckle ;Signature foreign objects *Steel chain *Thumbtacks *Broken glass shards ===As Prince Justice=== *Death Penalty (Chokebomb pin) *Royal Decree (Sidewalk slam) ===Managers=== :*Jeff G.
