 "text": "Allobates niputidea is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives in forests where the trees are not taller than 20 m. This frog is awake during the day. People see the frogs through streams that flow all year. Scientists have seen this frog between 50 and 970 meters above sea level. This frog is not good at living in places that human beings have changed. Scientists have seen the frog in some protected places: Embalse Topocoro private reserve from ISAGEN, Pauxi Pauxi ProAves Reserve and Cabildo Verde Reserve. ==Young== The adult male frog sits on the dead leaves on the ground and calls to the female frogs. The frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole. People see young frogs near pools of water in the forest. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. People change the forests into farms and places to raise animals. People make big farms to grow cacao. Other people also make small farms for cacao, avocadoes, and bananas, but they use traditional forest farming, which does not hurt the forest much because it does not use chemicals to make plants grow or kill pests. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
