 "text": "Miguel Alemán Valdés (29 September 1900 – 14 May 1983) was a Mexican politician who served a full term as the President of Mexico from 1946 to 1952, the first civilian president after a string of revolutionary generals. His administration was characterized by Mexico's rapid industrialization, often called the Mexican Miracle, but also for a high level of personal enrichment for himself and his associates. His presidency was the first of a new generation of Mexican leaders, who had not directly participated in the Mexican Revolution, and many in his cabinet were also young, university- educated civilians, close friends from his days at university. ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Presidents of Mexico Category:People from Veracruz Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:20th-century presidents of Mexico",
