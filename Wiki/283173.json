 "text": "A hearing aid is a small electrical machine which fits in or behind a person's ear. The purpose of a hearing aid is to make sounds louder so the deaf person can hear spoken words and other sounds. The two most common types of modern hearing aids are behind the ear aids and in the ear aids. Before hearing aids were invented, people used \"ear trumpets\" also called ear horns.Comparison of Hearing Aids Over the 20th Century. Ear & Hearing. 21(6):625-639, December 2000.

These can be used by people with mild to severe hearing loss *Behind-The-Ear (BTE) - sit behind the ear and connect to a mould placed in your ear through a tube.
