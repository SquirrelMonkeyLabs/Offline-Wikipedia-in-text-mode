 "text": "Big Brother 1 was the first season of the Canadian reality television game show, Big Brother. It is based on the Dutch language show of the same name. The show is produced by Endemol USA and Insight Productions. Big Brother 1 aired on Slice on February 27, 2013. It lasted for 71 days. The first season ended on May 2, 2013. Over 10,000 people applied to be on the show. Only fourteen HouseGuests were needed. However, because a lot of people tried out for the show, producers allowed fifteen people to enter the house. In January 2013, Arisa Cox was announced to be the host of the show. Jillian McLaughlin was the winner of the first season. Gary Levy was the runner-up in a controversial finale vote of 4-3. Juror Emerald \"Topaz\" Brady voted for McLaughlin by mistake. She begged for producers so she can change her vote, which they did not allowed. == Format == Big Brother 1 was similar to that of the one featured in the US version. A group of people, known as \"HouseGuests\", compete to win the show. They vote each other off to be the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto has the ability to change the nominations. If they choose to do so, the HoH must nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees. The HouseGuest with the most votes is removed from the show. There was a twist for this season. A phone was placed in the house, and the first person to answer would receive a secret task. ==Controversy== During the final vote Topaz Brady voted for Jillian McLaughlin instead of Gary Levy. She said that she mistakenly voted for Jillian. Topaz pleaded with show producers to allow her vote be changed. However, because of the rules she was not allowed to do so. Topaz's vote for Jillian helped her win Big Brother. Gary was runner-up and said that he is happy for Jillian. ==HouseGuests== Name Age* Occupation Residence Alec Beall 27 Social Psychology Student Andrew Monaghan 38 Insurance Sales Trainer Aneal Ramkissoon 21 Student Anuj ‘AJ’ Burman 32 Director of Business Development Danielle Alexander 20 Aspiring Actress Emerald \"Topaz\" Brady 27 Dental Hygienist Emmett Blois 24 Dairy Farmer Gary Levy 21 Fashion Stylist Assistant Jillian MacLaughlin 27 Teacher Kat Yee 27 Bartender Liza Stinton 29 Tanning Salon Owner Peter Brown 26 Web Content Curator Suzette Amaya 36 Radio Show Host/Motivational Speaker Talla Rajaei 26 Independent Living Support Thomas \"Tom\" Plant 25 Firefighter * Age of the HouseGuest at the beginning of the Season ==Voting history== Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Eviction votes received Day 15 Day 22 Day 23 Day 29 Day 36 Day 37 Day 43 Day 50 Day 64 Eviction votes received Head of Household Suzette Jillian Tom Gary Andrew Alec Topaz Andrew Jillian Emmett Jillian Emmett Jillian Gary (none) Nominations (pre-veto) Emmett Tom Aneal Gary Gary Suzette AJ Suzette Liza Tom Liza Suzette AJ Suzette AJ Andrew Gary Topaz Alec Peter Talla Topaz Andrew Peter Andrew Gary Gary Talla Emmett Jillian Veto Winner Tom Gary Tom Suzette Alec Emmett Emmett (none) Andrew Peter Peter Andrew Gary Emmett (none) Nominations (post-veto) Emmett Kat Aneal Danielle AJ Suzette AJ Aneal Liza Tom Liza Suzette AJ Suzette Gary Topaz Alec Topaz Talla Topaz Peter Talla Andrew Talla Gary Talla Jillian Kat Head of Household Nominations void AJ Tom Liza Suzette AJ Gary Head of Household Topaz Head of Household Andrew Head of Household Nominated Winner $100,000 0 Gary Kat Aneal Nominations void Aneal Head of Household Liza AJ Andrew Nominated Evicted (Day 43) Andrew Nominated Emmett $20,000 5 Emmett Nominated Danielle Nominations void Aneal Liza Liza Suzette AJ Gary Alec Head of Household Peter Head of Household Talla Evicted (Day 71) Jillian 2 Talla Kat Aneal Nominations void Aneal Tom Liza Suzette Andrew Gary Alec Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Evicted Jillian 1 Andrew Kat Danielle Nominations void Aneal Tom Head of Household Suzette Nominated Head of Household Alec Topaz Peter Nominated Evicted (Day 64) Jillian 4 Peter Kat Danielle Nominations void Aneal Tom Liza Suzette AJ Gary Topaz Topaz Nominated Evicted (Day 57) Gary 2 Topaz Kat Danielle Nominations void Aneal Tom Liza Suzette Head of Household Nominated Nominated Nominated Evicted (Day 50) Jillian 4 Alec Kat Danielle Nominations void Aneal Tom Liza Head of Household AJ Gary Nominated Evicted (Day 50) Gary 3 AJ Kat Danielle Nominated Tom Liza Nominated Nominated Evicted (Day 36) Gary 7 Suzette Head of Household Aneal Nominated Aneal Tom Nominated Nominated Evicted (Day 36) 6 Liza Emmett Danielle Nominations void AJ Nominated Nominated Evicted (Day 29) 9 Tom Kat Danielle Head of Household Nominated Evicted (Day 29) 8 Aneal Kat Nominated Nominations void Nominated Evicted (Day 22) 11 Danielle Kat Nominated Evicted (Day 15) 8 Kat Nominated Evicted (Day 8) 11 Notes 1 none 2, 3 2, 3 4, 5 4, 5 none 6 none 7 7 8 none none none 9 Evicted Kat to evict Danielle to evict None Aneal to evict Tom 8 of 9 votes to evict Liza 8 of 8 votes to evict Suzette 6 of 7 votes to evict AJ 4 of 6 votes to evict Gary 5 of 5 votes to evict Alec 3 of 4 votes to evict Topaz 3 of 3 votes to evict Peter 2 of 2 votes to evict Andrew 2 of 2 votes to evict Talla to evict Emmett to evict Gary 3 votes to win Evicted Jillian 4 votes to win ===Notes=== * : Suzette answered the Red Phone on Day 1 and Big Brother named her the first Head of Household.
