 "text": "Silly Symphony (also known as Silly Symphonies) was a series of animated short films produced by Walt Disney Productions from 1929 to 1939.Pietro Frassica, Her Maestro's Echo: Pirandello and the Actress who Conquered Broadway in One Evening (Leicester: Troubador Publishing, 2010), p. 90 == Disney studios == After the films changed to sound, Walt Disney began making Mickey Mouse and musical Silly Symphony shorts.Maureen Furniss, Art in Motion: Animation Aesthetics (Sydney: John Libbey, 1998), p. 94 To keep costs down Disney produced his own music. Disney's first music director and composer was Carl Stalling. The Mickey Mouse shorts used pop music while the Silly Symphony cartoons used Classical music.The Cartoon Music Book, eds. Daniel Goldmark; Yuval Taylor (Chicago: A Cappella Books, 2002), p. 24 In 1932 the studio produced its first cartoon in Technicolor, Flowers and Trees.Wheeler Winston Dixon; Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, A Short History of Film (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2008), p. 127 The success of the song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?, from the Silly Symphony short Three Little Pigs (1933), convinced Disney to keep producing original music. It was at this time Disney introduced the characters of Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto and Minnie Mouse. Over its ten year run, Silly Symphonies had won Walt Disney the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film seven times, eventually tied with Bill Hanna and Joe Barbara's Tom and Jerry's record for most awards for a cartoon series in the category. It spawned numerous imitators and competitors (like Warner Bros' Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes).
