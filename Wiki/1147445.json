The alb is usually tied at the waist with a rope belt called a cincture. == Use == The alb is worn under other vestments, like the chasuble or dalmatic. Bishops, priests and deacons wear it during Mass and other religious services. The alb is always white. The alb is made from white fabric, often linen or cotton. == History == The alb began as a long white tunic. In the 6th century, it became a clergy vestment. In the 10th century, people added embroidery to the hem and cuffs. In the 16th century, lace covered much of the alb. In the 20th century, the simple white alb returned after the Second Vatican Council. == Related pages == * Stole * Dalmatic * Chasuble == References == Category:Christian clothing Category:Liturgical clothing",
