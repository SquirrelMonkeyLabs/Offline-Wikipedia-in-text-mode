 "text": "Supramolecular chemistry is area of chemistry that studies the relationship and linking molecules into bigger systems. It focuses on the chemical systems made up of a discrete number of assembled molecular subunits or components.Supramolecular Chemistry, J.-M. Lehn, Wiley-VCH (1995) The study of non-covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes from cell structure to vision that rely on these forces for structure and function. Biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research. ==Related pages== *Organic chemistry *Nanotechnology ==References== ==Other websites== *2D and 3D Models of Dodecahedrane and Cuneane Assemlies * Supramolecular Chemistry - Thematic Series in the Open Access Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry Category:Branches of chemistry",
