 "text": "The Anglican Adam Preaching Society is an interdenominational evangelical Christian movement based in Nigeria, which was founded by an evangelist of the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, the late Cornelius Adam Igbudu who hailed from Araya in Isokoland. According to the A.A.P.S. official website, the evangelical group \"is an interdenominational preaching society under the umbrella of the Anglican Communion. It stands for professional soul winning and being run by self-sacrifice and freewill donations\". It was considered as being \"famous for the spread of the gospel of Christ across Nigeria\". Professor Peter Palmer Ekeh, Founder of Urhobo Historical Society, later wrote in his book: History of the Urhobo People of Niger Delta, that \"The evangelical movement of Adam's Anglican Preaching Society (A.A.P.S.), which he [Igbudu] founded, bestrode the Anglican Communion in the Former Bendel State. It created waves of mass conversions\". ==History== History has it that Cornelius Adam Igbudu was born in 1914 in a local village of Araya to Isoko pagan parents who were idol worshippers, and before he became a Christian in 1927, he was part of a traditional dance group in Uzere in Isokoland. Shortly after Igbudu left the dance group, in 1938 he formed the \"Ole-Orufuo\", a prayer group which later developed into an evangelical group. After the movement locally became known as the \"Ukoko Adamu\" (meaning, \"Adam's Preaching Society\") in 1946, in the ensuing years there was a need to absorb it into the Nigerian Anglican Church and the word \"Anglican\" was formally added to the name of the group. ==Evangelistic impact== The evangelistic group of A.A.P.S. in the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, over the years has greatly helped spread the gospel across Nigeria and, through Igbudu's evangelism, has also \"won thousands to Christ\". The Anglican Adam Preaching Society (A.A.P.S) has not ended along with Cornelius Adam Igbudu in 1981. In fact, it has expanded over the years and, according to Professor Sam U. Erivwo, through this movement the Urhobo, the Isoko and the Itsekiri witnessed (and are still witnessing) unusual revival. With the coming of Christianity into Nigeria, the evangelical group of A.A.P.S., through Igbudu's evangelism, changed the face of Christianity in Africa and made it real to many Africans, notably the Isoko people and the Urhobo people in the present-day Delta State of Nigeria. As a result, the evangelistic activities of the evangelical group seem to have led to a change of practice, as many Urhobo people as well as Isoko people have now become Christians and have nothing to do with idol worship. It earned its founder a praise of being one of \"Isoko's greatest evangelists\". ==Musical impact== The musical impact of the A.A.P.S. evangelical movement continues to be seen today as having improved both Isoko and Urhobo gospel music with the release of local African music by Igbudu himself, \"a man whose Isoko self- composed songs inspired many\". At that time when the style of worship and the mode of music in the mission churches were done in a western way, which made many Africans not to be catching in on it, Cornelius Adam Igbudu came into the scene and caused a change of practice by bringing local Isoko music into the mission churches. It earned Igbudu a praise from E. Onosemuode, who called him \"a great musical reformer among Isoko and Urhobo Christians\". Other writers in 2022 also mentioned Igbudu's name among those \"who could be regarded as pioneers\" of local African music. However, some important people of Isoko and Urhobo origins, who seemed \"to have followed after the steps of the pioneers\", later included Evi Edna Ogholi and Kefee Obareki Don Momoh. In 2005, the A.A.P.S. evangelical movement's continued musical influence in the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, was clearly shown in the singing of \"entertainment songs by the Anglican Adam Preaching Society (AAPS) band\" during a church service held in remembrance of Bishop Agori Iwe who died on July 9, 1979. ==Socio-economic impact== From the days of Cornelius Adam Igbudu until now, the evangelical group of A.A.P.S. is also noted for its genuine concern about providing social services, especially for its members. In October 2012, the A.A.P.S. assisted flood victims in Delta State with relief materials. ==Religious disputes== Igbudu, the founder of the A.A.P.S. evangelical movement, was said to have had a disagreement with a prominent Nigerian Isoko cleric, Archbishop Christian Aggrey Apena, whom he accused of \"disturbing his ministry\" in the Nigerian Anglican Church. In the early 1970s, the Anglican Adam Preaching Society (A.A.P.S.) and the Scripture Union (S.U.) were accused of what Archbishop Christian Aggrey Apena considered as \"religiously rebellious\", by the Anglican clergy who felt that some members of both \"evangelistic wings of the Church\" were not only introducing strange doctrines to the Church but also challenging the constituted authorities of the Church. As a result, it made some A.A.P.S. members to be kicked out of the Church. ==Leadership== Since the death of its founder on 12 March 1981, the evangelical group of A.A.P.S. has continued to operate under a lot of elected National Executives. As of 2022, the leaders of the A.A.P.S. movement included Evang. F. K. A. Usenu (JP) - National President, Evang. Sir. J. I. Afimoni (JP) - Vice National President, Evang. P. E. Ejovi - National Secretary, and Evang. Emma Ofano (JP) - Music Director. ==References== ==Other websites== * Missionary website Category:Christian organizations Category:Organizations based in Nigeria",
