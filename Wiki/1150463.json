 "text": "Starro is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky, first appearing in The Brave and the Bold #28 (1960). == Fictional character biography == He is depicted as an alien super-villain who intends to take over the universe. As one of the Star Conquerors, its physical appearance is that of a gigantic starfish, containing millions of similar drones that latch onto a host and control its mind. This ability to dominate an entire populace with ease makes him an incredibly dangerous threat, and one of the earliest and greatest enemies of the Justice League. == Powers and abilities == An asexual creature, Starro's spores are capable of generating clones that act in accordance with the original's will. The clones are parasites by nature and can attach themselves to a humanoid's face, and subsequently take control of the host's central nervous system, thereby controlling the host. == In other media == Starro is the first villain to face the original Justice League of America. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has appeared in both comic books and other DC Comicsâ€“related products, such as animated television series, video games, and the DC Extended Universe movie The Suicide Squad (2021).
