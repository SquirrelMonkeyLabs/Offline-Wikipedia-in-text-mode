 "text": "Mount Gongga is a mountain in the Daxue Shan range, in Sichuan China. It is also known as Gongga Shan and Minya Konka. The name Minya Konka means \"White Ice Mountain of Minyang\". It is the 41st highest mountain in the world. The first people to reach the top were Richard Burdsall and Terris Moore, in 1932. It was not climbed again until 1957. Mount Gongga is thought of as one of the hardest and most dangerous mountains to climb. There have been many deaths on the mountain. These include a group of eight Japanese climbers in 1981. Until 1999, more people had died on the mountain than had made it to the top. == References == Category:Mountains of China Category:Sichuan",
