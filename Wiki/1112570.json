 "text": "East Pakenham is a railway station on the Pakenham line in Melbourne, Australia. It opened in 2024 when the nearby Pakenham station was rebuilt to remove three level crossings. The station has four tracks so that V-line inter-city trains can bypass suburban trains which end their journey at East Pakenham. By 2025, trains from East Pakenham will travel through the Metro Tunnel and connect to the Sunbury line.https://bigbuild.vic.gov.au/projects/metro-tunnel ==References ==",
