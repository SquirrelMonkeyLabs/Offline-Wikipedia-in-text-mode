He is third in line to succeed his grandfather King Harald V, after his father and elder sister, Princess Ingrid Alexandra. ==Birth and education== Prince Sverre Magnus was born on 3 December 2005 at The National Hospital the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo, where his sister Princess Ingrid Alexandra had been born a year earlier. == Constitutional status == The Constitution of Norway was changed in 1990 to introduce full primogeniture, ensuring that the crown would pass to the eldest child regardless of sex but keeping the Crown Prince ahead of his elder sister, Princess Märtha Louise. This change applied for the first time to the children of the Crown Prince, meaning that Sverre Magnus would not rank above his elder sister, as would have happened under the older constitutional rules. Sverre Magnus is third in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne following his sister. He is a member of the Royal Family but not of the Royal House, which includes only his grandparents, parents, and sister. ==Titles, styles, honors and arms== ===Titles and styles=== *3 December 2005 – present: His Highness Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway ===Honors === * : Recipient of King Harald V's Jubilee Medal 1991-2016 (17 January 2016) * Norway: Grand Cross of the Royal Order of St Olav (3 December 2023) ===Arms=== ==Title and style== Prince Sverre Magnus is styled as His Highness Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway, as opposed to his sister, who is styled as Her Royal Highness. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Biography on the official website of the Royal House of Norway * Video by NRK from the baptism of Prince Sverre Magnus Category:Norwegian princes Category:House of Glücksburg (Norway) Category:2005 births Category:Living people",
