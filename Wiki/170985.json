 "text": "The Invasion of Grenada, codenamed Operation Urgent Fury, was an invasion of the nation of Grenada ordered by President Ronald Reagan. Grenada is an island in the Caribbean Sea, 100 miles north of Venezuela, and over 1,500 miles south east of the United States. It was invaded by the combined force of troops from the United States (nearly 10,000 troops), Jamaica and members of the Regional Security System (RSS) (approximately 300 troops). Grenada had gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The communist New JEWEL Movement seized power in a nearly bloodless coup in 1979 under Maurice Bishop suspending the constitution and detaining several political prisoners. The Reagan administration mounted a US military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. President Reagan stated that he felt compelled to act due to \"concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island\" Category:1983 in the United States Category:History of Grenada Category:1980s conflicts",
