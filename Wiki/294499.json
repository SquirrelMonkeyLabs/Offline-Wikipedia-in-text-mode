The development of P. robustus, namely in cranial features, seemed to be aimed in the direction of a \"heavy-chewing complex\". Because of the definitive traits that are associated with this robust line of australopithecine, anthropologist Robert Broom erected the genus Paranthropus and placed this species into it.
