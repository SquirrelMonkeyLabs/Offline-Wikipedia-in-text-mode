 "text": "Juan Francisco Velasco Alvarado (16 June 1910 – 24 December 1977) also known by his initials JVA or JFA, was a Peruvian soldier and politician who served as the 50th President of Peru and the 1st President of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru from 1968 until his resignation in 1975. He came after a successful coup d'état against his predecessor, Fernando Belaúnde Terry. Under his presidency, nationalism, as well as left-leaning policies that addressed Indigenous Peruvians, such as nationalization or agrarian reform were adopted. These policies were reversed after another coup d'état in 1975 led by his Prime Minister, Francisco Morales-Bermúdez. Alvarado kept a low profile until he died in Lima on 24 December 1977, at the age of 67. Category:1910 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Presidents of Peru",
