 "text": "The Trinidad leaf frog or Trinidad leaf-nesting frog (Phyllomedusa trinitatis) is a frog that lives in Trinidad and in mountains in Venezuela near the ocean. Scientists have seen it up in the mountains, between 280 and 1000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees and moves around at night. It lives in forests both low to the sea level and high up in mountains. People have seen it in ditches and in other places that human beings have changed. People call this a \"bush-dwelling frog\" because people see it in bushes, but the frogs are only in these low plants when it is time to lay eggs. The rest of the year, they are high in the trees where the branches meet like a roof, where people do not see it. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Frogs of South America",
