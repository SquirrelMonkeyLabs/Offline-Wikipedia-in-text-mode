 "text": "A linstock (or lintstock) is a rod or stick that supports a slow match, which was used to light cannons in the early days of artillery. The linstock allowed the gunner to stand farther from the cannon as it was dangerous applying the lighted match to the touch hole at the breech of the gun: not only could the charge flash back, but the recoil of the cannon might send the carriage toward the gunner. Linstocks also had a sharp point to drive into the ground when not in use or to use as a weapon to protect the cannon. ==References== Category:Artillery",
