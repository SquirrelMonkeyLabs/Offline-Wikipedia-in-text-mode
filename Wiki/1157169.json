 "text": "The Seuna–Hoysala War was a prolonged conflict between the Seuna Yadava Kingdom and the Hoysala Kingdom in southern India, lasting for 124 years from the late 12th century to the early 14th century. The war began during the reign of Bhillama V of the Seuna Yadavas and Veera Ballala II of the Hoysalas, as both kingdoms sought to expand their territories and assert dominance over the Deccan region. The conflict saw numerous battles and shifting alliances as the two kingdoms vied for control over key areas, including the rich lands of present-day Karnataka and Maharashtra. The Delhi Sultanate played a decisive role in influencing the course of the war. In 1296, the Sultanate supported the Hoysalas, bolstering their position against the Seunas. However, by 1311, the Sultanate switched its allegiance to the Seuna Yadavas, reflecting the political complexities of the era. The prolonged struggle weakened both kingdoms, eventually paving the way for their subjugation by the Delhi Sultanate. This war marked a significant chapter in the history of South India, highlighting the intense rivalries and external pressures faced by regional powers during the medieval period. ==Seuna–Hoysala Struggle== ===Seuna–Hoysala War of 1187=== After Bhillama’s northern raids, the Hoysala ruler Ballala attacked Chalukya king Someshvara IV, forcing him to flee to Banavasi. Bhillama then defeated Ballala, captured Kalyani around 1187 CE, and established Devagiri as the Yadava capital. Ballala later regrouped and, by 1189, captured Banavasi and Nolambavadi. Bhillama’s large army faced Ballala at Soratur but was decisively defeated. Ballala killed the Yadava general Jaitrapala and seized key forts, pushing the Yadavas north of the Malaprabha and Krishna rivers, which marked the Hoysala-Yadava border for 20 years. ===Seuna–Hoysala War of 1194=== After the Battle of Soratur, Bhillama failed to capture the fort of Lokkigundi, but Jaitugi likely took control of it soon after. In response, Ballala launched an expedition and recaptured the fort in 1194 CE by defeating Jaitugi, as confirmed by inscriptions from Koligunda in 1198 CE. Despite his victory, Ballala remained cautious of Jaitugi’s threat, frequently camping at Lokkigundi and nearby areas. He was at Lokkigundi in 1199 CE, Huligere (modern Lakshmesvar) in 1200 CE, and again at Lakkundi in 1205 CE. Jaitugi did not attempt another invasion after his defeat. Instead, his son, Simhana II, later sought to expand his control over the region, including areas to the south. Ballala’s defensive actions helped secure his northern territories, but the threat from Simhana II would emerge later. === Seuna–Hoysala War of 1202 === Simhana's grandfather, Bhillama V, had been badly defeated by the Hoysala king Ballala II at Soratur. To take revenge, the Yadavas decided to invade Hoysala-controlled lands. Simhana's inscriptions, found in the region south of the Malaprabha River, date back to 1202, showing that the Yadavas had already started expanding into this area by then. By 1206, they had taken over parts of what is now the Bijapur district and placed it under their general, Keshavadeva. By 1212, the Yadavas had extended their control to areas that are now Anantapur, Bellary, Chitradurga, and Shimoga districts. By 1213, they had taken over most of the present-day Dharwad district, as shown by an inscription in Gadag. Other inscriptions at Gadag, Paithan, and Tiluvalli mention that Simhana defeated Ballala. The Rattas of Saundatti, who were earlier loyal to the Hoysalas, switched sides and supported Simhana. They helped him expand Yadava power further south. Before 1215, the Yadavas captured Banavasi, and Simhana appointed his trusted official, Mayideva, as governor. In 1222, Mayideva was replaced by another officer, Vanka Ravata, from Karad. By 1220, Simhana had completed his conquest of the land north of the Tungabhadra River. The Hoysalas, who were occupied with fighting the Pandyas in the south, could not stop Simhana's advances. In 1226 and 1231 two more Battles took place between Hoysalas and Seunas in which latter defeated the former. === Seuna–Hoysala War of 1250=== The southern region faced instability as Hoysala ruler Somesvara struggled to manage his affairs in Tamil Nadu while attempting to reclaim northern territories taken by the Seuna king. A 1257 A.D. inscription reveals that Somesvara had begun these efforts either upon becoming king or during his father’s reign. His titles, such as Säuparaya-diakpatta and Säuvaraya-dazon-dalana, highlight repeated battles against the Seuna king, Kannara/Krishna. However, these conflicts were largely unsuccessful, as an inscription by Kannara describes his minister as a rival to Somesvara, reflecting the Hoysala king's inability to regain lost lands. Somesvara not only failed to recover his northern territories but also could not stop the Seunas from advancing further. Seuna king Singhana's influence extended into Hoysala regions, including Shimoga and Chitradurga districts, indicating the Hoysalas’ weakening control. Somesvara’s focus on Chola affairs in the south further undermined his ability to counter the Seunas in the north, allowing them to expand their power steadily. === Seuna—Hoysala War of 1260=== By the 1260s, the southern Hoysala kingdom was split into two parts. The northern part was ruled by Narasimha III. Around 1266, Mahadeva, a king from another kingdom, attacked Narasimha's territory. Some inscriptions in the Hoysala area, like those in Chitradurga district, show that the Yadavas had some influence there. However, Mahadeva's invasion failed, and he had to retreat. Two Hoysala records say that Mahadeva underestimated Narasimha's strength. He entered the battlefield proudly on an elephant but was defeated and had to escape on a horse at night. His general Balugideva Saluva was killed in this conflict. ===Seuna–Hoysala War (1275–1311)=== During the rule of Mahadeva, the Yadavas were defeated by the Hoysalas, prompting his nephew Ramachandra to plan a powerful military campaign for revenge. After 2–3 years of preparation, Ramachandra sent an army led by commanders like Saluva Tikkama, Joyideva, Harapala, and others. In 1275, Tikkama invaded Hoysala territory and camped at Belavadi near the Hoysala capital, Dvarasamudra. He defeated a Hoysala force sent by King Narasimha III in early 1276. Meanwhile, another Yadava army led by Kannaradeva attacked Doravadi, winning the battle but losing Minister Vanadevarasa to the Hoysala chief Singeya Nayaka. Tikkama then besieged the Hoysala capital, where fierce battles resulted in the deaths of several Hoysala generals. However, on 25 April 1276, Ankeya Nayaka, the son of the Hoysala commander-in-chief, launched a decisive counterattack, forcing Tikkama to retreat to Dhummi. Despite initial victories, the Yadavas could not capture the Hoysala capital. However Seuna Records states that Tikkama was able to capture the Hoysala captial forcing them to pay tribute. In 1296 When the Muslim Sultanate of Delhi under Alauddin Khalji and Nusrat Khan attacked Devagiri, Hoysalas supported them against Seunas and succeed inflicting a crushing defeat on them. As soon as Khalji returned the conflicts were renowned between the two. In 1311 Malik Kafur invaded the Hoysala captial and this time Ramachandra showed his full support to Malik Kafur collectively defeating Hoysalas. ==List of Conflicts== Conflict Seunas Hoysalas Result Battle of Kalyani (1187) Bhillama Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Basavakalyana (1189) Bhillama Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Banavasi (1189) Bhillama Vera Balla Hoysala victory Capture of Nolambavadi (1189) Bhillama Vera Balla Hoysala victory Battle of Soratur (1190) Bhillama Jaitrasimha Vera Balla Hoysala victory Capture of Lokkigundi Jaitugi Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Lokkigundi (1194) Jaitugi Vera Balla Hoysala victory Capture of Bijapur district (1206) Simhana II Kholesvara Vera balla Seuna victory Capture of Anantapur (1212) Simhana II Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Ballari (1212) Simhana II Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Chitradurga (1212) Simhana II Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Shimoga (1212) Simhana II Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Dharwad (1213) Simhana II Vera Balla Seuna victory Capture of Banavasi (1215) Simhana II Vera Balla Seuna victory Battle of Belagutti (1217) Simhana II Vera Balla Seuna victory Battle of Neralige (1224) Harihara Narsimha Seuna victory Capture of Shimoga (1250) Krishna Someshwara Seuna victory Capture of Chitradurga (1250) Krishna Someshwara Seuna victory Mahadeva Invasion of Hoysala (1266) Mahadeva Narsimha III Hoysala victory Battle of Belavadi (1275) Tikkama Saluva Anka Maideva Seuna victory Battle of Doravadi (1276) Kanndadeva Vanadevarasa Singeya Nayaka Seuna victory Skirmish at Dvarasamudra Tikkama Saluva Nanjeya Gullaya Seuna victory Siege of Dvarasamudra (1276) Tikkama Saluva Narshima III Ankeya Nayaka Indecesive Khalji Raid of Devagiri (1296) Ramchandra Shakradeva Allaudin Khalji Nusrat Khan Narshima III Delhi–Hoysala victory Battle of Nulgeri (1302) Yebaranayaka Kétanayaka Indecisive Battle of Holalakere (1303) Kapildeva Someya Seuna victory Siege of Dvarasamudra (1311) Malik Kafur Ramachandra Balla III Delhi–Seuna victory == References == Category:India",
