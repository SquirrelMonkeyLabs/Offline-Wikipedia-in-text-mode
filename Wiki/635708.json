 "text": "Gözleme is a traditional Turkish pastry. It is made of thin layers of dough that are filled with toppings and cooked. The dough is usually made with flour, salt and water. The name comes from the Turkish word közleme, meaning \"to grill or cook on embers\". There are many toppings used in gözleme in different places around the world. Some popular ones are meat, vegetables, mushrooms, potatoes, cheese, herbs, and spices. Gözleme started out as a breakfast food and snack. In the late 20th century it became a fast-food in Turkey, with lots more styles and ingredients available. It is found in restaurants, cafés, and food carts. == Images == File:Mantar Gozleme.jpg|Traditional tableside preparation of gözleme in a restaurant near Antalya.
