 "text": "Lapham's warty frog (Callulina laphami) is a species of frog found in Tanzania, specifically in the North Park mountains. It has been observed at elevations between 1,730 and 2,000 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== The adult male Lapham's warty frog measures approximately 22.8â€“29.0 mm in snout- vent length, while the adult female is slightly larger, ranging from 33.5 to 45.4 mm. This species is distinctive within the Callulina genus due to its less-visible tympanum (eardrum) and shorter toes. The skin on its back is dark brown, while its sides are light brown, and the belly is light-colored. A bright red line often runs between its eyes, although in some individuals, this line is green. During the day, this frog sits under logs or rocks near streams. At night, it sits on medium-sized woody plants or tree branches. ==Reproduction== The frog lays eggs during the dry season. The mother frog sits on the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They are never tadpoles. The frogs become adults in about eight months. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where the frogs live. Humans cut trees down to get wood to build with, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to build towns and cities. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for Lewis H. Lapham, who helped protect the animals and plants of Tanzania. ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
