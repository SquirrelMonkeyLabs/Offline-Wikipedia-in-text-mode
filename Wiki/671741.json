He worked in a computer-related position at the United States Department of State in the mid-1960s. He was known for his works The CIA: A Forgotten History (1986), Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower (2000) and Killing Hope (2003). In early 2006, Blum briefly became the subject of widespread media attention when Osama bin Laden issued a public statement in which he quoted Blum and recommended that all Americans read Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower. Blum was born in Brooklyn, New York. He died on December 9, 2018 in Arlington, Virginia from kidney failure at the age of 85.William Blum, U.S. Policy Critic Cited by bin Laden, Dies at 85 ==References== ==Other websites== *William Blum * *American Exceptionalism: The Naked Truth by William Blum at CovertAction Magazine Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American journalists Category:American political activists Category:American political writers Category:American historians Category:Writers from Brooklyn Category:Writers from Washington, D.C.",
