The widow had to be receiving Child Benefit for a child who was either hers or her late husband's. * Bereavement benefit or Bereavement Support Payment started in 2017. It replaced Bereavement Payment and Bereavement Allowance. It is paid to a husband/wife or civil partner of a person who has died in the previous 21 months. In August 2018 the Supreme Court decided that it was against human rights law to deny these payments to unmarried parents. In 2023 unmarried people can claim. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom",
