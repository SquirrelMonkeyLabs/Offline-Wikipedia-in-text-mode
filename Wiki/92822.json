 "text": "Publius Ovidius Naso. better known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was an Ancient Roman poet. He was born on March 20, 43 BC in Sulmona, then called Sulmo. People today do not know when he died. It was probably either 17 AD or 18 AD.Hieronimus notes for the year 18 AD: Ovidius poeta in exilio diem obiit et iuxta oppidum Tomos sepelitur (Ovid the poet died in exile and is buried next to the (fortification/castle) Tomis). Some editions of his work also have 16 or 17 noted instead of 18. He died in Tomis, which is modern-day Constanţa in Romania. With Virgil and Horace he is considered among the three great poets of Latin literature. Ovid usually wrote in verses. Ovid was the most widely read classical author in medieval times and the Renaissance. == Works == === Works by Ovid (with approximate dates of publication) === * Amores (\"The Loves\"), five books, published 10 BC and revised into three books ca. 1 AD. * Metamorphoses, (\"Transformations\"), 15 books.
