In 1940 there were 100,000 Americans with Luxembourgish ancestry.\"De L'état à la nation 1839–1989\" Imprimeries St. Paul. p. 145. The first families from Luxembourg went to the United States around 1842. They left because of the overpopulation and economic change in Luxembourg. Most Luxembourgish Americans live in the Midwest. This was where most of them settled in the nineteenth century. In 2000, the states with the largest Luxembourgish American populations were Illinois (6,963), Wisconsin (6,580), Minnesota (5,867), Iowa (5,624), and California (2,824). == References == Category:Luxembourgian people Category:Ethnic groups in the United States",
