 "text": "The Tigray War was a major war in the Horn of Africa, waged by Ethiopia and Eritrea against the Tigray Region and various separatist groups from 2020 to 2022. The war became infamous for the war crimes committed by both sides and the spillover into neighboring countries. It ended with the surrender of the Tigray Region and the reintegration of the region into Ethiopia. Militias, most notably Fano, from the Amhara Region played a decisive role in the Ethiopian victory. The Western Zone was occupied by Fano during the Tigray War and so has since become a war zone during the 2023 Amhara War. == Related pages== *List of ongoing armed conflicts ==References== Category:November 2020 events Category:December 2020 events Category:2020 in Africa Category:21st century in Ethiopia Category:Conflicts in 2020",
