 "text": "Hyloxalus chlorocraspedus is a frog. It lives in Brazil and Peru. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog on ground in forests that had never been cut down. Mostly, they found it in open places where a tree had fallen down, making room in the leaves for sunlight to come through to the ground. ==Reproduction== Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on the ground, but they have not seen female Hyloxalus chlorocraspedus do this. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to water, for example water in the trunk of a dead tree. Scientists saw a male frog with tadpoles on his back. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is dying out. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
