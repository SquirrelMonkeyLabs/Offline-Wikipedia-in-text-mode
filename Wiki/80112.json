 "text": "Waluigi is a character in Nintendo's series of Mario video games. He is the villainous version of Luigi in the same way that Wario is the evil version of Mario. Waluigi is a very tall and skinny man who wears purple and black. ==Characteristics== Waluigi is very tall and thin. He wears black overalls with a purple shirt, and has brown, pointed shoes. He has an upside-down L (Î“) on his hat, gloves and moustache that looks like a Greek letter Gamma. He was made as a partner for Wario by the company Camelot in Mario Tennis and other Mario spinoff games and has no real story behind him. He is in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as an Assist Trophy. Waluigi is known to be smarter than Wario but acts sillier. ==Notable appearances== ==Reception== Waluigi was ranked in the tenth slot on GameDaily's top 10 Nintendo characters that deserve their own games. They also listed him as one of the top 25 videogame anti-heroes, saying that it was too bad that he has never had the spotlight. However, he also ranked number one on the Top 10 Worst Mario Characters list from Game Daily, which said, \"for every likable character there's one that continues to annoy us even years after we're done with the game they came from\". Waluigi has been criticised by others as well. Cracked.com said that he was a lazy excuse to add a new villain to the spin-off games and even called him an \"abomination\". ==References== ==Other websites== *Waluigi on Giant Bomb Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2000 Category:Mario series characters Category:Video game memes",
