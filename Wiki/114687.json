It has white rice noodles in beef broth with thin cuts of beef, vegetable, and spice such as chili or chili sauce. Sometimes, tendon, tripe, meatballs, chicken leg, chicken breast, or other organs (heart, liver, etc.) are also available. Pho that is cooked with chicken instead of beef is called phở gà. Pho is a very popular food in Vietnam. It was brought to many other countries when Vietnamese immigrants and refugees moved to those places. == Making pho == === Noodles === A special kind of noodle called bánh phở that is made from rice is used to make pho.
