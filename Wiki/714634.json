 "text": "The Piankeshaw, Piankashaw or Pianguichia Indigenous Peoples are Native Americans and members of the Miami Indians. They lived away from the rest of the Miami nation, therefore they were known as Peeyankihšiaki (\"splitting off\" from the others, Sing.: Peeyankihšia - \"Piankeshaw Person\"). They live in an area that now includes western Indiana and Ohio. They are closely allied with the Wea Indians. Piankeshaw villages have been found along the White River in central Indiana, and along the Vermilion River in Illinois, near Ouiatenon.Dorothy Libby, Summary of Piankashaw Locations (1708- ca. 1763) pp. 58 - 62 The Piankashaw were living along the Vermilion river in 1743.Anthropological report on the Piankashaw ==References== ==Other websites== *Ohio History Central - Piankashaw Indians *1818 Treaty Category:Native Americans",
