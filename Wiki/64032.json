 "text": "Amanda Laura Bynes (born April 3, 1986) is an American actress, former program host on Nickelodeon and fashion designer. After appearing in several successful television series on Nickelodeon in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including her own series, The Amanda Show, Bynes had migrated into a movie career and starred in several movies aimed at teenage audiences. These included Big Fat Liar, She's the Man, Hairspray, and Easy A. She and Drake Bell are the only cast members to have appeared in every episode of The Amanda Show. Bynes has been described by The Boston Globe as having an \"everygirl\" appeal, embodying \"both everything her teen fans dream of being and everything they know they really are, and they love her for it.\" In 2006, she was named one of Teen People's \"25 Hottest Stars Under 25\". She was listed on the 2007 Forbes list as the fifth among the highest paid celebrities under 21, her earning $2.5 million. ==Career== On June 19, 2010, Bynes said on her Twitter that she is retiring from acting saying she does not like it as much as she used to. A month later, Bynes changed her mind and returned to acting. Again in 2012 she said that she is retiring from acting. ==Personal life== In April 2012 Bynes was arrested for side-swiping a police car. In June 2012 she was charged with driving under alcohol or drugs when she was arrested in April. In May 2013 Bynes was arrested at her house in Manhattan for having marijuana. In July she was arrested after she set fire to a stranger's driveway. The police decided that she should be kept for psychiatric evaluation for her own safety. Since September 2013 Bynes has been in The Canyon rehab in Malibu for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder treatment. On March 20, 2023 Bynes was found roaming the streets of Downtown Los Angeles unclothed. Bynes waved down a car and told them she was \"coming down from a psychotic episode\". After calling 911 herself, Bynes was taken to a nearby police station and after an evaluation by mental health officials, she was placed under a psychiatric hold. This comes merely days away from her one-year anniversary of being released from her conservatorship held by her parents Rick and Lynn Bynes. ==Filmography== ===Film=== Year Title Role Notes 2002 Big Fat Liar Kaylee 2003 Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure Nellie (voice) 2003 What a Girl Wants Daphne Reynolds 2005 Robots: The Movie Piper Spears Lopez Pinwheeler (voice) 2005 Love Wrecked Jenny Taylor 2006 She's the Man Viola Hastings 2007 Hairspray Penny Pingleton 2007 Sydney White Sydney White 2010 Easy A Marianne Bryant ===Television=== Year Title Role Notes 1996–2000 All That Various roles Lead role (seasons 3–6) 1997–1999 Figure It Out Panelist Seasons 1–4 1998 Blue's Clues Herself Episode: \"Blue's Birthday\" 1999 Arli$$ Crystal Dupree Episode: \"Our Past, Our Present, Our Future\" 1999–2002 The Amanda Show Host / Various roles Lead role 2000 Crashbox Pink Robot Episode: \"Amanda Bynes\" 2000 Double Dare 2000 Herself 2 episodes; contestant 2001 The Drew Carey Show Sketch player Episode: \"Drew Carey's Back-to-School Rock 'n' Roll Comedy Hour\" 2001 The Nightmare Room Danielle Warner Episode: \"Don't Forget Me\" 2001–2002 Rugrats Taffy (voice) Recurring role (season 9) 2002–2006 What I Like About You Holly Tyler Lead role 2008 Family Guy Anna (voice) Episode: \"Long John Peter\" 2008 Living Proof Jamie Television film ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Ventura County, California Category:American child actors Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American voice actors Category:People from Thousand Oaks, California Category:People with bipolar disorder Category:People with schizophrenia",
