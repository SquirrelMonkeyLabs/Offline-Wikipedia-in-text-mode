 "text": "Ali Sher Anchan or Ali Senge Anchan (Balti: ཨ་ལི་སེང་གེ་དབན་ཆེན།; 1580–1625), was a famous Balti Tibetan king. He belonged to the Maqpon dynasty and became the 15th King of the Makpon Kingdom. His rule saw the unification of Baltistan, expanding its borders to Ladakh and western Tibet in the east, and Ghizar and Chitral in the west. Ali Senge Anchan was a strong and successful leader, considered the greatest King of Greater Baltistan. He conquered Ladakh, Chitral, and Western Tibet. Ali Senge Anchan maintained friendly relations with the Mughal court. His reign brought prosperity to Balti art, sports, and architecture. Other names for Ali Sengge Anchan are Ali Rai, Raja Sher Ali Mir, Mir Ali, Sher Ali, and Ali Zad. He introduced Polo in Gilgit, Chitral, and Ladakh and even sent musicians to learn music in the Mughal court. Ali Senge Anchan built the Skardu fort also known as Kharpocho Khar in Skardu, then the capital of the Makpon Kingdom. == Early life and Military Achievements == Following are Ali Senge Anchans's political and Military achievements and his conquests. === Makpon-Mughal relations === Ali Senge Anchan had connections with the Mughal court. Anchan lost his royal father when he was a child. His uncle the King of Shigar took him and his mother to Shigar, possibly with the plan to harm him and take over the Skardu Kingdom. At 18, Anchan fled to Delhi with twelve loyal followers. In Delhi, Emperor Akbar noticed him for his strength, and he was given command of a Mughal army to reclaim his kingdom. He married a Mughal princess named Gul Khatoon. In 1586 A.D., when Akbar conquered Kashmir, Anchan was with him. === Conquest of Ladakh === According to the tale, Ladakh's kingdom once stretched to Sermik in the west. During the 15th Makpon King Ghazi Mir's rule, Ladakhis were forced out of the Kharmang valley and the entire Purik district. Ali Senge Anchan occupied Kharbu fort and appointed a governor for the border area. Later, Ladakh's Raja, Jamyang Namgyal, attacked Purik. Anchan, along with other leaders, left through Marol, bypassed Leh, and conquered Ladakh around 1594 A.D. The Ladakh Raja, in the end, became a prisoner. To make peace, Ladakh ceded Ganokh and Gagra Nullah villages to Skardu and paid tribute to the Makpon Kings. This tribute was paid through the Monastery of Lama Yuru. Jamyang Namgyal's daughter was also married to Ali Senge Anchan. === Conquest of Dardistan and Chitral === While dealing with attacks on villages in Roundu Baltistan, Dras, Gultari, and Shingo Shigar, Anchan marched on Gilgit. He conquered Astore, Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Chilas, Chitral, and Kafiristan. To celebrate his victory, he planted a Chinar Tree near Bronshel village in Chitral. Balti folk songs praise Anchan's remarkable conquest, defining the Maqpon Empire's boundaries from Leh's Purang to Brushal's Chinar Tree: > ‘Leh Purang na Brushal Shingel’. Anchan is credited with starting Polo at Shundur Polo Ground, Which is the Highest Polo ground in the world. === Conquest of Kargil === Ali Sher Khan Anchan conquered many principalities in Kargil and introduced Balti culture and music to the region. Many Baltis and Purgis settled in Ladakh and Kargil during Anchan's reign. == References == Category:1590 births Category:1625 deaths Category:Pakistani monarchs Category:People from Gilgit-Baltistan Category:History of Pakistan Category:Medieval history of Pakistan Category:History of Chitral Category:Princely rulers of Pakistan",
