 "text": "The New York Times Best Seller list is a list of best-selling books in the United States that has been published weekly on Sundays by the New York Times, a New York City based newspaper since 9 April 1942. It is also released a stand-alone publication, meaning it is sometimes published separately outside of the newspaper, and can also be found online. The list is usually split into fiction and non-fiction sections; each contain ten to twenty titles. It has been accused of being easily manipulated, so it may not actually list the best sellers.
