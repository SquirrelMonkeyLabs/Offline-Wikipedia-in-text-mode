Moroder is often credited with pioneering synth/disco and electronic dance music. ==Career== When in Munich in the 1970s, he started his own record label called Oasis Records. It several years later became a subdivision of Casablanca Records. He worked with Donna Summer during the era of disco (including \"Love to Love You Baby\" and \"I Feel Love\") and is the founder of the former Musicland Studios in Munich. This is a recording studio used by many artists including Electric Light Orchestra, Led Zeppelin, Queen and Elton John. In addition to producing several hits with Donna Summer, Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco hits for The Three Degrees; two albums for Sparks, a handful of songs on Bonnie Tyler's album Bitterblue as well as her 1985 single \"Here She Comes\" and a score of songs for performers including David Bowie, Irene Cara, Madleen Kane, Melissa Manchester, Blondie, Japan, and France Joli.
