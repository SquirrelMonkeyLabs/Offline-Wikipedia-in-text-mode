Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 143 The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 614 says Cynegils and Cwichelm fought at a place named Beandun, which cannot be identified.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 63 & note 2 The account went on to say they slew two thousand sixty-five Welsh.Benjamin Thorpe, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle according to the Several Original Authorities: Translation (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1861), p. 19 Another chronicle entry for 627 (corrected to 626) states an Eomer was sent by \"Cwichelm, king of the West Saxons, thinking to stab king Eadwine\".
