 "text": "Klushino () is a village in Smolensk Oblast, Russia. It is located between Vyazma and Mozhaysk, and is not far from the city of Gzhatsk (now called Gagarin). A major battle of the Polishâ€“Muscovite War took place in Klushino. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in outer space, was born in Klushino in 1934. The house Gagarin was born in is no longer in Klushino. When Gagarin's family moved to Gzhatsk, his father took apart the house. His father then moved the pieces of the house, and put them back together in Gzhatsk. A replica of Gagarin's house was built in Klushino in 1971. The replica house is now a museum. ==References== Category:Rural localities in Russia Category:Smolensk Oblast",
