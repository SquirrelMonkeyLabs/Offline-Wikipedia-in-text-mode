 "text": "The Battle of Cedar Creek was fought near Middletown, Virginia on October 19, 1864. The battle was the decisive engagement of Major General Philip Sheridanâ€™s Valley Campaigns of 1864. It was the largest battle fought in the Shenandoah Valley. Twelve Union Army enlisted men and nine officers were presented the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle. ==Medal of Honor== The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously).
