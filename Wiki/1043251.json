 "text": "The Coonoor bush frog (Raorchestes coonoorensis) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place, in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1,780 and 2083 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog on large farms and in forests that human beings have changed. People saw the frogs sitting on leaves 1-1.5 m over the ground. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and is never a tadpole. The frog is endangered because humans changed the places where it lives too much, for example to build roads and other things for paying visitors. Chemicals meant to kill pests can also kill this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
