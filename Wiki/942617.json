 "text": "Osteocephalus carri is a frog in the family Hylidae. It lives in Colombia. It lives near the Amazon River and a little way up into the Andes mountains. Scientists have seen it as high as 700 meters above sea level. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Osteocephalus buckleyi, but it is not. Scientists watched the frogs and saw the tadpoles of the two species looked different. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
