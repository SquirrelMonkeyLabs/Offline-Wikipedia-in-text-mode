She studied at the Conservatoire de Paris. She began her career as a stage actress and joined the celebrated \"Comédie-Française\" in 1948, aged only 20, one the youngest ever member of the company. During the same time, she was in small roles in movies. She got her first major break when she met French director Louis Malle. He cast her in his movies L'ascenceur pour l'échafaud (1957) and Les amants (1958), which established her as a movie star in France. She also appeared in Roger Vadim's Les liaisons dangereuses (1959) and Peter Brooks's Moderato cantabile (1960), but it is with François Truffaut's iconic movie Jules et Jim (1961) that she became an international star. She then went on to work with directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni (La Notte), Orson Welles (Le procès), Luis Bunuel (The Diary of a Chambermaid), etc. In the 1970s, she attempted directing with Lumières (1976) and L'adolescente (1979) with mixed success.
