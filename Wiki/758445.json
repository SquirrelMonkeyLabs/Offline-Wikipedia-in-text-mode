 "text": "A chaise, sometimes called chay or shay, is a lightweight two- or four-wheeled carriage. It is made for one or two people. It is used for travel or leisure. It has a folding hood or calash top. The name, in use in England before 1700, came from the French word [“chaise”] (meaning “chair”) through a transfer from a sedan-chair to a wheeled vehicle. ==References== Category:Travel",
