Until 2007, only two versions were available: strawberry and summer fruits (a mixed bag of raspberry, blackcurrant and peach). In 2007, a strawberry, cherry, and peach version was released. Campino candies are no longer available in the United Kingdom, but are available in the United States and Canada. ==References== Category:Candy",
