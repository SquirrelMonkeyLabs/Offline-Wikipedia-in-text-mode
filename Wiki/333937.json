It was played on February 5, 2006. It features the Steelers beat the Seahawks, 21-10. Steelers receiver Hines Ward, who caught 5 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Pittsburgh finished the regular season with an 11-5 record and became the fourth wild card team, and third in nine years, to win the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh also became the first #6 seed in the NFL playoffs to win a Super Bowl (and the first #6 seed to win a conference title). The Steelers became the second franchise, following the Oakland Raiders, to appear in the Super Bowl in four different decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s), and the first to appear in four consecutive decades. Also, Steelers runningback Jerome Bettis was able win a Super Bowl thanks to this game. However, many have criticized the officiating in that game, as they believe Seattle was cheated during some questionable calls by referee Bill Leavy. ==References== * Super Bowl referees foul, yet so was everything else- USA Today * Game recap *040 Category:2006 in sports Category:Pittsburgh Steelers Category:2006 in the United States Category:2000s in Detroit",
