 "text": "The Philippines has varied university grading systems. Most colleges, universities, particularly public institutions, follow the grade point system scale of 5.00 - 1.00, in which 1.00 is the highest grade and 5.00 is the lowest possible grade. ==Grade point scale (5.00 - 1.00)== University of the Philippines and Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila Latin Honors Latin Honors Grade Point Equivalence Range Summa Cum Laude 1.01 - 1.20 Magna Cum Laude 1.21 - 1.45 Cum Laude 1.46 - 1.75 Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila also employ a specific grading category for retention. This system uses the General Weighted Average (GWA) per semester as a basis whether or not a particular student shall be retained at the course or college he or she is enrolled to. Some colleges have higher GWA requirement for retention, but most of them demands a GWA of at least 2.50 per semester. A few graduate schools, on the other hand, employ the Pass or Fail system.

This system uses the 4.0 grade point equivalence as the highest grade, while 0.0 grade point equivalence is considered the lowest possible grade. 0.0 grade point equivalence is considered a failing mark.

Different universities have varied equivalence range, while passing grades are subject to imposed academic quality of an institution. == References == ==Related pages== * General Weighted Average * GWA Calculator Grading",
