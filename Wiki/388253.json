 "text": "Cyanosis is a medical problem where the skin changes color. When a person has cyanosis their skin and mucous membranes turn blue or purple. ==Causes== Cyanosis is a sign that the cyanotic (blue) parts of the body are not getting enough oxygen in blood there. This can happen because there is not enough oxygen in the blood. It can also happen when small blood vessels in the body get smaller because of a medical problem, which is called vasoconstriction. ==Manifestations== Cyanosis tends to be seen in the extremities the parts of the body that are farthest away from the heart. Usually, the first parts of the body to become cyanotic are the fingertips (especially under the fingernails), the toes, the lips, the tip of the nose, and the earlobes.Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice Series: Assessment. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 1 edition (2006) p.87 As the body goes longer without oxygen, more parts of the body become cyanotic. ==Related pages== * Circulatory system * Acrocyanosis * Blue baby syndrome * Raynaud's phenomenon * Blue Fugates ==References== == External links == Category:Medical signs Category:Blood disorders",
