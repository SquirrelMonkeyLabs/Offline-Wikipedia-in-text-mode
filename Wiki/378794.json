The starters for X and Y are the Grass-type Pokémon, Chespin, the Fire-type Pokémon, Fennekin, and the Water-type Pokémon, Froakie. The announcement video also showed two new legendary Pokémon, Yveltal,(Yah-val-tal) a bird-like Pokémon which has a shape kind of like the letter Y, and Xerneas, a deer-like Pokémon which has X-shapes in its eyes. Another Pokémon, Sylveon, is both a new Eevee evolution and an entirely new type called the Fairy-type, which is strong against Dragon-type Pokémon. Some older Pokémon, like Jigglypuff, Marill, and Gardevoir, have also been changed to be part Fairy-type. There is also a new gameplay element called Mega Evolution. Some Pokémon like Mewtwo, Blaziken, and Lucario are able to power up during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. Mega forms of Pokémon are stronger than their normal forms. ==References== ==Other websites== *Nintendo's announcement video for Pokémon X and Y Category:2013 video games X and Y Category:Game Freak games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo Network games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in France",
