He has also fought against rap music, mainly because of its obscenity. In July 2008, Thompson was permanently disbarred, meaning his license to be a lawyer was taken away. That was done because of bad behavior and saying things that were not true to tribunals. Thompson was born in Cleveland, Ohio. ==References== Category:Lawyers from Cleveland Category:American activists Category:Businesspeople from Cleveland Category:1951 births Category:Living people",
