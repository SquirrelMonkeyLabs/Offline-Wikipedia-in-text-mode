 "text": "Kiwa hirsuta is a crustacean that was first found on the Pacific Ocean floor in 2005 at 7200 feet deep, 900 miles south of Easter Island in March 2005. It is about 6 inches long, or 15 centimeters. It looks a little like a crab, but its long arms are covered with yellow fur that looks like silk, so its discoverers, from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Insititute, dubbed it the yeti crab or yeti lobster. But it is so different from other crustaceans that it was given its own scientific family, Kiwaidae. == Other websites == * * \"Furry Lobster found in Pacific\" at BBC, 8 March 2006.
