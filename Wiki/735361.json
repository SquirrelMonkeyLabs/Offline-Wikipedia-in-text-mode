They had a daughter, Lieserl, born in 1902, and two sons, Hans-Albert and Eduard. Marić and Einstein separated in 1914. Marić took the boys and returned to Zurich from Berlin. They divorced in 1919. That same year Einstein married again. When he won the Nobel Prize in 1921, he gave the money to Marić to support their sons. She could use the interest earned by the prize money.
