The adult frog is 29.5 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown. There is a dark line between the eyes and some darker brown marks on the back. There is some blue color on the sides of the body. People have seen this frog near streams where the water moves quickly. It cannot live in streams that human beings have changed. The male frog its 3 m above the ground and calls to the female frogs. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because even though it lives in two small places, both those places are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
