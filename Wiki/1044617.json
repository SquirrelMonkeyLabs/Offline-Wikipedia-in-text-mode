 "text": "The American Wirehair is a breed of American cat. They are characterized by their curly, hard fur that covers their entire body. == History == American Wirehair is a natural mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among five litters of kittens born to a pair of barn cats in Vernon, upstate New York, in 1966. The red-and-white male had a dense coat, and the cats' owner called local breeder Joan Ocea to see him. She bought the kitten, along with one of his normal litters of cats, for $50 and started a breeding program. As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada and to Germany, where they were especially popular. The breed bred well and was recognized by the CFA in 1967, and by the Championship in 1978. Wirehaireds have yet to be recognized in England and Australia. == Characteristics == It is characterized by its stiff and frizzy coat. They are few in number and very rare. They are very active and curious. They are very proud and sometimes act intimidated by the presence of other cats. However, they are affectionate and mild-mannered. They are also playful and pampered, and love to play with people and be cuddled. Their coats are frizzy from the kitten stage, but it takes about six months for them to develop a coat similar to that of an adult cat. Although their fur is distinctive, it does not take much effort to care for it, just brushing the coat once a week or so. American Wirehairs have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries. == References == == Other websites == *Cat Fanciers' Association: Breed Profile: American Wirehair *Cat Breeds with Pictures Directory: American Wirehair *Cat Breeds Directory *American Wirehair Guide Category:Cat breeds",
