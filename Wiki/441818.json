She is one of the highest-paid Indian celebrities; she has established a career in Bollywood movies, and is the recipient of two Filmfare Awards. She has been married to Ranveer Singh since 2018. ==Early life== Deepika Padukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen, Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents. Her father, Prakash, is a former badminton player of international repute, and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent. Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer. Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association. The family relocated to Bangalore, India, when Padukone was a year old. She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School, and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College. She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology, but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career. ==Career== Padukone's first screen appearance was in Himesh Reshammiya's music video \"Naam Hai Tera\" in 2005. Padukone made her film debut by playing the titular protagonist in the Kannada film Aishwarya (2006). Her first Hindi film release came the following year with Farah Khan's melodrama Om Shanti Om, in which she played dual roles opposite Shah Rukh Khan. For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and also received a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. Her sole film role in 2008 was as one of Ranbir Kapoor's love interests in Bachna Ae Haseeno. Padukone's first film release of 2009, the kung fu comedy Chandni Chowk to China opposite Akshay Kumar, proved to be a box office flop. However, her next release, Imtiaz Ali's romance Love Aaj Kal grossed worldwide, and garnered her a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Padukone had five film releases in 2010. Her second comedy film in that year, Housefull was a commercial success, though her other four releases (Karthik Calling Karthik, Lafangey Parindey, Break Ke Baad, and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey) that year failed at the box office. The series of poorly received films continued with both her 2011 releases, the drama Aarakshan and the comedy Desi Boyz. The role of an impulsive party-girl in Homi Adajania's Cocktail (2012) proved to be a breakthrough for Padukone. Critics praised her performance and she received several acting nominations for it. The year 2013 was key for Padukone; three of her four releases that year earned over in India. Among these were two of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all timethe romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and the action-comedy Chennai Express. She also won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for portraying Leela, a character based on Juliet, in Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013). In 2014, Padukone appeared in Kochadaiiyaan, an animation film in Tamil, which was shot using motion capture technology. Also that year, she played a young widow in Adajania's Finding Fanny and a bar dancer in the ensemble heist film Happy New Year. The following year, Padukone starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Irrfan Khan in Shoojit Sircar's critically acclaimed comedy-drama Piku (2015). ==Films== Key Denotes films that have not yet been released Title Year Role Director(s) Notes Aishwarya 2006 Aishwarya Kannada film Om Shanti Om 2007 Shantipriya / Sandy Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress Bachna Ae Haseeno 2008 Gayatri Chandni Chowk to China 2009 Sakhi / Meow Meow Billu 2009 Herself Priyadarshan Special appearance in song \"Love Mera Hit Hit\" Love Aaj Kal 2009 Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress Main Aurr Mrs Khanna 2009 Raina Special appearance Karthik Calling Karthik 2010 Housefull 2010 Sandy Lafangey Parindey 2010 Break Ke Baad 2010 Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey 2010 Dum Maaro Dum 2011 Unnamed Special appearance in song \"Dum Maaro Dum Mit Jaaye Gham\" Aarakshan 2011 Desi Boyz 2011 Cocktail 2012 Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress Race 2 2013 Elena Abbas–Mustan Bombay Talkies 2013 Herself Multiple Special appearance in song \"Apna Bombay Talkies\" Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani 2013 Chennai Express 2013 Azhagusundaram Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela 2013 Leela Filmfare Award for Best Actress Kochadaiiyaan 2014 Princess Vadhana Tamil film Animation film Finding Fanny 2014 Angie English language film Happy New Year 2014 My Choice 2015 Herself Short film Piku 2015 Piku Banerjee Tamasha 2015 Post-production Bajirao Mastani 2015 Mastani Nominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actress xXx:Return of Xander Cage 2017 Serena Unger American film Raabta 2017 Special appearance in song \"Raabta\" Padmaavat 2018 Rani Padmavati Zero 2018 Herself Special appearance chhapaak 2020 Malti Meghna Gulzar ==Music video appearances== Title Year Role Performer(s) Album \"Naam Hai Tera\" 2005 Unnamed Himesh Reshammiya Aap Kaa Surroor \"Phir Mile Sur Mera Tumhara\" 2010 Herself Various ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1986 births Category:Indian Hindus Category:Indian models Category:Indian movie actors Category:Living people Category:Actors from Bangalore",
