 "text": "The F3 Derby is a soccer rivalry in the A-League Men, the A-League Women and the A-League Youth. It is played between Central Coast Mariners FC and Newcastle Jets FC. It is the oldest derby in the A-League, and the reason that it is a rivalry is because the two clubs were the only two original clubs based outside a capital city. The rivalry is named after the Pacific Motorway (M1) which connects Newcastle to Sydney via the Central Coast. It was originally called the F3 Freeway.
