 "text": "An air raid is an attack in which bombs are dropped from aircraft on to a ground or sea target. If the area has a civil defense system, operators may send a air raid alert to warn people. It may be a siren or a radio broadcast. People hearing the alert try to go to an air raid shelter for protection. The same warning system may send an \"all clear\" signal when the danger is over.
