 "text": "The Academy of Country Music Awards is an American country music event. ==History== It was first held in 1966. It honoured the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the earliest country music awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature \"hat\" trophy was made in 1968. The awards were first filmed in 1972 on ABC. In 1979, the Academy joined with Dick Clark Productions to make the show. Dick Clark and Al Schwartz served as producers while Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to NBC and finally to CBS, where it remains today. In 2003, the awards show left Los Angeles. It moved to Las Vegas at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. The show is now held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Academy also adopted a sleeker, modern version of the \"hat\" trophy that year. That is now made by New York firm Society Awards. In 2004 the organization started online awards voting for its professional members. It became the earliest televised awards show to do so. ==References== Category:1966 establishments in the United States",
