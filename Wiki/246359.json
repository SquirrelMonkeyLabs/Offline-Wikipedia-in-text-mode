 "text": "Wet-tail or proliferative ileitis, is a disease in rodents kept in cages, mainly hamsters, but can include rabbits, gerbils, rats, and mice. It is caused by stress. Even with treatment, the animal can die within 24â€“48 hours. Baby hamsters are much more likely to get the disease than older hamsters. It commonly is found when the hamster is being weaned at about four weeks of age. ==Causes== Wet-tail is a disease in the animal's intestines caused by the bacteria, Lawsonia intracellularis. Wet-tail is stress related. The stress can be caused by: * Too much handling * Change in environment * Change in diet * Inadequate cage cleaning * Being away from mother and/or siblings * Death of a mate ==Symptoms== The symptoms may not appear for several days. The main symptom is the animal has a wet tail, matted with faeces. Other signs of the disease are: * Smell/ foul odor * Diarrhoea * Lethargy * Lack of appetite * Excess sleeping * Walking with a hunched back ==Treatment== There are drugs to treat wet-tail which can be bought from pet shops. A vet may choose to give the animal other drugs. The sick animal should be kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease. ==References== Category:Rodents Category:Animal diseases",
