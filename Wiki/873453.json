 "text": "The toady leaf frog or terrestrial monkey frog (Calllimedusa atelopoides) is a frog that lives in Bolivia and Peru, but scientists think it may one day live in Colombia and Ecuador too. People have seen it as high as 200 meters above sea level. Unlike most tree frogs, this frog does not live in the water at all when it is an adult. It is brown in color and lives in trees. The adult male frog is cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is long. It is green with orange color on its sides and legs. The irises of its eyes are silver or gray. The male frog sounds like \"wort\" when he sings for the female frog. When it is time to lay eggs, the female frog lays 20 eggs at a time on a leaf and then folds the leaf around the eggs. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water. Scientists believe that this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
