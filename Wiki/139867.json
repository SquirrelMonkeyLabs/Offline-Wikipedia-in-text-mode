 "text": "An eating disorder is when someone begins eating too much, or when someone begins to avoid eating. This affects their mental and physical health. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are two of the most well-known eating disorders today. Nine percent of the U.S. population or 28.8 million Americans will have an eating disorder in their lifetime time. Eating disorders affect all genders, with females being two times more likely to have an eating disorder. Eating disorders and addictions are closely related. Eating disorders involve more than just food. Many people with eating disorders are very sad and feel alone. They might get depressed and eating in front of other people can be stressful for them. Some people eat food to feel better when they are sad, stressed, or upset. They might eat a lot of food in a very short period or throw up their food because they feel guilty. They eat very little because they want to lose weight, even if they are already dangerously underweight (weighing less than what it is considered healthy). Even if they are underweight, they can see themselves as very fat. Many people with eating disorders suffer malnutrition (not getting enough nutrients that the body needs to be healthy), or electrolyte imbalances (a change in the number of elements such as sodium or potassium that causes problems in the body's function). Eating disorders can cause death. ==References== == Other websites == * National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders * National Eating Disorders Association * Effects of Eating Disorders",
