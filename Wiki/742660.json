 "text": "On the night of March 2, 2020, and into the morning of March 3, a series of large tornadoes touched down across middle Tennessee, including a tornado that impacted downtown Nashville and one confirmed touchdown in Western Tennessee between Bradford and Skullbone. 25 people have been confirmed dead, at least 150 are injured, and more than 70,000 people lost power in the storm. The path of the Nashville tornado was very similar to the one that hit East Nashville in 1998. Tornadoes were also reported in southeastern Missouri and western Kentucky. Governor Bill Lee declared a state of emergency for all of Tennessee. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the state on March 6. ==References== Category:Tornadoes in the United States Category:Tornado outbreaks Category:March 2020 events Category:2020 in weather",
