 "text": "A hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates (adds phosphyryl groups) hexoses (six-carbon sugars). It takes in a substrate (usually glucose in most organisms) and adds a phosphate (usually from ATP) to form hexose phosphate as the product. When the substrate is glucose, the product is glucose-6-phosphate. == References == Category:Metabolism Category:Enzymes",
