They had traditional country music and blues music style. The albums got little attention from radio, the media and the public. In 1988, Williams put out her self-titled album. It was named after her. The album had the song \"Passionate Kisses\". Williams won a Grammy Award for the Best Country Song in 1994. Williams recorded and put out only one other album, Sweet Old World in late 1992. But in 1998, success came when she put out an album that had a broader scope of songs that blended rock, country, Americana and blues. Off the album, the song \"Can't Let Go\" was nominated for a Grammy. It is Williams' most successful song so far. The album was marked Gold under the RIAA. Williams, in 2001, recorded and released the album Essence. It was also successful. One of the album's songs, \"Get Right with God\", earned Williams a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 2002. Williams has won three Grammy and two Americana awards. ==References== Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Singers from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Singers from Louisiana Category:1953 births Category:Living people",
