Kieffer claimed that he was wrongfully terminated after requesting accommodations for his disabilities and filing a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The suit ended with the court granting summary judgment in favor of CPR. The court found that Kieffer did not meet the criteria for protection under the FMLA, and he was not considered a \"qualified individual\" under the ADA. The court also ruled that Kieffer's requested leave was not a reasonable accommodation, and his retaliation claims lacked sufficient evidence. The decision was made on unspecified dates in 2018, and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment. ==References== Category:Companies based in New York (state) Category:1998 establishments",
