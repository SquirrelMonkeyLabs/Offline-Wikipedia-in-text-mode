She was born on Saint Barnabas, a neighbouring island to Saint Marie, and enrolled in the police force there where she achieved her sergeant status. However, due to the island's small size and population, Naomi had never worked on a homicide case before joining the force at Saint Marie. She is shown to be very dedicated to her job, a trait that sometimes got in the way of her professionalism, but nevertheless her enthusiasm for the job impresses her fellow officers following Florence's departure from the show midway through series 11, Naomi shows her interest in becoming the new Detective Sergeant, and following discussions with DI Neville Parker and the Commissioner, she is accepted and becomes the new DS. * Darlene Curtis (Ginny Holder) - (S7, E3–7, S11, E5–present) first appeared in Series 7 as a love interest to Officer Dwayne Myers. The two had a sometimes turbulent but nevertheless happy relationship, though following Dwayne's departure from the island at the end of the series, it's assumed their relationship ended and Darlene makes no appearances for the next few series and Darlene returns to the show mid-way through Series 11, and is subsequently offered a role on the team by Commissioner Patterson in a civilian capacity following Florence's departure from the force. She proves to be a good addition to the team, and at the end of the 2022 Christmas special, she reveals that she has applied for Police Officer training so she can join the team in an official capacity. * Dwayne Myers (Danny John–Jules) - (S1, E1–S7, E8, S13, E6–present) was the longest- standing officer of the Saint Marie police force, but utterly lacked ambition, hence he's never became a sergeant. He has complete faith in his seniors and perhaps too good an understanding of the criminal world on the island. Dwayne often uses unlawful means to get his job done, and has an eye for the ladies, sometimes getting distracted when on the job. He is the go-to man for any investigations into the shadier aspects of Saint Marie. It is revealed he has a sister, who locked him in a trunk for three hours when he was five years old; this led to Dwayne developing a secret fear of the dark. His parents divorced when he was very young and his father abandoned him after a few months of weekend visits, leaving Dwayne to grow up on his own following DS Camille Bordey's departure halfway through Series 4, Dwayne became the last remaining original team member, apart from Commissioner Selwyn Patterson. That same episode, young Officer JP Hooper joined the team, with Dwayne taking him under his wing and mentoring him to become a good officer. Dwayne later leaves Saint Marie and the team after the end of Series 7. It's mentioned by Jack Mooney and JP at the start of Series 8 that Dwayne had gone on a voyage with his father, Nelson, with whom he had since become reconciled and dwayne makes a guest appearance in the Christmas special broadcast in 2021, where he returned to the island for Christmas.
