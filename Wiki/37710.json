 "text": "A blood cell is any cell of any type found in blood. There are three main types of blood cells in mammals: *Red blood cell-carries oxygen *White blood cell-kills bacteria and cleans up debris *Platelet-helps heal wounds. Platelets are really thrombocytes. These are small fragments (pieces) of a cell called a megakaryocyte. The platelets take part in blood clots when injury occurs. == Discovery == Jan Swammerdam a scientist from the Netherlands was the first person to observe red blood cells under a microscope. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, another scientist from the Netherlands, was the first to draw an illustration of \"Red Blood Cells\". Category:Cell biology",
