 "text": "Tuojiangosaurus is an armoured dinosaur that lived during the upper Jurassic period approximately 150 million years ago Tuojiangosaurus comes from Szechuan, China. Ancient Chinese records tell of local villagers selling mythical dragon bones to make medicine. These were probably the fossils of Tuojiangosaurus. Tuojiangosaurus wasn't a dragon. It was a dinosaur. To protect it, it had 17 pairs of spiky plates down its back and tail. A frightening set of tail spikes completed this plant-eater's armour. With one deadly swing of its spiked tail Tuojiangosaurus could hurt the belly of an attacking predator. The Chinese province where Tuojiangosaurus was found is home to the Zigong Dinosaur Park, the first dinosaur museum in Asia. Category:Dinosaurs",
