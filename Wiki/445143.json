 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques are: # Arrondissement of Bayonne, (subprefecture: Bayonne), with 123 communes. # Arrondissement of Oloron-Sainte-Marie, (subprefecture: Oloron-Sainte-Marie), with 155 communes. # Arrondissement of Pau, (prefecture of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department: Pau), with 269 communes. ==History== Since its creation, the Pyrénées- Atlantiques department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the Basses- Pyrénées department with six districts: Pau, Oloron, Orthez, Mauléon, Saint- Palais, Ustaritz; the capital was Navarrenx * 1790 : the capital is moved from Navarrenx to Pau * 1795 : the capital is moved from Pau to Saint-Palais * 1796 : the capital is moved from Saint-Palais to Pau * 1800 : creation of the arrondissements: Pau, Bayonne, Mauléon, Oloron, Orthez * 1926 : the arrondissements of Mauléon and Orthez are eliminated * 1969 : the name of the department is changed to Pyrénées-Atlantiques ==References== Pyrenees- Atlantiques",
