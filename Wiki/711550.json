 "text": "Bhagalpur, also called Champa Nagari in the past, is a city in Bihar, India. It is located on the southern side of the Ganges River and is the third biggest city in Bihar. It is the main city of Bhagalpur district and division. Bhagalpur is famous for making silk, so people call it the \"Silk City.\" The Indian government has included it in the Smart Cities Mission for better development. After Patna, it is the only place in Bihar with three big colleges: IIT Bhagalpur, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, and TMBU, along with an agriculture university. A new university, Vikramshila Central University, is being built near the old ruins of Vikramshila Mahavihara. The Bhagalpur Railway Station connects the city to other places. The Ganges River near Bhagalpur is home to the Gangetic dolphin, which is India's national aquatic animal. There is a special protected area called Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary to help keep the dolphins safe. Bhagalpur has big celebrations, including the largest Manasa Puja and one of the biggest Kali Puja processions in the region. These events are important cultural traditions. == Flora and fauna == === Greater adjutant (Garuda) === The Greater Adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius) is a large stork, connected to the mythical bird Garuda. Bhagalpur in Bihar has the second-largest Rescue and Rehabilitation area for this endangered species. Their population declined because of habitat loss, pollution, hunting, and egg collection. The birds were first seen breeding in Bihar in 2007, when they nested on a silk cotton tree in the Ganga-Diara area. Before that, they had never been recorded breeding in Bihar. In 2006, a team from Mandar Nature Club saw 42 of these birds in the region for the first time. Their numbers grew over the next few years, increasing from 78 to over 500. Today, Bhagalpur is one of only three places where Greater Adjutants are found, alongside Cambodia and Assam. The greater adjutant is an endangered species, listed on the IUCN Red List and protected under India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. It is a large stork with a bald pink head, a thick yellow bill, and a long hanging neck pouch. The white neck ruff contrasts with its dark grey body, making it resemble a vulture. Its wings have pale grey edges, while young birds have darker wings, a narrower bill, and thicker feathers on the head and neck. This bird can grow up to 145–150 cm (about three feet) in length and stand between four to five feet tall. == Demographics == As of the 2011 census, Bhagalpur's urban area had a population of 410,210, making it the third-largest city in Bihar. Among them, 218,284 were men and 191,926 were women. The city had 55,898 children aged 0 to 6 years. In terms of literacy, 286,125 people could read and write—160,720 men and 125,405 women. The overall literacy rate for people aged 7 and above was 80.76%, with men at 84.95% and women at 75.95%. === Religion === Hinduism is the majority religion in Bhagalpur City with about 70% of the population following it, than followed by Islam with 29% adherants. It also has a small minority of Jains and Christians. === Language === Bhagalpur is an important location where Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal meet. Historically, it was the capital of Anga Pradesh and played a key role in independence under Tilkamanjhi. Over time, the region has become a center for different languages and cultures. Many communities, including Biharis, Bengalis, Marwaris, Muslims, Santalis, and Pahadis, live here, making it a diverse and culturally rich area. However, Angika language is primarily spoken in the district. Apart from Angika, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu and Santhali are prominent languages of the region. It is a multilingual district and has been a centre of development for many languages during the ancient era in the Vikramshila University. == Culture == Bhagalpur has a deep cultural heritage that has lasted for centuries. The ancient city, once known as Champanagari, is famous for its silk industry and trade. It thrives in its festivals, art, food, and commerce, reflecting its cultural richness. The region follows the \"Aangi\" or \"Angika\" traditions, which add to its unique identity. It is home to a diverse community, blending different customs and traditions. As an important center in Anga, later Bengal, and now Bihar, Bhagalpur has embraced, respected, and promoted various cultures, preserving its historical and cultural richness. === Kali Puja === Kali Puja is one of the most significant festivals in Bhagalpur and the surrounding region. On Deepawali, many Kali temples and Puja Mandaps are beautifully decorated to honor Goddess Kali. After the Puja, the Murti Bisarjan (idol immersion) procession is so grand that it takes 36 hours to complete one major phase. The Shobhayatra (procession) of Bhagalpur Kali Puja marked its 71st year in 2024, highlighting its long-standing cultural tradition in the Anga region. The post-Puja procession is considered an intangible cultural treasure of the city, showcasing the deep devotion and rich heritage of Bhagalpur. === Behula Bishari === Manasa Puja, also called \"Bishari Puja,\" is a traditional folk festival in Bhagalpur, once known as Champanagari or Champaknagari, the capital of Anga Mahajanapada. The festival honors Maa Mansa, the Guardian Goddess, and her renunciation. Every year, the city also celebrates the legendary wedding of Behula and Lakhinder during the puja, reflecting the deep cultural and mythological roots of the region. In medieval Bengali literature, particularly in Mansamangal, Behula is portrayed as both a heroine and a goddess. Between the 13th and 18th centuries, many works were created based on her story, originally meant to emphasize the importance of Goddess Manasa. However, these stories became more famous for showcasing the deep devotion and love between Behula and her husband, Lakhinder (Lakhander or Lakshinder). During Manasa Puja, local women sing folk songs in Angika and offer Manjusha—special decorative offerings—to the Goddess. Interestingly, this tale is not just seen as mythology. There are reports that the metal house built by Vishvakarma under Chand Saudagar’s order to protect Behula and Lakhinder from snake bites can still be seen when heavy rains occur in the region. == River == There are many rivers which cross the Bhagalpur Border.
