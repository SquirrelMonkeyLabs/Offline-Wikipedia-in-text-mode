 "text": "\"Pretty Vacant\" is a song by the English punk rock band The Sex Pistols. It was released in 1977, as the third single from their album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. The song is infamous for vocalist John Lydon's phrasing of the word \"vacant\", emphasizing the last syllable making it sound like the vulgar word \"cunt\".Jon Savage, England's Dreaming. Sex Pistols and Punk Rock. London, Faber and Faber, 1991 0-571-16791-8, p. 378. The B-side is a cover of The Stooges' \"No Fun\" which they played on the spot without a proper rehearsal. ==References== Category:1977 songs Category:Sex Pistols songs",
