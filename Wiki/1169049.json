 "text": "The Alagoas rocket frog, Guanabara rocket frog, Linhares rocket frog, or Rio rocket frog (Allobates olfersioides) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Body== The adult frog is 11.5 - 18.8 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's belly is cream-white in color. There is a dark stripe from the nose or eyes to where the back legs meet the body. The back legs are brown in color with darker stripes. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color, the same as the legs, with darker marks in the shape of the letter X. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives on the ground in rainforests that have never been cut down and rainforests that were destroyed and are growing back. They live on the dead leaves on the ground near streams. Scientists saw the frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in many protected parks, for example Parque Nacional da Serra da Bocaina. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to puddles of water. People have seen male frogs carry tadpoles. The tadpoles can be 23.3 mm long with the tail and 7.8 mm long not counting the tail. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in not danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms, to make tree farms, to make places for animals to eat grass, to get wood to build with, and to make roads. Scientists do not think habitat loss is the only reason there are fewer of these frogs than there were. In the 1970s and 1980s, many of the frogs died. Scientists found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on some frogs near Rio de Janiero. B dendrobatidis causes the disease chytridiomycosis, which can kill frogs. Scientists are not sure if chytridiomycosis killed these frogs. The frogs that live in Bahia live near a bromeliad plant called Hohenbergia littoralis. This plant is in danger of dying out because people come into the forest to take them away. If the plant dies, the frog could die too. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
