Fettuccine Alfredo has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants in the United States and internationally, although in Italy this dish is not popular at all, as wrongly believed, and it is better known if called \"Fettuccine al burro\" instead of \"Fettuccine Alfredo\". ==History== Fettuccine Alfredo is named for Alfredo di Lelio, an Italian restaurant owner. He ran a restaurant in Rome in the first half of the 20th century. In 1914, his wife, who was pregnant, was having difficulty eating so he adapted a meal of pasta and butter, pasta al burro, for her. Later, he put the dish on the menu at his restaurant, the Alfredo alla Scrofa, and called his version Fettuccine Alfredo. Hollywood celebrities Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks visited his restaurant on their honeymoon and eat the dish. When they returned home, they talked often about the dish. This caused the restaurant and the dish to become popular with American tourists. In 1943, Di Lelio sold the restaurant but kept the right to the name and menu. In 1950, Alfredo Di Lelio reopened a new restaurant \"Il Vero Alfredo\" in Rome, Piazza Augusto Imperatore 30. He worked there until his death in 1959. \"Il Vero Alfredo\" is now managed by his nephews Alfredo and Ines, with the famous “gold cutlery”” (fork and spoon gold) donated in 1927 by two well-known American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (in gratitude for the hospitality). ==References== * Category:Dishes named after people Category:Pasta Category:Italian food",
