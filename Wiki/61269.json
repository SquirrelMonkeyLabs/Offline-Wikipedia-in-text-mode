 "text": "Roberto Luongo (born April 4, 1979) is a Canadian former ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). Luongo retired from the NHL in 2019 after playing for 19 seasons. == Playing career == Roberto Luongo started playing in the NHL with the Florida Panthers. During the summer of 2006, Luongo was planning to stay in Florida. Instead, the general manager of the Panthers, Mike Keenan, sent him to the Vancouver Canucks, along with Lukas Krajicek, in return for Todd Bertuzzi, Alex Auld, and Bryan Allen. Luongo first said that he was sad because he was leaving so suddenly and Vancouver was very far away. In the 2007 season, Luongo was in Vancouver. He was voted into the All-Star Game as the starting goaltender. The Canucks went to the playoffs. It was Luongo's first time to reach the playoffs. In one game, against the Dallas Stars, he made around 70 saves, which is very close to breaking records. On March 4, 2014, a day before the NHL trade deadline, the Canucks traded Luongo along with prospect Steven Anthony to the Florida Panthers for goaltender Jacob Markström and centre Shawn Matthias. Luongo's salary will still be retained by the Canucks. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Acadie–Bathurst Titan players Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Olympic gold medalists for Canada Category:Florida Panthers players Category:Ice hockey people from Quebec Category:Louisville Panthers players Category:Lowell Lock Monsters players Category:New York Islanders players Category:People from Montreal Category:Val-d'Or Foreurs players Category:Vancouver Canucks players",
