 "text": "There is no official Libertarian manifesto like The Communist Manifesto advocating for communism. There are books such as For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto by Murray Rothbard advocating for anarcho-capitalism, or New Libertarian Manifesto which advocates for left-libertarianism. ==Libertarian manifesto mantras== Libertarian manifesto mantras generally advocate for: * Individual freedom over collectivism * Capitalism over socialsim or crony capitalism * Meritocracy, egalitarianism, and social equality over social equity * Flatter organizational anarchy over hierarchy * Non-aggression principle over force or coercion * Non-interventionism over interventionism * Personal responsibility over welfare dependency or a spoils system * Local governments over central government * Private property over nationalized collective ownership * Voluntary association over forced collectivism or forced altruism * Freedom of speech over government censorship * Democracy over authoritarian or totalitarian tyranny * Free market competition over a government-granted monopoly or state monopoly * Open societies with radical transparency over a closed society * Secularism over government theology ==Taxes== Libertarianism views taxation as theft because it violates the non-aggression principle because it uses force or coercion to achieve the objective of collecting taxes, which violates the social contract. ==Monetary policy== ===Gold Standard=== Many libertarians advocate for a return to the Gold standard, but it is a flawed assumption because trying to return to the Gold Standard after WW1 in the late 1920s was the cause of the Great Depression, it was from tight monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and Central banks around the world that threw everyone out of work from a lack of demand in the economy, in order to get the gold convertibility rates back on track to pre WW1 levels, when the gold standards were suspended to help finance the war with dovish monetary policy. There was also a lot of hyperinflation in the early 1920s around the world. Herbert Hoover was a wealthy gold miner before he got into politics and he had assets tied up in gold mining around the world,https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/hall-of- fame/herbert-hoover/ inflation was financially hurting people who owned gold and gold assets, because the gold standards were suspended and the convertibility rates were undervalued. Franklin D. Roosevelt in the first month of his presidency did Executive Order 6102 which made owning gold illegal and forced citizens to sell their gold to the treasury at $20.67 per ounce. ===Libertarian Monetary Policy=== The Federal Government has the authority to create money under the Coinage clause in the Enumerated powers of Article 1 : Section 8 of the United States Constitution. The treasury does not exercise this authority and the money creation process is actually done by the banks in our debt based monetary system, where banks create the new money and issue it as debt also known as the principal, they also destroy money when the principal is being repaid, banks only keep the interest. It is essentially margin investing but the bank created the margin and therefore they do not have to pay interest on the margin, therefore banks are highly leveraged, and this creates the economic bubbles that the Federal Reserve has to pop with Quantitative tightening which causes recessions and depressions, because of lack of demand to get prices down. Instead of banks creating new money the treasury should create the new money as revenue for the Federal Government, that way the Central Governments don't have to tax working citizens for their revenue. It could be very open and transparent and everyone could see everyday, week, or month how much money is being created and spent by the government. It is an alternative to Modern Monetary Theory which advocates for the Central Governments to create too much money and then tax out the excess so there isn't too much inflation. Libertarian Monetary Theory would create the right amount money, for government revenue and to spend, with the goal of causing little to no inflation. ==See also== * Natural law and Natural rights * Austrian school of economics * Cronyism ==References==",
