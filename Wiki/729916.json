He was best known for his television work on Most Haunted, shown on Living TV (2002–2010). Although he had a successful career in television, many people doubted Acorah's claims as a medium. He also starred in Derek Acorah's Ghost Towns from 2005 to 2006. He also starred in Celebrity Big Brother in 2017. Acorah was born in Bootle, Liverpool. He was a footballer earlier in his life.
