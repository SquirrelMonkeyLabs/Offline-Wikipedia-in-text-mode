 "text": "An accessory spleen, also called a splenunculus or a splenule, is a small nodule of splenic tissue found outside the main spleen. They are found in approximately 10 percent of the world's population. Splenules can form either by the result of birth defects or trauma. Accessory spleens are medically significant in that they result in errors in medical imaging or continued symptoms after splenectomy. Polysplenia is a birth defect in which there are multiple accessory spleens. == Significance == During medical imaging, accessory spleens can be confused for enlarged lymph nodes or neoplasms in the tail of the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands or gonads. == Gallery == File:Gross pathology of an accessory spleen.jpg|Gross pathology of an accessory spleen File:Splenunculus (accessory spleen) photomicrograph.JPG|Histologic section of an accessory spleen File:Nebenmilz.jpg|Ultrasonography of an accessory spleen == References == Category:Lymphatic system == Other websites == * http://search.medscape.com/emedicine- search?newSearch=1&queryText;=%22accessory+spleen%22 * Image at brown.edu",
