 "text": "Bimbisāra, known in Buddhist texts by that name and as Shrenika or Seniya in Jain traditions, was the king of Magadha. He ruled sometime between 543–492 BCE or 457–405 BCE, depending on different sources. He belonged to the Haryanka dynasty and was the son of King Bhattiya. Bimbisāra expanded his kingdom by conquering nearby regions like Anga in the east. This expansion helped set the stage for the rise of the Maurya Empire later on. According to Jain tradition, Bimbisāra is believed to be the first of the 24 future Tirthankaras in the coming cosmic age and will be called Padmanabha or Mahapadma. He often visited the Samavasarana (divine preaching hall) of Lord Mahavira to ask spiritual questions. In Buddhist tradition, Bimbisāra is remembered for his cultural contributions and was a close friend and supporter of the Buddha. The Chinese monk Xuanzang, who visited India in the 7th century, wrote that Bimbisāra built the city of Rajgir (also called Rajagriha). After his reign, his son Ajatashatru became king.ISBN:978-1-134-50165-6. == References == Category:490s BC deaths Category:550s BC births",
