Kokushi gensaisha are also called kokushi shozaisha or \"shrines that appear in the Official Histories\". These shrines are important because they have a historical significance and are regarded as ancient shrines. Some of the shrines listed in the Jinmyōchō (Register of Deities) in Engishiki, also known as Myojin Taisha also overlap with the kokushi genzaisha, but the term usually refers to shrines that are only mentioned in the Official Histories. 国史 (Kokushi) means official history, 見在 gensai means appearing and 社 sha means shrine == References ==",
