He played for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, between 1959 and 1965. ==Career== Conway began playing professionally for the first time with Otago in 1957. He went on to play 72 games for Bay of Plenty from 1962 to 1968, and was captain of the team. Conway began playing for the All Blacks in 1959. In 1960, he had a finger amputated so he could take part in a tour of Australia and South Africa. This was because he always kept injuring his finger while playing. He broke his finger before the Australia-South Africa tour began and his doctor said if he wanted to keep playing rugby, he would have to amputate it or otherwise it would keep breaking. Conway worked as a carpenter, and he coached rugby during the 1970s. ==Personal life== Conway was born in Whakatāne, New Zealand on 22 April 1935. He studied at Whakatane High School. Conway died in Whakatāne on 25 May 2022 at the age of 87. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1935 births Category:2022 deaths Category:New Zealand rugby union players",
