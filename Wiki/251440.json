 "text": "Propithecus is the genus of the sifakas. They are a genus of lemur in Madagascar. Nine species have been identified. They cannot run on all four legs because their legs are much longer than their arms. Instead, they bounce along the forest floor, jumping from one foot to the other, holding their arms up in the air. Some of them are critically endangered species. == References == Category:Lemuriformes",
