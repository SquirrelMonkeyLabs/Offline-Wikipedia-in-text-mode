 "text": "Biodegradable plastic is a type of plastic that can be decomposed by the action of living organisms, usually microbes, into water, Carbon dioxide, and biomass. These plastics are commonly produced with microorganisms, petrochemicals, and renewable raw materials, or can be made by combining all three. Biodegradable plastics are commonly used for disposable items, such as packaging, cutlery, and food service containers. Many biodegradable plastics are designed to degrade in industrial composting systems. However, this requires a well-managed waste system to ensure that this happens. This plastic is used for packaging food, cosmetics, and films. ==References== Category:Polymers",
