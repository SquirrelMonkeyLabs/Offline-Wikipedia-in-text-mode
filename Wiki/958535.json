 "text": "The green bromeliad frog, Jamaican green tree frog, or Wilder's tree frog (Osteopilus wilderi) is a frog. It lives in Jamaica. Scientists have seen between 120 and 880 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 24.3 to 27.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 24.2 to 29.2 mm long. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and a little webbed skin on the back feet. This frog is usually yellow-green in color but it can be red- brown in color. The belly is lighter in color. Some frogs have spots on their sides. This frog lives in bromeliad plants. Bromeliads are plants that can live on the ground or high up on other plants. Rainwater collects in the leaves of the bromeliads. The frogs lay their eggs in this water. The first tadpoles to hatch eat the other eggs. Scientists think the tadpoles may also eat each other. Osteopilus brunneus tadpoles do eat green bromeliad frog tadpoles if they are in the same plant. But Osteopilus brunneus lays its eggs in larger bromeliad plants, and the green bromeliad frog lays its eggs in smaller ones. Scientists think green bromeliad frogs do this so that the Osteopilus brunneus tadpoles will not eat their young. The green bromeliad frog lives in tropical forests and subtropical forests. The adult frog eats insects. It eats leafhoppers. This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live to build houses and to collect wood for building. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
