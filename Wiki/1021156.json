 "text": "The R142A is the second order of New Technology Trains that operates on the A Division of the New York City Subway. These units were manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in the United States at Yonkers, New York and Lincoln, Nebraska, and in Japan at Kobe, Hy≈çgo. The first R142As were delivered on December 20, 1999. Following their introduction to the system, the R142As experienced minor issues while undergoing testing but was placed into a 30-day revenue acceptance test on July 10, 2000. After successful completion, the R142As began to enter revenue service along the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (4 & 6) on November 2, 2000. In 2011-2016, 380 R142A units were retrofitted with CBTC (Communications Based Train Control) and were subsequently converted into the R188s and ran along the IRT Flushing Line (7 & <7>). The remainder of the R142A fleet were proposed with mid-life upgrades and refurbished as part of the 2017-2021 New York City Transit Crisis. Category:New York City Subway",
