 "text": "Georgian Americans () are Americans of full or partial Georgian ancestry. They include ethnic Georgians who have immigrated to the U.S. from Georgia, as well as other areas with large Georgian populations, such as Russia. The exact number of Americans of Georgian descent is unknown. This is because 19th and 20th century U.S. immigration records often did not differentiate between various ethnic groups originating from the Russian Empire, of which Georgia was part until 1918. ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in the United States",
