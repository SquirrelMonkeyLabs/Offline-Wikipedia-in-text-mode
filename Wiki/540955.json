The area was first settled in 1681. Most of the early residents were Dutch. General George Washington and his troops marched through the county on several occasions and slept in many of the homes located throughout the area. Somerset County also played an important part during both World War I and World War II with weapons depots and the manufacturing of the army's woolen blankets. Somerset County was primarily an agricultural county. In the late 19th century, the county saw many wealthy people come to live. The area is still the home of several wealthy people who were in the pharmaceutical industry.Clemence, Sara. \"Home of the Week: Peapack Palace\" , Forbes, March 14, 2005.
