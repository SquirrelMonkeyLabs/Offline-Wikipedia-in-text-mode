 "text": "Barbiturate overdose is a form of poisoning caused by someone taking too many barbiturates within a short time. ==Symptoms== Those who have overdosed on barbiturates can show some of the following symptoms: * Difficulty thinking * Poor coordination * Lowered effort to breathe * Lowered level of consciousness ==Complications== In serious cases, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can occur. The patient can die from a lack of breathing. The amount of barbiturates that can cause death depends on how much someone's body can break down the drug. The larger the dose of barbiturates someone has taken for a long period, the higher the amount of barbiturates is needed to cause death. This phenomenon is called drug tolerance. ==Mechanism== Barbiturates increase the time that the chloride pore of the GABAA receptor is opened, thereby increasing GABA's efficacy. In contrast, benzodiazepines increase the frequency with which the chloride pore is opened, thereby increasing GABA's potency. ==Treatment== Barbiturate overdose can be treated by activated charcoal. Hemodialysis is also sometimes performed. In cases where the poisoned person is not breathing, mechanical ventilation is required while detoxication is performed. ==Related pages== * Toxicology * Paracetamol poisoning * Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome ==References== Category:Disorders Category:Medical emergencies",
