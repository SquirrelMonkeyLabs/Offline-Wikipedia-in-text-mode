Springer It flows through the areas of Puthimari, Medhikuchi, Pathsala, Dhumarkur, Bhawanipur, Kayakuchi and the Barpeta district. Frequent rains in monsoon season often make the Pahumara river flood in many places, such as paddy fields (underwater fields for growing rice) and roads in the Bahari sub- division of the Barpeta district. During this time the river is quite dangerous. Sometimes the river floods when the Kurichhu hydroelectric plant in Bhutan opens its dam.Parasher, Utpal (25 July 2019). \"Assam on alert after Bhutan releases excess water from hydro power dam\".
