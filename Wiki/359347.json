 "text": "An American spadefood toad is one of a family of toads known as Scaphiopodidae. They live in North America, in southern Canada and USA south to southern Mexico. Scaphiopodidae is a small family with only seven species. The American spadefoot toads are of typical shape to most digging frogs. They are round, with short legs and eyes that stick out. This frog has a hard growth on their feet which helps them to dig. They dig backwards into the ground. The American spadefoot toads live on land when not under ground. They are dully coloured, usually a grey or dull green or brown. This is to help in camouflage. ==References== ==Other websites== *Scaphiopodidae at Tree of Life Category:Frogs of North America",
