 "text": "In Utero is the third and last studio album by the American rock band Nirvana. DGC Records released it on September 21, 1993. Nirvana wanted the album to be different from their last album Nevermind and have a less clean sound. The album was recorded at Pachyderm Studios in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The band recorded it in two weeks with producer Steve Albini. Producer Scott Litt also made small changes to the sound that Albini had produced. When the album was released, it went into the Billboard 200 at number one and was well liked by critics. Since its release, the album has sold over 15 million copies. == Track listing == == References == Category:Nirvana (band) albums Category:1993 albums",
