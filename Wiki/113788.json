 "text": "Emergency contraception is a form of contraception that can be taken by the woman after sex. Emergency contraception can not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency contraception may prevent a pregnancy. It is also known as morning-after pill. Emergency contraception needs to be applied (taken) soon after the unprotected sex. If it is not applied within about 3 days (72 hours) after the event, it will no longer help to prevent pregnancy. The sooner the drug is taken after unprotected sex, the more effective it is. Most emergency contraception methods use hormones. This is similar to some of the other forms of contraception for women. Despite this, emergency contraception should not be used in the place of regular contraception pills. == As a drug == The drugs that are used for emergency contraception are based on hormones. Often the drugs are available in pharmacies. In some countries, the affected person needs to talk to a healthcare professional (a doctor or a pharmacist). After this counseling, the drugs can be obtained. == How they act == The contraception works via the following mechanisms (ways that they act): * Stopping or delaying ovulation, the ovaries from releasing an egg or ovum; * Preventing sperm from fertilising any egg already released; or * Stopping a fertilised egg from attaching itself to the lining of the womb. == How good they work == It is estimated that these drugs (their efficacy) may prevent 85% of expected pregnancies. === Stages of development (pregnancy) === The drugs will not work if the woman is already pregnant. The drugs will also not work for preventing pregnancy from unprotected sex again in the same menstrual cycle. == Abortion == Emergency contraception is not a form of abortion. Abortion is only possible when a pregnancy has started. This means that the ovum has been fertilized, and that it has attached itself to the lining of the womb. === Contraception === Contraception is about preventing a pregnancy. There are certain pills, for example those containing Mifepristone which are taken as a form of abortion. ==Related pages== * Rape * Contraception, and miscarriage (a form of abortion) == Other websites == * WHO Factsheet on Emergency contraception * The Emergency Contraception Website (not-2-late.com) – by the Office of Population Research at Princeton University and the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals * International Consortium for Emergency Contraception * Go 2 EC – Emergency Contraception News * The Morning-After Pill Conspiracy – A United States group whose goal is to have Plan B available over the counter (not just behind pharmacy counters) to women of all ages. * Emergency contraception by the Adolescent Medecine Committee, Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), Paediatrics and Child Health ACSA-CAAH == References == category:medicine Category:Contraception Category:Pregnancy and childbirth Category:Antinatalism",
