The kids are seen working hard in their activities and building friendships. The phrase \"bug juice\" is a camping slang word for a very sweet juice drink made from powdered mixes, such as Kool-Aid. This is often served at summer camps. After the show ended, Bug Juice did not appear on Disney Channel until the summer of 2004. The first season was shown and the last episode aired on August 20, 2004. This was the last time it was on Disney Channel.
