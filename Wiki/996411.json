 "text": "Seth MacFarlane's torrent frog (Hyloscirtus sethmacfarlanei) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador in forests. Scientists have seen it in the Machay Reserve on Cerro Mayordomo. Scientists saw it 2970 meters above sea level. The adult female frog is about 72 mm long from nose to rear end. Adult frogs are black with orange or red spots. Young frogs are yellow. Scientists saw this frog sitting in bromeliad plants 60 - 90 cm over the forest floor. This frog has poison on its skin. The scientists believes this is so other animals that want to eat it will be sick if they try to eat it. Or it may make the frog taste bad. They think the frog's colors warn animals that the poison is there. When human beings touched the frog, their skin hurt for hours. The scientists named this frog after television writer Seth MacFarlane. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
