Their works include the wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin and the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris, the artwork called Running Fence in Sonoma and Marin counties in California, and The Gates in New York City's Central Park. Christo was born in Gabrovo, present-day Bulgaria. Jeanne-Claude was born in Casablanca, present-day Morocco. They met in Paris in 1958. In 1964, they moved to New York City where they began their joint art career. Their works were given credit to \"Christo\" only, until 1994, when the outdoor works and large indoor were credited to \"Christo and Jeanne-Claude\". They flew in separate planes: in case one crashed, the other could continue their work. Jeanne-Claude died, aged 74, on November 18, 2009 in New York City, from problems caused by a brain aneurysm. Christo died on May 31, 2020, of natural causes in New York City, aged 84. ==References== Category:1935 births Jeanne-Claude Christo Jeanne-Claude Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Jeanne-Claude Christo Category:American sculptors Category:American painters Category:Duos Category:Artists from New York City",
