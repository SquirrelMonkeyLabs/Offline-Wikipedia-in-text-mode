 "text": "Boards of guardians ran the Poor Law system in England, Wales and Ireland from 1835 to 1930. They took over from parishes. Boards administered workhouses within a poor law union which was a group of parishes. The guardians were elected by the owners and occupiers of land in the parish who had to pay the poor rate. The Public Health Act 1875 gave them the job of managing drains and water. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom Category:1835 establishments",
