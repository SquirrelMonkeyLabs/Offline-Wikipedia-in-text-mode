 "text": "Hans Biezen (3 July 1947 – 17 December 2024) was a Dutch photographer. ==Biography== Born in 1947, Biezen was trained as a sculptor. In photography, he was autodidact. Biezen initially focused on making pohtographs on \"beautiful\" and \"strong\" photossituations. He realized that the condition 'beautiful' was a limitation of possibilities, and reduced his photography to a mainly documentary form. His first exposition was Foto's van Jet in 1975 at the Van Abbemuseum after taking picures of the most important daily events of his wife Jet from January 1969 until 1975. Biezen continued with picture stories and street photography. He had expositions in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Later he focused in his works on light and space. Works of Biezen are among others in the collections of CODA Museum, Van Abbemuseum, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and Museum van Bommel van Dam. Biezen moved to Östersund, Sweden in 1995. He died there on 17 December 2024, at the age of 77. ==References== ==Other websites== * Career description Category:Dutch photographers Category:1947 births Category:2024 deaths Category:People from Tilburg Category:Dutch artists",
