 "text": "TR-069 is a protocol that is mainly used for the communication with end-user devices, such as DSL modems. The number of such devices is rising steadily, and they are often very difficult to configure. For that reason, TR-069 allows to configure these modems remotely. This also poses problems, because it allows to change the configuration the managed device as well as other devices, which may be behind a firewall. Since the users are not aware of the configuration changes, TR-069 can be used to introduce a backdoor. This backdoor might allow a \"remote search\" by police or legal authorities of a country. ==TR069 Open source implementations== *EasyCwmp opensource implementation of the TR069 cwmp client developed with C/SHELL ==Other websites== *TR-069 Issue 1 Amendment 6 CPE WAN Management Protocol v1.4 *CPE WAN Management Protocol CWMP XML Schemas and Data Model Definitions *Marketing Report TR-069 Deployment Scenarios, Issue: 1, August 2010 *Specification of Technical Report 069 Specification of Technical Report 069 *TR-069 Protocol vs. SNMP Protocol *CPE Requirements for TR-069 Interoperability Category:Telecommunications",
