Michael Morpurgo grew up in London during a war there. He was a teacher, but the book Poetry in the Making by Ted Hughes, made him decide to write instead of teaching. He is the author of over one hundred books, mostly for children, many of which have given many prizes and awards. Five of his books have been made into films. My Friend Walter (1988) and Out of the Ashes (2001) have both been made into television. ==Works== *It Never Rained: Five Stories (1974) *Living Poets (compiler with Clifford Simmons) (1974) *Long Way Home (1975) *Thatcher Jones (1975) *The Story-Teller (compiler with Graham Barrett) (1976) *Friend or Foe (1977) *Do All You Dare (1978) *What Shall We Do with It?
