 "text": "\"Break My Soul\" (written in all capital letters) is a 2022 song by American singer Beyoncé. The song was released June 20, 2022. It is the lead single from her seventh studio album, Renaissance (2022). The song samples the 1992 house song \"Show Me Love\" by Robin S, which was written by Allen George and Fred McFarlane, with background vocals from New Orleans bounce rapper Big Freedia and a sample of Freedia's song \"Explode\". \"Break My Soul\" was co- produced by Beyoncé, The-Dream, and Tricky Stewart. Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Pitchfork said the song shows \"Beyoncé as an SSRI [antidepressant]\" and that Beyoncé is \"acknowledging the predicament in which many of her non- zillionaire listeners find themselves.\" On August 8, 2022, Billboard announced that \"Break My Soul\" was at the top of the Hot 100 for the week ending August 13. It is Beyoncé's eighth US solo chart-topper (twelfth when counted as a member of Destiny's Child). The song spent two weeks at number one. == Remix == A remix with Madonna, taking samples from Madonna's \"Vogue\" (1990), was released August 6, 2022, and titled the \"Queens Remix\". In the bridge of the Queens Remix, Beyoncé name-drops Black female entertainers such as Jill Scott, Lizzo, Rihanna, Whitney Houston, Grace Jones, and Nicki Minaj. == Charts == ===Weekly charts=== Chart performance for \"Break My Soul\" Chart (2022) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 6 Bulgaria 23 Canada (Canadian Hot 100) 4 Canada CHR/Top 40 (Billboard) 12 Ireland (IRMA) 1 US Billboard Hot 100 1 US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) 8 US Rhythmic (Billboard) 2 US Hot R&B-Hip;/Hop Songs (Billboard) 1 US R&B;/Hip-Hop Airplay 3 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2022) Position US Billboard Hot 100 38 == Awards and nominations == Grammy Awards Ceremony Category Result 65th (2023) Best Dance/Electronic Recording Song of the Year Record of the Year Best Remixed Recording Terry Hunter Remix ==References== Category:2022 songs Category:Beyoncé songs Category:House songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:R&B; songs",
