 "text": "Irina Sabine Alice Karamanos Adrian (born 29 October 1989) is a Chilean anthropologist and political scientist. She was the partner of Gabriel Boric, the President of Chile. She became first lady and Director of the Sociocultural Area of the Presidency on 11 March 2022. Karamanos is the leader of the feminist wing of her political party, Social Convergence. ==First Lady== At first, both she and Boric were against the role of First Lady, with Karamanos saying \"I think it is a role we need to rethink because we live in different times and a lot has changed. We need to rethink the power and the relationships that emerge from it.\" However, Karamanos later said that she would take the role and change it, and she would focus on transgender issues and child migration. This decision was controversial with feminist groups in Chile. Boric and Karamanos announced the end of their relationship in November 2023. ==Personal life== Her grandparents were born in Kymi, Greece, and she speaks Spanish, Greek, English and German. Boric and Karamanos lived in Punta Arenas. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official twitter account Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:First Ladies of Chile Category:Writers from Santiago Category:Anthropologists Category:Political scientists Category:Feminists Category:Chilean activists",
