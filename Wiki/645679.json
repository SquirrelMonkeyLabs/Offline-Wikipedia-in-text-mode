He is best known for the Lewis Countergambit and for being the first player ever to be described as a Grandmaster of the game.Hooper & Whylde 1992. Oxford Companion to Chess. 2nd ed, p224–5, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-866164-9 == Life and works == Born in Birmingham, William Lewis moved to London where he worked for a merchant. He became a student of chess player Jacob Sarratt. In later years he showed himself to be very unkind to his old teacher. He said Sarratt's Treatise on the Game of Chess (1808)J. H. Sarratt, A treatise on the game of chess containing a regular system of attack and defence (1808) was a \"poorly written book\". But in 1822 three years after Sarrat died, Lewis published a second edition of it. This was in competition with a much better revision by Sarrat published in 1821 by Sarratt's poverty-stricken widow. In 1843, many players gave money to help the old widow, but Lewis' name is not on the list. Around 1819 Lewis was the hidden player inside the Turk, a fake chess playing machine. He told Johann Maelzel that Peter Unger Williams, also a student of Sarratt, should be the next person to operate inside the machine. Maezel took his advice and Williams replaced Lewis.B. Ewart Chess, man vs. machine (1980) page 84. Lewis began writing books including translations of the works of Greco and Carrera, published in 1819Gioachino Greco on the game of chess, translated by William Lewis (1819) and 1822.P.

Potter vol. 1 (1875) page 83. When De La Bourdonnais visited England in 1825, Lewis played about 70 games with the French master.F. M. Edge, The exploits and triumphs, in Europe, of Paul Morphy (1859) page 38. Lewis was known as a famous chess player in his time. The weekly magazine Bell's Life in 1838 called him \"our past grandmaster\", the first known use of the term in chess. In 1825 he began a chess club where he taught people to play the game. He wrote two books on how to play chess, the Series of Progressive Lessons (1831) and Second Series of Progressive Lessons (1832). Lewis's books, and those of his teacher Sarratt, were based on reworking François-André Danican Philidor's ideas to those of the ModeneseFrom Modena, on the River Po in Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. school of Del Rio, Lolli and Ponziani.The British chess magazine, vol. 26 (1906) page 189. Lewis gradually stopped playing competition chess. After his retirement he wrote other chess books, but he was no longer up to date with new ideas. The Oxford Chess Companion said his last book, A Treatise on Chess (1844),W. Lewis, A Treatise on the Game of Chess: containing an introduction to the game, and an analysis of the various opening of the game with several new modes of attack and defence (1844) was already \"out of date when published\". == References and notes == == Other websites == * Some of the games of Lewis can be found at chessgames.com Category:1787 births Category:1870 deaths Category:British chess players Category:Sportspeople from Birmingham",
