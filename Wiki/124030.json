 "text": "The 2008 South Ossetia war was a military conflict that started on 8 August 2008, between Georgia, South Ossetian (and Abkhazian) secessionists and Russia. South Ossetia and Abkhazia are territories within Georgia that declared independence from Georgia and have been acting in a de facto independent capacity since the early 1990s. Neither state has been diplomatically recognised by any member of the United Nations. The conflict began on August 8, 2008, after Georgia claimed South Ossetian separatists had broken a ceasefire by attacking villages, although South Ossetian officials deny that they attacked villages. Georgia launched a military offensive to surround and capture the capital of South Ossetia, Tskhinvali. Russian military troops entered the war at the side of South Ossetia and won the conflict. Georgia launched the Georgia versus Russia (Hague court application, 2008) in the International Court of Justice. The war ended on Saturday August 16th, 2008. == References == == Other websites == * Official information from Georgia's government President of the Republic of Poland * State Committee of Information and Press of the Republic of South Ossetia === Map resources === * Topographic maps of the region from Poyehali === Videos === * BBC World News Youtube Channel * Russia Today Youtube Channel * A journey to South Ossetia 2007 documentary about life in South Ossetia * Russian convoy moving towards Tskhinvali, 06:20 * Destruction in Tskhinvali, 01:36 * Casualties in Tskhinvali, 05:17 * Damaged hospital building in Tskhinvali, 02:17 Category:2008 in Europe Category:2000s in Russia Category:Abkhazia Category:2000s in Georgia (country) Category:South Ossetia Category:Wars involving Russia Category:2008 in Asia Category:August 2008 events Category:Caucasus Category:Wars involving Asia Category:Wars involving Europe Category:Wars of independence Category:2000s conflicts",
