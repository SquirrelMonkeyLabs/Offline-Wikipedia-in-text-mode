 "text": "Reggaeton is a form of urban music that first became popular with Latin American youths in the early 1990s. Reggaeton's predecessor originated in Panama as Reggae en Espa√±ol. After the music's gradual exposure in Puerto Rico, it eventually evolved into reggaeton. It blends British West reggae and dancehall with Latin American genres, as well as hip hop. Modern reggaeton beats follow the structure of the Dem Bow Riddim, a beat created by Jamaican producers Steely & Clevie in the late 80s and early 90s. However, over the years, it has been losing every noticeable similarity with its original reggae origins. ==Other websites== * Reggaeton Encyclopedia: History, instructional videos, shows, articles, performers (English & Russian) Category:Reggae music",
