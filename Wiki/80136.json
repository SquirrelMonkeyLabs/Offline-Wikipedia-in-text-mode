Retrieved 2024-01-07 The county is named after Akershus Fortress. == Geography == Most of the county is in the districts Follo and Romerike. There are also the two smaller districts of Asker and Bærum which are west of Oslo. Akershus includes some of the lake Mjøsa and some of the river Glomma. Because it includes many suburbs of Oslo, notably Bærum, Akershus has a large number of people living in a small area. The main national railway lines into Oslo run through Akershus with many stations such as Asker, Ullensaker, Ski and Lillestrøm. The county includes the historical place Eidsvoll, 48 km north of Oslo. This is where the National assembly voted the Norwegian constitution in 1814. South of Eidsvoll is the international airport of Oslo Airport at Gardermoen. The home of the crown prince is in Asker. == Buildings == The county has a major international airport, the Oslo Airport. It also has two university hospitals, Akershus University Hospital and Sunnaas Hospital. == History == Akershus became a fief in the 16th century. At that time it included the current counties of Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud and Oslo. It also included municipalities of Askim, Eidsberg and Trøgstad in the county of Østfold. In 1685 Buskerud was separated from Akershus. In 1768 Hedmark and Oppland were also separated from Akershus. In 1842 Christiania (Oslo) was made separate as well. In 1948 Aker was transferred to the county of Oslo. On 1 January 2020 the county merged with Buskerud and Østfold to the current county of Viken. == Origin == The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The fortress was built in 1299. Its name means \"the (fortified) house of (the district) Aker\". == Municipalities == # Asker # Aurskog-Høland # Bærum # Eidsvoll # Enebakk # Fet # Frogn # Gjerdrum # Hurdal # Lørenskog # Nannestad # Nes # Nesodden # Nittedal # Oppegård # Rælingen # Skedsmo # Ski # Sørum # Ullensaker # Vestby # Ås == References == == Other websites == * Akershus county website",
