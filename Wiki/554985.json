During the Carnation Revolution, Marcelo Caetano would only surrender to Spínola. This gave Spínola an important place after the revolution. He was made president of the National Salvation Junta. Then he became President of Portugal. He was only President 4 months before Francisco da Costa Gomes took the position. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Portuguese generals Category:Presidents of Portugal Category:Portuguese Roman Catholics",
