Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, she debuted as \"the Cat\" in Batman #1 (spring 1940). She is sometimes a villain or Batman's assistant in fighting crime. She is sometimes called \"Batman's girlfriend\" because of her love-hate with Batman. Catwoman wears leather clothing and has a whip. In some comics, her father was mobster Carmine Falcone. Bob Kane's inspiration for Catwoman was included Jean Harlow, Hedy Lamarr, and his cousin, Ruth Steele. == Fictional character biography == Selina Kyle is often portrayed as a thief and cat burglar with divided loyalties. Her criminal activities are often tempered by a reluctant altruism, making her an inconstant villain and occasional ally to Batman. She regularly eludes capture by the Dark Knight and maintains a complicated relationship which frequently fluctuates between flirtatious to romantic. == Powers and abilities == She is a dangerous, clever and resourceful fighter, known for precise, agile attacks and speedy getaways. Her formidable hand-to-hand combat skills are augmented by her cat-like speed, agility, reflexes, balance, and flexibility. == In other media == Catwoman has been adapted in various media incarnations. She is played by Lee Meriwether in Batman (1966), Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt in Batman, Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns (1992), Halle Berry in Catwoman (2004), Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Camren Bicondova in Gotham (2014-2019) and by ZoÃ« Kravitz in The Batman (2022). ==References== Category:Batman characters Category:DC Comics adapted into movies Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1940",
