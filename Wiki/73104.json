 "text": "Venture capital is a type of private equity capital. Typically it is provided by outside investors to new businesses that promise to grow fast, such as start-ups companies. Venture capital investments are usually high risk, but offer the potential for higher returns than other investments. A venture capitalist (VC) is a person who makes such investments. A venture capital fund is a pooled investment vehicle (often a limited partnership) that primarily invests the financial capital of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans. Venture capital can also include managerial and technical expertise. Most venture capital comes from a group of rich investors, investment banks and other financial institutions that pool such investments or partnerships. This form of raising capital is popular among new companies, or ventures. Venture Capital firms can go public after they have reached a certain stage of growth. Given that Venture Capital firms are financial investors in portfolio companies, they are expected to add value. == Other websites == * *National Venture Capital Association *Venture Capital Glossary *Ricafe2 - A Research programme sponsored by the European Commission analysing venture capital. *Venture Capital News & Blog: == References == Category:Capitalism",
