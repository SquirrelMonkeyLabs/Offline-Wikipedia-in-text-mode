It has 275 stores in Hesse, Thuringia, Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony- Anhalt, Lower Saxony and Baden-Württemberg. In early January 2013, it was bought by Migros. ==History== ===1940s=== The company was founded in 1947 by Theo Gutberlet under the name Thegu, derived from the first letters of his first and surname. It was later renamed in 1955 to Tegut. From 1961, the bigger supermarkets were called HaWeGe. ===1970=== In 1972, Tegut set up a subsidiary called kff Kurhessische Fleischwaren GmbH, which still produces Tegut's meat products. From 1973, the smaller stores were called Okay! ===1980s=== In 1989, the company was transferred to a foundation which appoints the managing directors. ===1990s=== In 1997, Tegut was the first grocer in Germany to accept credit card payments. In 1998, the company changed its name again to Tegut. It founded the Herzberger Bakery in 1996 as a subsidiary. With the Lädchen für alles (small shop for everything) concept, Tegut took up the idea of the corner shop in 2010. They set up smaller shops in the countryside and urban district to provide local supplies in smaller communities. ===2020s=== In 2024, it had about 300 traditional supermarkets and 40 fully automated mini-shops. In the automated shops people serve themselves. They have milk, butter, fresh fruit and vegetables. They also have condoms and pregnancy tests. The company says that they should be allowed to open on Sundays as nobody works there on Sundays. The German constitution says that most shops must shut on Sundays. ==References== Category:Hesse Category:Supermarkets of Germany Category:1947 establishments in Europe Category:1940s establishments in Germany",
