People who support this view are called anti-Stratfordians. (Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon- Avon, England.) They say \"Shakespeare of Stratford\" was a fake name to hide the identity of the real author or authors, who did not want their real names to become public.: 'Anti-Stratfordian' is the collective name for the belief that someone other than the man from Stratford wrote the plays commonly attributed to him.\"; . Shakespeare's authorship was first questioned in the middle of the 19th century. ; ; ; ; . At that time, there was a widespread view that Shakespeare was the greatest writer of all time.: By 1840, admiration for Shakespeare throughout Europe had become such that Thomas Carlyle \"could say without hyperbole\" that \"Shakespeare is the chief of all Poets hitherto; the greatest intellect who, in our recorded world, has left record of himself in the way of literature.\" Many books have been written about this controversy. 80 different candidates for Shakespeare's authorship have been proposed.. The most-studied candidates are Francis Bacon, the 6th Earl of Derby, Christopher Marlowe, and the 17th Earl of Oxford.; . Although this idea has attracted much public interest,. all but a few: \"Nevertheless, the skeptics who question Shakespeare’s authorship are relatively few in number, and they do not speak for the majority of academic and literary professionals.\" Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a conspiracy theory.; : \"The idea that William Shakespeare's authorship of his plays and poems is a matter of conjecture and the idea that the 'authorship controversy' be taught in the classroom are the exact equivalent of current arguments that 'intelligent design' be taught alongside evolution. In both cases an overwhelming scholarly consensus, based on a serious assessment of hard evidence, is challenged by passionately held fantasies whose adherents demand equal time.\"; . Most scholars only mention the theory if they are criticizing it. For example, James Shapiro has written several books criticizing this theory.: \"...antiStratfordism has remained a fringe belief system\"; ; : \"To ask me about the authorship question ... is like asking a palaeontologist to debate a creationist's account of the fossil record.\"; : \"I do not know of a single professor of the 1,300-member Shakespeare Association of America who questions the identity of Shakespeare ... antagonism to the authorship debate from within the profession is so great that it would be as difficult for a professed Oxfordian to be hired in the first place, much less gain tenure...\"; : \"I have never met anyone in an academic position like mine, in the Establishment, who entertained the slightest doubt as to Shakespeare's authorship of the general body of plays attributed to him.\"; : \"Shakespeareans sometimes take the position that to even engage the Oxfordian hypothesis is to give it a countenance it does not warrant.\"; : \"There is, it should be noted, no academic Shakespearian of any standing who goes along with the Oxfordian theory.\"; : \"...most of the great Shakespearean scholars are to be found in the Stratfordian camp...\" == Arguments == According to some Anti- Stratfordians, the works attributed to Shakespeare show education, aristocratic sensibility, and familiarity with the royal court that Shakespeare did not have.: \"These two notions—that the Shakespeare canon represented the highest achievement of human culture, while William Shakespeare was a completely uneducated rustic—combined to persuade Delia Bacon and her successors that the Folio's title page and preliminaries could only be part of a fabulously elaborate charade orchestrated by some more elevated personage, and they accordingly misread the distinctive literary traces of Shakespeare's solid Elizabethan grammar-school education visible throughout the volume as evidence that the 'real' author had attended Oxford or Cambridge.\" Shakespeare had a simple background, and the known details of his life seem incompatible with his poetic eminence and his reputation for genius, according to anti-Stratfordians.. In response, mainstream Shakespeare scholars have argued that determining authorship based on biographical information is unreliable.: \"Their [Oxfordians'] favorite code is the hidden personal allusion ... But this method is in essence no different from the cryptogram, since Shakespeare's range of characters and plots, both familial and political, is so vast that it would be possible to find in the plays 'self-portraits' of, once more, anybody one cares to think of.\"; : \"It has more than once been claimed that the combination of 'biographical-fit' and cryptographical arguments could be used to establish a case for almost any individual ... The very fact that their application has produced so many rival claimants demonstrates their unreliability.\" ; : \"in voicing dissatisfaction over the apparent lack of continuity between the certain facts of Shakespeare's life and the spirit of his literary output, anti-Stratfordians adopt the very Modernist assumption that an author's work must reflect his or her life. Neither Shakespeare nor his fellow Elizabethan writers operated under this assumption.\"; : \"...deriving an idea of an author from his or her works is always problematic, particularly in a multi-vocal genre like drama, since it crucially underestimates the heterogeneous influences and imaginative reaches of creative writing.\" They say there is extensive documentary evidence showing that Shakespeare authored his works. This evidence includes title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records.: \"The reasons we have for believing that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon wrote the plays and poems are the same as the reasons we have for believing any other historical event ... the historical evidence says that William Shakespeare wrote the plays and poems.\"; ; : \"Apart from the First Folio, the documentary evidence for William Shakespeare is the same as we get for other writers of the period...\" No direct evidence like this exists for any other candidate.: \"The problem that confronts all such attempts is that they have to dispose of the many testimonies from Will the player's own time that he was regarded as the author of the plays and the absence of any clear contravening public claims of the same nature for any of the other favoured candidates.\"; . Shakespeare's authorship was never questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death.: \"No one in Shakespeare's lifetime or the first two hundred years after his death expressed the slightest doubt about his authorship.\"; : \"...no suspicions regarding Shakespeare's authorship (except for a few mainly humorous comments) were expressed until the middle of the nineteenth century\". Anti-Stratfordians work for acknowledgment of the authorship question as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry and for acceptance of one or another of the various authorship candidates.; . ==References== Category:William Shakespeare Category:Controversies",
