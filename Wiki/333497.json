 "text": "This is a list of counties in Connecticut. There are eight counties in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Four of them were formed in 1666, when the colony of Connecticut was made from a number of smaller colonies. Two counties were made during colonial times, and two counties, Middlesex and Tolland, were formed after American independence (both in 1785). Six of the counties are named for locations in England, where many early Connecticut settlers were from. Although Connecticut is comprised of counties, after their abolishment in 1960, the roles of local government have been performed individually by Connecticut's 169 cities and towns.An Overview of County Government , National Association of Counties website, accessed 5 January 2008 ==Alphabetical listing== |} ==Former counties== *Trumbull County, Ohio - The Connecticut Western Reserve, given to Ohio in 1800. *Westmoreland County, Connecticut - An area around Wilkes-Barre, given to Pennsylvania in 1784. ==References== * Connecticut",
