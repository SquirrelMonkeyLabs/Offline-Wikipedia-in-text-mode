 "text": "I-dle (; stylized in lowercase), known in the past as (G)I-dle (), is a South Korean girl group active since 2 May 2018. The group is made of five members: Miyeon, Minnie, Soyeon, Yuqi and Shuhua. Soojin was the sixth member, but she was forced to leave the group by their company on 14 August 2021; she is a soloist now. I-dle makes K-pop music under , J-pop under U-Cube and pop under Republic Records and . Most of their songs are produced by the group members themselves. == Name == The group name was \"(G)I-dle\", but it is \"I-dle\" since May 2025. \"(G)I-dle\" () was Soyeon's idea. The original name was \"Idle\" (; ), the Korean word for \"children\". Some English-speaking fans did not like the name, because in English \"Idle\" means someone that is not working or that is lazy. For that reason, the name was changed to \"(G)I-dle\": * \"(G)\" as in \"Girl\", in brackets because it is silent; * \"I\" as in \"Individuality\"; * the hyphen \"-\" to show that the original name is now divided; * \"dle\" (; ), is used to make a word plural in Korean (just like the English \"s\"), because the group is made of six women grouped together, but with different and individual personalities. The right way to say the name when speaking is \"I-dle\", which sounds like \"\". Since May 2025, their name is also written \"I-dle\". Their fans are called \"Neverland\". == Members == Current members * Miyeon () – vocalist * Minnie () – vocalist * Soyeon () – leader, rapper * Yuqi () – vocalist, dancer * Shuhua () – vocalist Past members * Soojin () – dancer, vocalist, rapper == Discography == === Albums === * I Never Die (2022) * 2 (2024) === Extended plays === Korean EPs * I Am (2018) * I Made (2019) * I Trust (2020) * I Burn (2021) * I Love (2022) * I Feel (2023) * I Sway (2024) * We Are I-dle (2025) Japanese EPs * Latata (2019) * Oh My God (2020) English EPs * Heat (2023) === Single albums === * Dumdi Dumdi (2020) === Soundtrack appearances === * Run!
