It was active between 1996 and 2001. It was based in the city of Taloqan, Afghanistan. In 2001, it was reported that a leader of the movement was killed by Taliban fighters. The group was dissolved in 2001 following the September 11 attacks with the United States invading the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in the War in Afghanistan. ==References== Category:1996 establishments in Asia Category:2001 disestablishments Category:History of Afghanistan Category:Military alliances",
