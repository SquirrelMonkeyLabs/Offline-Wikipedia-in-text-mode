 "text": "A congressional caucus is a group of members of the United States Congress. They meet to try to make common legislative goals. Caucuses are created as congressional member organizations (CMOs) through the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. They are governed under the rules of these chambers. They are sometimes called conferences (especially Republican ones), coalitions, study groups, task forces, or working groups. Many other countries use the term parliamentary group. For example, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has many all-party parliamentary groups. ==References== Category:Legislative branch of the United States government",
