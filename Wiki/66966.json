 "text": "Stand-up comedy is a style of comedy where the comedian speaks directly to the audience. A person who performs stand-up comedy is known as a stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply stand-up. It is usually done by a single comedian, and with the help of a microphone. The comedian normally speaks quickly many funny stories and short jokes (called bits). This is called a monologue, routine or act. Some stand-up comedians use music, props, or magic tricks in their acts. Stand-up comedy is usually done in comedy clubs, bars, colleges, and theaters. However, there is no restriction on where it can be done. Many smaller clubs, bars, and restaurants do \"open microphone\" events where amateur comedians can perform comedy in front of a live audience, offering a way for the performers to become better and possibly become professional comedians. ==Related pages== * List of stand-up comedians * Rakugo – Japanese verbal entertainment * Manzai – style of stand-up comedy in Japan * Open mike – live show where audience members may perform at the microphone Category:Comedy Category:Theatrical forms",
