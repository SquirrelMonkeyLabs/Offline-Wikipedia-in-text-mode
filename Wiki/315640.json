 "text": "Michael Steven Bublé (born September 9, 1975) is a Canadian-Italian singer, songwriter and actor. He has won four Grammy Awards and multiple Juno Awards. His first album reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and in Canada. His 2005 album, It's Time, and his 2007 album, Call Me Irresponsible, were very successful around the world, reaching number one on the Canadian album chart, the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, and the European charts. Bublé has sold over 75 million albums worldwide. ==Early life== Bublé was born in Burnaby, British Columbia in September 1975. His father is Lewis Bublé, a salmon fisherman. His mother is Amber (née Santagà). From his earliest years, Bublé wanted to be a singer. He took an interest in jazz about the age of five. As a boy, he had a great interest in hockey. He shared his interest with his father and grandfather. He played hockey but realized he was not good enough to be a professional player. At the age of 14, he began working with his father on a fishing boat. Sometimes they would be away from home two or three months at a time. Bublé credits the hard work on the boat with making him a man. At age 16, Bublé began singing in nightclubs. His original stage name was \"Mickey Bubbles\". He credits his Italian maternal grandfather with these opportunities. His grandfather traded his ability as a plumber for the chance to have his grandson appear on stage. == Personal life == Bublé became an Italian citizen in 2005. He has been married to Argentine actress Luisana Lopilato since 2011. They have three children (two sons and a daughter). In 2016, his eldest son, Noah, was diagnosed with cancer but was in remission two years later. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Michael Bublé (2003) * It's Time (2005) * Call Me Irresponsible (2007) * Crazy Love (2009) * Christmas (2011) * To Be Loved (2013) *❤ (2018) * Higher (2022) ;Independent albums * First Dance (1996) * Babalu (2001) * Dream (2002) ;Live albums * Come Fly with Me (2004) * Caught in the Act (2005) * Michael Bublé Meets Madison Square Garden (2009) ==Tours== * Michael Bublé: Live in Concert (2004) * It's Time Tour (2005–06) * Irresponsible Tour (2007–08) * Crazy Love Tour (2010–12) To be loved Tour 2013-15 Evening with Michael Bublé in 2019-2022 Higher Tour ==Filmography== * 2000: Duets * 2001: Totally Blonde * 2003: The Snow Walker * 2004: Las Vegas – Catch of the Day ==Awards and nominations== Year Award Category Result 2001 Genie Best Achievement in Music – Original Song – \"I've Never Been in Love Before\" Nom. 2001 Genie Best Achievement in Music – Original Song – \"Dumb ol' Heart\" Nom. 2004 Juno Best New Artist Won 2004 Juno Album of the Year – Michael Bublé Nom. 2005 World Music Award World's Best Selling Artist/Canada Won 2005 World Music Award World's Best Selling Male Pop Artist Nom. 2006 Juno Pop Album of the Year – It's Time Won 2006 Juno Single of the Year – \"Home\" Won 2006 Juno Album of the Year – It's Time Won 2006 Juno Artist of the Year Won 2006 Juno Juno Fan Choice Award Nom. 2006 ECHO Jazz Production of the Year – It's Time Won 2006 ECHO International Newcomer of the Year – It's Time Nom. 2006 Grammy Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album – It's Time Nom. 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards MuchMoreMusic Award – \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" Won 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards MuchMoreMusic Award – \"Home\" Nom 2006 American Music Awards Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist Nom. 2007 National Jazz Awards Male Vocalist of the Year Won 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards MuchMoreMusic Award – \"Everything\" Won 2007 Gemini Best Performance or Host in a Variety Program or Series – \"How About You?\" (with Lou Pomanti) Nom. 2007 Grammy Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album – Caught in the Act Nom. 2007 People's Choice Awards Favorite Remake – \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" Nom. 2007 Juno Juno Fan Choice Award Nom. 2008 ECHO International Pop/Rock Male Artist of the Year – Call Me Irresponsible Nom. 2008 BRIT Awards International Male Solo Artist Nom. 2008 Grammy Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album – Call Me Irresponsible Won 2008 Grammy Best Male Pop Vocal Performance – \"Everything\" Nom. 2008 Juno Artist of the Year Nom. 2008 Juno Album of the Year – Call Me Irresponsible Nom. 2008 Juno Pop Album of the Year – Call Me Irresponsible Nom. 2008 Juno Single of the Year – \"Everything\" Nom. 2008 Juno Juno Fan Choice Award Won 2008 Canadian Smooth Jazz Awards Best Male Vocalist Won 2008 Canadian Smooth Jazz Awards Best Original Composition – \"Everything\" Won 2009 Juno Single of the Year – \"Lost\" Nom. 2010 Grammy Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album – Michael Bublé Meets Madison Square Garden Won 2010 BRIT Awards International Male Solo Artist Nom. 2010 Meteor Awards International Male Solo Artist Won 2010 Juno Pop Album of the Year – Crazy Love Won 2010 Juno Single of the Year – \"Haven't Met You Yet\" Won 2010 Juno Album of the Year – Crazy Love Won 2010 Juno Juno Fan Choice Award Won 2010 Juno Artist of the Year Nom 2010 Juno Songwriter of the Year Nom 2010 American Music Awards Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist Won 2011 Grammy Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album - Crazy Love Won 2011 Grammy Best Male Pop Vocal Performance - \"Haven't Met You Yet\" Nom 2011 Juno Juno Fan Choice Award Nom == Other websites == * Official Michael Bublé site * ==References== Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian pop musicians Category:Canadian singers Category:Canadian jazz musicians Category:Jazz singers Category:Musicians from British Columbia Category:People from Burnaby",
