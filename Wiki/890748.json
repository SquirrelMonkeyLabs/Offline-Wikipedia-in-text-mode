 "text": "The Icelandic Commonwealth was a state in Iceland that existed from 930 till 1262. Before this, the island was uninhabited until 874, except probably Irish Hermit Monks. In 1262 the Commonwealth pledged allegiance to The Kingdom of Norway. == Notable People == Leif Erikson came from the Icelandic Commonwealth == Government == The Icelandic Commonwealth existed without a state. Iceland's mountainous geography isolated settlements and gave local families and farmer's control. Because violence was being used by settlements to solve problems in 930 a yearly general assembly called the Alþingi was created at Law Rock. along with this there were local assemblies called þingi. The Alþingi made laws and solved problems. However it made it's decisions by who had more force and not who was right. Chieftains would dress nicely and show their weapons and wealth in meetings to get what they wanted. There was no state so people most of the time chieftains did the decisions themselves. Chieftains were called Goðar in iceland and had less power than in Norway. They made security contracts with free farmers. They had their power from their contracts, wealth, weapon and dress. Chieftains collected grain from their followers. While there was gifts and feasting between chieftains there was also raiding and war. A chieftains followers were to go on these raids. By 1200 however Icelandic chieftains had real authority and free farmers were now wage workers. Chieftains raised their own army's for the first time. Chieftains who did not grow their power and army could no longer be chieftains. == History == Most of the what is known about Icelandic commonwealth history comes for the Icelandic \"sagas\". The discovery of Iceland was in the 860's by a man called Naddodd. Before it was probably inhabited by Irish monks called \"papar\" who left to get away from the \"heathens\". In about 871 Ingolf Arnason and his followers founded Reykjavík it's namesake coming from the hot springs present there. In the beginning of the Egil saga a man called Skallagrim along with his father fled from King Harald who had ordered his fathers execution for disloyalty. Later in the sagas Iceland is described to one of the main characters as a land \"free of kings and criminals\". Settlers would engage in \"Viking\" where they raided Europe for slaves. But slaves died more than wage (paid) workers so never were as widespread. In 1192. The settlers came with local assemblies called þingi. In 930 the Alþingi was established. In the twentieth century icelandic wool lost value. Because of this there was famine in 1192. By 1200 The Age of Sturlungs had started. War happened often and armies grew. Chieftains had become powerful and farmers were their subjects. Large price controls by the Alþingi in the 1200's had stopped trade with Norway. Because of this there was a famine in 1192. In 1262 Gizur Porvaldsson got the Icelandic chieftains to agree to cede their authority to the king of Norway and the Commonwealth ended. == References == Category:History of Iceland Category:930s establishments Category:Former countries in Europe",
