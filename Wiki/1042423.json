 "text": "The variable bush frog (Raorchestes akroparallagi) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains between 180 and 1425 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in many different kinds of places: evergreen forests, forests that have been cut down and grown back, teak farms, and plants near roads. The frogs sit on plants 1 to 2 meters above the ground. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, this frog hatches from its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that human beings have changed. One of the places this frog lives, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, is a protected park. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
