 "text": "Crewe railway works is a British railway engineering facility built in 1840 by the Grand Junction Railway. It is located in the town of Crewe, in Cheshire. It is currently owned by Bombardier Transportation. At its height, Crewe Works employed over 20,000 people. In 2005 fewer than 1,000 remained on site, with a further 270 redundancies announced in November 2005. More cutbacks, or even closure, are possible. Current work is largely focused on general maintenance and the inspection of seriously damaged rolling stock. Much of the site once occupied by the works has been sold off and is now occupied by a supermarket, leisure park, and a large new health centre.
