It is used in France.Ethnologue - LSF There are approximately 3,506,800 people living in France who are deaf.Deaf population on France LSF differs from American Sign Language (ASL) although there are many common signs. == History == Sign languages have existed in many places in the past.Marc Marschark; Patricia Elizabeth Spencer, The Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education, Volume 1 (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 331 They came about naturally with deaf people and their relatives. But sign languages have existed among hearing peoples also. They were used by hunters to silently communicate around game animals. Native American peoples had a sign language that could be understood by Native Americans speaking as many as 40 different languages. Christian monks used sign language while living under code of silence. Factory workers and others in extremely noisy places use sign languages. Charles-Michel de l'Épée is considered the father of sign language. In 1771 he started the first free school for the deaf in Paris. He took in deaf students from many different places. Some came from Martha's Vineyard in the United States. There was a good deal of hereditary deafness there and the residents adopted their own sign language. Many came who used a local sign language. L'Épée combined all these into a standard sign language. His sign language eventually developed into the French Sign Language and is widely used all over Europe. ==References== Category:Sign languages Category:French language",
