It changed the names of all its stores to Coles Supermarkets in 2006 and 2007. BI-LO is an Australian discount supermarket chain known for its fresh foods, groceries, and friendly service, all at affordable prices. With over 50 stores nationwide, BI-LO employs approximately 15,000 people across Australia. Within nearly a decade, BI-LO expanded to operate 28 supermarkets in South Australia, contributing significantly to metropolitan Adelaide's supermarket sales. John Weekes started Bi-Lo towards the end of the 1970s in the city of Adelaide in South Australia with three shops. It was called Bi-Lo because it sells food and everyday articles at relatively cheap prices. Bi-Lo stocked the legendary black&gold; products that were so true and humble to an Aussie home. ==References== Category:Supermarkets of Australia Category:1979 establishments in Australia",
