 "text": "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir presumptive to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and of his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, happened on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo. Both of them were shot and killed by Gavrilo Princip. Princip was one of a group of seven assassins (five from Serbia and one from Bosnia) from the Black Hand. The political reason for the secret society to commit assassination was to make Austria-Hungary's South Slavic provinces and then combine them into a new country, Greater Serbia. That led to the outbreak of war in Europe in late July 1914, which started when Austria-Hungary invaded Serbia. Both countries had allies that fought in World War I. == References == == Other websites == * Map of Europe at the time of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand at omniatlas.com * Newsreels about Franz Ferdinand's assassination at www.europeanfilmgateway.eu * Prison Interview with Gavrilo Princip after the Assassination Category:1914 in Europe Category:Assassinations in Europe Category:Murders by firearm Category:Sarajevo Category:World War I",
