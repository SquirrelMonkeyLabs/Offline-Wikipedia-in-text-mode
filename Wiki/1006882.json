 "text": "Tagata Shrine is a small shrine located in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It a Shikinaisha and was previously designated as Go-sha. Tagata Shrine is famous for its Harvest Festival Hōnensai held annually in March. The old character form of 'ken' is written as '碣' (agata, ken), and sometimes used to represent Tagata Shrine. It is near Ōagata jinja which has a similar yonic festival the day before == Enshrined deities == The deities enshrined here are Toshigami and Tamahime no Mikoto, gods of bountiful harvests and prosperity of descendants. According to the shrine's legend, this area was part of the residence of Oarata no Mikoto, and the goddess of a bountiful harvest was enshrined in the residence. Tamahime no Mikoto was the daughter of Oarata no Mikoto, and after her husband died, she returned to her parents' home and raised her children splendidly as a mother while helping her father to develop the area. It is said that Within the grounds of Tagata Shrine, there are several stones that have been carved into the shape of phalluses. == History == The exact year of foundation for Tagata Shrine is unknown, but it is considered to be a fairly old shrine with roots in indigenous beliefs. It is known for combining beliefs related to fertility and agriculture. In historical records such as Engishiki Jinmyocho, it is identified as 'Tagata- jinja Shrine, Niwa-gun, Owari Province', and in 'Owari National Shrine' in 1364 as 'Junior Third Rank Uedakata Tenjin'. The shrine was later relocated to its current location in the former Kasugai County. == Harvest festival == The harvest festival, known as 'Hounensai' or 'Hounen Matsuri', is held on March 15th every year at Tagata Shrine. It is also commonly referred to as the 'Henoko Festival'. During this festival, men carry a mikoshi (portable shrine) in the shape of a phallus called Oowasegata, while mikos carry smaller phallic-shaped portable shrines. According to legend, touching the mikoshi is believed to bring fertility and the blessing of having a child. The giant stem of the mikoshi is approximately 60 centimeters in diameter and over 2 meters long, making it a significant and prominent feature of the festival. During the Hōnensai or Hounen Matsuri festival, the phallus is symbolized as 'heaven' and the female yin as 'earth'. The festival serves as a prayer for abundant harvests of the five grains through the blessings of heaven and the moistening of the earth, as well as for blessings of children. The festival is held in spring, which also represents the birth of new life, further emphasizing the connection between fertility, agriculture, and the cycle of life in this indigenous belief system. In Inuyama City, there is another festival called Hounen Matsuri (or Ososo Matsuri) at Ōagata jinja. This festival includes floats shaped like a vulva, which complement the phallic-shaped mikoshi used in the festival. === Features === Souvenirs of phallic-shaped candies, chocolates, and objects are available for sale at the festival. In recent years, the festival has gained popularity among foreign tourists, and many visitors from abroad also come to experience it. During the Hounensai festival, multiple parking lots near the shrine are available for visitors to use. == Gallery == File:Tagata_Shrine_Festival_20090315_(田縣神社の豊年祭)_-_panoramio.jpg|alt=鳥居|torii File:Tagata_jinja_okumiya_2020-12_ac_(1).jpg|alt=奥宮|Okumiya File:Tagata_Shrine_4.JPG|alt=願掛け|wish File:Ensured_Phallus_object,_Tagata_Shrine_2.jpg|alt=珍宝窟|treasure cave File:Ensured_Phallus_object,_Tagata_Shrine_1.jpg|alt=神体|object of worship File:Phallus_stone_pole,_Tagata_Shrine.jpg|alt=石柱|stone pillar File:Phallus_cake,_Hōnen_Matsuri_(Tagata_Shrine)_2.jpg|alt=珍呆参|pastry File:Hōnen_Matsuri_2.JPG|alt=豊年祭|harvest festival File:Hōnen_Matsuri_6.JPG|alt=豊年祭|harvest festival == Access == * About 5 minutes on foot (about 200m) from Tagata Jinja-mae Station on the Meitetsu Komaki Line . ==Related pages== *Ōagata jinja (Ogata Shrine) == Related books == * Kinji Niwa (ed.), \"Niwa Bunko Ancient Documents and Calligraphic Catalogs Related to the Reconstruction of Dedicated Tagata Shrine (February 11, 1975)\" 1975 * Nakai Fumio (Author) \"Japan's No. 1 Cannabis Production: Taken Shrine Woodcraft, Saiki Kunimitsu's Writings,\" Iwao Kameyama, 1981 == Other websites == * * 田縣神社の豊年祭 小牧市 Category:Shinto Category:Min-sha Category:Shikinaisha Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Gō-sha Category:Aichi Prefecture",
