 "text": "The short-footed frog, savannah water-holding frog, blotched water-holding frog, or superb collared frog (Ranoidea brevipes) is a frog from northern Australia. It lives in Queensland. This frog is between 3.0 and 6.0 cm in length. Its feet are not always webbed. It has spots or stripes on its back. This frog lives in grasslands and forests where the trees are not too close together. When the weather is rainy, this frog looks for food. When the weather is dry, the frog digs a burrow and stays underground. The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
