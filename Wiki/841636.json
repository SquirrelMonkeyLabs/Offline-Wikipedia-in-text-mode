 "text": "The social stigma of obesity, also known as fatphobia, is a stigma that causes problems for overweight and obese people. A similar problem is weight stigma. These two stigmas mean bias and discrimination against people because of their body weight. Several studies across the world show that overweight or obese people have higher levels of stigma than thin people. Also, obese people marry less often. There are fewer jobs or educational opportunities for obese people. On average, obese people get lesser incomes than normal weight and underweight people. There are civil rights and anti-discrimination laws for obese people. However, these people still face discrimination and bias. Anti- fat bias, also called fat shaming, means prejudice toward obese people. The fat acceptance movement says anti-fat bias is found and seen all through society. Many health organization report that obesity is unhealthy and can make the person more likely to have medical problems. These problems include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, sleep apnea, some types of cancer and stroke. ==References== Category:Sociology Category:Obesity",
