 "text": "Iron pentacarbonyl is a chemical compound made of iron, copper, and oxygen. It is a coordination complex where five carbonyl ligands (CO) are connected to one iron atom (Fe). The chemical formula is . == Preparation == Iron pentacarbonyl is made by a chemical reaction between iron and carbon monoxide. == Uses == Heating iron pentacarbonyl breaks up the coordination complex, making very pure carbonyl iron. == Safety == Iron pentacarbonyl formation can erode pipes that contain syngas or other mixtures that have carbon monoxide. Iron pentacarbonyl is toxic, but not as dangerous as the related nickel tetracarbonyl. == Sources == Category:Iron compounds Category:Carbonyl complexes",
