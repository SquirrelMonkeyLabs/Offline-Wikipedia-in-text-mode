He is credited with a method to finance new construction or major additions of buildings through issue of debentures by municipal government. First employed in 2001 to fund the South Courtice Arena and Recreation Complex, it is seen as a cost- effective method to undertake large scale publicly funded projects. Mutton was part of the Canadian bid to become the site of the new International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in 2003. The project was not successful. However, Mutton remained a champion for Darlington Nuclear Generating Station to become the site of a new nuclear facility in Ontario. Mutton returned to municipal politics in 2010 in a bid for appointment of Durham Regional Chair. He would later lobby for and supported the campaign to reform the position from an appointment to one that is elected. A referendum was held in the 2010 election and 80% of voters were in favour of the reform. Durham Region Council passed By-law No. 19-2012 to change the selection method to election by general vote in 2012. Commencing in 2014, voters will elect the position. Durham Region was the second region in the Greater Toronto Area to adopt the reform. ==Achievements== • Established the Clarington Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. • Newsmaker of the Year, 2006, Durham Region Metroland Newspapers. • Received the Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee Medal from Her Majesty and the Government of Canada in 2013 for his years of service to Canada. ==Sports Achievements== * Won the 2017 IBJJF Superheavyweight Las Vegas Open Gold Medal. * Won the 2017 IBJJF Superheavyweight Miami Open Gold Medal. * Won the 2017 Rickson Gracie Superheavyweight Gold Medal in New York. * Won the 2017 IBJJF Superheavyweight World Bronze medal. * Won the 2018 IBJJF Superheavyweight Los Angeles Open Gold Medal. ==Electoral results== 1997 (1) Candidate Vote % John Mutton 2000 (3) Candidate Vote % John Mutton 8,717 44% Mary Novak 4,346 22% Bill Stockwell 3,173 16% Troy Young 3,490 18% 2003 (4) Candidate Vote % John Mutton 16,061 90% Richard Ward 1,824 10% 2006 (5) Candidate Vote % Jim Abernethy 11,204 50% John Mutton 5,968 27% Jim Schell 4,596 20% Richard Ward 495 2% Wayne Chaskavich 291 1% == References == Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian mayors Category:Politicians from Ontario",
