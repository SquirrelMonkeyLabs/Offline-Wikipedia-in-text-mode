 "text": "Françoise Madeleine Hardy (; 17 January 1944 – 11 June 2024) was a French singer-songwriter, model and actress. As a celebrity in many fields, she became a cultural icon in France. She was seen as a leading figure of the Yé- yé style of music. == Early life == Hardy was born on 17 January 1944 in Paris and grew up in a relatively poor family. From her childhood, she was so interested in literature that she was attracted to Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus. She received a guitar from her father as a present for her passing baccalaureat at 16. It caused her to get interested in chanson. Hardy mastered guitar by herself and showed an interest in composing chanson. Trying to be a singer was hard, she failed many times. After entering the University of Sorbonne in Paris, she kept studying a chanson in Petit conservatoire de la chanson, a chanson school founded by Mireille who was a famous singer at that time. Soon, she contracted with the record label Vogue in November 1961. == Success == In June 1962, she made a great debut with her famous chanson Tous les garçons et les filles which became a hit all over Europe at her age of 18. The song made the wave of Yé-yé music in France with two million sales. It was when another famous song Comment te dire adieu appeared that Hardy estalished her as a singer in 1968. The song received a favorable review from many critics who were indifferent to young singers without precedent. Since then, she has been a cultural iconic figure in France. All of almost her songs were self written, and they have been translated into English, Spanish, Italian and German. As an actress, she appeared in many movies such as Château en Suède (1963), Une balle au cœur (1965), What’s new pussycat? (1966) Masculin- Féminin (1966) and Grand prix (1967). ==Personal life== She had a son, Thomas Dutronc in 1973 and married his father Jacques Dutronc. They remained married but were separated. She also had a career in astrology and wrote books about it. Hardy died on 11 June 2024 of laryngeal cancer in Paris at the age of 80.Françoise Hardy, icône de la culture pop, est morte ==Some albums== ==References== ==Other websites== * * * * Françoise Hardy at Discogs * * Françoise Hardy at Last.fm * Françoise Hardy at the Official Charts Company * Françoise Hardy at Rate Your Music Category:Singers from Paris Category:French singer-songwriters Category:1944 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Musicians from Paris Category:Deaths from laryngeal cancer Category:Actors from Paris Category:French pop singers Category:French guitarists Category:French movie actors Category:Writers from Paris Category:French novelists Category:French activists Category:Models from Paris Category:Astrologers",
