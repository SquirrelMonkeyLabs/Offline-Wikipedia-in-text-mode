 "text": "Meishi Street, directed by Ou Ning, is a 2006 independent Chinese documentary that shows ordinary citizens taking a stand against the planned destruction of their homes for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In order to widen traffic routes for the Olympic Games, the Beijing Municipal Government orders the demolition of entire neighborhoods. Several evictees of Meishi Street, located next to Tiananmen Square, fight through endless red tape and the indifference of fellow citizens for the right to keep their homes. Given video cameras by the filmmakers, they shoot exclusive footage of the eviction process, adding vivid intimacy to their story. ==Awards== * Official Selection - Museum of Modern Art Documentary Fortnight * Official Selection - Istanbul Biennial ==Other websites== * Meishi Street for Home and Institutional Use Download * Meishi Street Trailer Category:2006 documentary movies Category:Chinese movies",
