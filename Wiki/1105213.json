 "text": "X-Men is an American superhero movie series based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. An X-Men movie produced by 20th Century Fox and directed by Bryan Singer was released in 2000. Singer returned for a sequel, X2, which was released in 2003. Due to him directing Superman Returns (2006), Singer was replaced by Brett Ratner for the third and final movie of the original X-Men trilogy, X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). The trilogy became a movie series with the release of X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), a prequel movie based on the character Wolverine. In 2011, a prequel and soft reboot of the series, titled X-Men: First Class was released. It focused on the younger versions of Charles Xavier / Professor X and Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, before they became enemies. In 2013, a second Wolverine movie, The Wolverine, was released, but it was set after The Last Stand. The prequel and the original series crossovered in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). In the new movie, a new timeline is created and it is the one that the rest of the movies follow. The first movie of the new timeline is Deadpool (2016), which is based on the character of the same name. X-Men: Apocalypse was released in the same year and was followed by the third and final Wolverine movie, Logan. Deadpool 2 was released in 2018 and the fourth and final movie of the X-Men prequel series, Dark Phoenix, was released in 2019. The final movie of the series, The New Mutants, was released in 2020. The X-Men movie series also has two television series, Legion (2017–2019) and The Gifted (2017–2019). Legion has three seasons and The Gifted has two. After The Walt Disney Company bought Fox in 2019, Marvel Studios took the rights to X-Men and the Fantastic Four. Having plans for their own X-Men movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), they canceled all planned X-Men projects. Patrick Stewart returned as a different version of Professor X in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) and Kelsey Grammer returned as a different version of Hank McCoy / Beast in The Marvels (2023). In Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), the third Deadpool movie, a lot of the characters from the movie series will return, even though it is part of the MCU. An X-Men movie set in the MCU is in development. The series has got positive reviews, with X-Men: Days of Future Past and Logan being considered two of the best superhero movies of all time. All 13 movies have made over $6 billion around the world. == Movies == Movies U.S. release date Director(s) Screenwriter(s) Story by Producer(s) X-Men original trilogy X-Men Bryan Singer David Hayter Tom DeSanto & Bryan Singer Lauren Shuler Donner & Ralph Winter X2 Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris & David Hayter Zak Penn, David Hayter & Bryan Singer X-Men: The Last Stand Brett Ratner Simon Kinberg & Zak Penn Lauren Shuler Donner, Ralph Winter & Avi Arad Wolverine trilogy X-Men Origins: Wolverine Gavin Hood David Benioff & Skip Woods Lauren Shuler Donner, Ralph Winter, Hugh Jackman & John Palermo The Wolverine James Mangold Mark Bomback & Scott Frank Lauren Shuler Donner & Hutch Parker Logan Scott Frank, James Mangold & Michael Green James Mangold Lauren Shuler Donner, Simon Kinberg & Hutch Parker X-Men prequel movies X-Men: First Class Matthew Vaughn Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman & Matthew Vaughn Sheldon Turner & Bryan Singer Lauren Shuler Donner, Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg & Gregory Goodman X-Men: Days of Future Past Bryan Singer Simon Kinberg Jane Goldman, Simon Kinberg & Matthew Vaughn Lauren Shuler Donner, Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg & Hutch Parker X-Men: Apocalypse Bryan Singer, Simon Kinberg, Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris Dark Phoenix Simon Kinberg Lauren Shuler Donner, Simon Kinberg, Hutch Parker & Todd Hallowell Deadpool movies Deadpool Tim Miller Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick Lauren Shuler Donner, Simon Kinberg & Ryan Reynolds Deadpool 2 David Leitch Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick & Ryan Reynolds Spin-off The New Mutants Josh Boone Josh Boone & Knate Lee Simon Kinberg, Karen Rosenfelt & Lauren Shuler Donner == Television series == Series Season Episodes Originally aired Showrunner First aired Last aired Network Legion 1 8 February 8, 2017 March 29, 2017 FX Noah Hawley 2 11 April 3, 2018 June 12, 2018 3 8 June 24, 2019 August 12, 2019 The Gifted 1 13 October 2, 2017 January 15, 2018 Fox Matt Nix 2 16 September 25, 2018 February 26, 2019 == Timeline == The events of the films are conventionally placed into two main \"timelines\". The \"original\" timeline begins with X-Men Origins: Wolverine (though multiple events in this film would be retconned or contradicted in others released afterward) and moving through First Class, the original trilogy and The Wolverine until the dystopian setting of Days of Future Past. Starting from that film's ending, a \"new\" timeline is created, with the proceeding prequel films Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix showing events differently than what was established before. The setting of Logan was initially implied by Hugh Jackman to be set in an alternate timeline and not following the prequel films, before director James Mangold stated that it was related; Marvel later officially classified the film as a separate universe from the film series in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z. Despite this, Deadpool & Wolverine treats Logan and the other Deadpool films as part of the X-Men film series timeline with most of the films existing within the same universe, designated again as Earth-10005.
