 "text": "The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU) was founded as a trade union to help organize the farmers in the Southern United States. It was started in the Great Depression to improve money problems and work conditions for farmers in the United States. At this time, landowners were being paid not to farm by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, but they were not all sharing the money with farmers. ==Sources== *Cobb, William H. \"The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union\".
