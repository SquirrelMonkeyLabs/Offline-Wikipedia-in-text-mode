 "text": "The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) is an American professional basketball league for women. It was made in April 22, 1996. The league first held games in June 1997. The WNBA has 13 teams, all in the United States, in its upcoming 2025 season. Two more teams, one each in the U.S. and Canada, will start play in 2026. The games have four 10-minute quarters. There is also a 24-second shot clock. Each team is allowed to have 12 players, and must have at least 11 on the roster. Due to a strict salary cap, many teams only carry 11 players on their rosters. The ball used for WNBA games is 1 inch (2.54 cm) smaller in circumference and 2.5 ounces (70 g) lighter than the ball used for all adult men's full-court basketball (including the National Basketball Association, the top professional basketball league for men in the United States). The WNBA ball is the same size used for all adult women's full-court play. The ball also has alternating white and orange panels, unlike the all- orange NBA ball. == Footnotes == == References == == Other websites == * WNBA official website Category:1997 establishments in the United States",
