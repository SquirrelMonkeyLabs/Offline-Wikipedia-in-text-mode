Scientists have only seen it in one place: Medog County in Xixang, but they think it might live in India too. People have seen this frog between 1200 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists saw this in rainforests in warm parts of the world. They found it on small, woody plants near a lake. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
