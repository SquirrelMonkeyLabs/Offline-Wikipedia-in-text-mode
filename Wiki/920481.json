 "text": "LGBT parenting is about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people raising one or more children as parents or foster care parents. This includes: children raised by same-sex couples, children raised by single LGBT parents, and children raised by an opposite-sex couple where at least one partner is LGBT. This has been controversial since some critics believe that children raised with LGBT parents might develop mental issues; however this is not scientifically proven. ==References== Category:LGBT",
