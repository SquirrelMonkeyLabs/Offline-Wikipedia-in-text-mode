 "text": "The 2018 Atlantic hurricane season was a near-normal season but above-average in terms of Accumulated Cyclone Energy. There were 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes in which tropical cyclones were formed in the Northern Hemisphere at the Atlantic basin. They caused a total of over $50 billion (2018 USD) in damages and at least 172 deaths. The hurricane season officially started on June 1, and officially ended on November 30. Subtropical Storm Alberto in late May was the first storm of the season that formed on May 25. This was the fourth consecutive season in which storms formed before the official start of the hurricane season. Beryl became the first hurricane of the season in early July. Florence became the first major hurricane of the season on September 5. Michael became the second major hurricane of the season on October 9, and a day later, it became the third-most intense hurricane to make landfall in the United States in terms of pressure, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille of 1969. As Michael became a Category 5, 2018 became a third consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane (Matthew in 2016; Irma and Maria in 2017). This season is the first on record to see seven storms that were subtropical at some point in their lifetimes (Alberto, Beryl, Debby, Ernesto, Joyce, Leslie, and Oscar). The season ended with Hurricane Oscar on October 31. ==Timeline== ImageSize = width:800 height:230 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/2018 till:30/11/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/2018 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_≤39_mph_(≤62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(118–153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111–129_mph_(178–208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130–156_mph_(209–251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_≥157_mph_(≥252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:25/05/2018 till:31/05/2018 color:TS text:\"Alberto (TS)\" from:04/07/2018 till:08/07/2018 color:C1 barset:break barset:skip from:14/07/2018 till:15/07/2018 color:TS text:\"Beryl (C1)\" from:06/07/2018 till:12/07/2018 color:C2 text:\"Chris (C2)\" from:07/08/2018 till:09/08/2018 color:TS text:\"Debby (TS)\" from:15/08/2018 till:17/08/2018 color:TS text:\"Ernesto (TS)\" from:31/08/2018 till:17/09/2018 color:C4 text:\"Florence (C4)\" from:03/09/2018 till:06/09/2018 color:TS text:\"Gordon (TS)\" from:07/09/2018 till:16/09/2018 color:C2 text:\"Helene (C2)\" from:07/09/2018 till:15/09/2018 color:C1 text:\"Isaac (C1)\" barset:break from:12/09/2018 till:18/09/2018 color:TS text:\"Joyce (TS)\" from:21/09/2018 till:22/09/2018 color:TD text:\"Eleven (TD)\" from:22/09/2018 till:24/09/2018 color:TS text: barset:break barset:skip barset:skip from:26/09/2018 till:28/09/2018 color:TS text:\"Kirk (TS)\" from:23/09/2018 till:25/09/2018 color:TS barset:break barset:skip barset:skip barset:skip from:28/09/2018 till:13/10/2018 color:C1 text:\"Leslie (C1)\" from:07/10/2018 till:11/10/2018 color:C5 text:\"Michael (C5)\" from:09/10/2018 till:12/10/2018 color:TS text:\"Nadine (TS)\" from:26/10/2018 till:31/10/2018 color:C2 text:\"Oscar (C2)\" barset:break barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/2018 till:31/05/2018 text:May from:01/06/2018 till:30/06/2018 text:June from:01/07/2018 till:31/07/2018 text:July from:01/08/2018 till:31/08/2018 text:August from:01/09/2018 till:30/09/2018 text:September from:01/10/2018 till:31/10/2018 text:October from:01/11/2018 till:30/11/2018 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\"(From the\" pos:(618,30) text:\"Saffir–Simpson scale)\" ==Storm names== The following list of names were to be used for naming storms that will be formed in the North Atlantic in 2018.
