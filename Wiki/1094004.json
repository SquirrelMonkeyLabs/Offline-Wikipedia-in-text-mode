 "text": "Blackpool South is a British constituency in Lancashire which is currently vacant. It was represented in the House of Commons from 2019 until 2024 by Scott Benton. He was elected as a Conservative. After he had the Conservative Party whip suspended in April 2023 he sat as an independent. Benton resigned in March 2024. This caused a by-election. ==Constituency profile== It includes the central and southern parts of Blackpool, including the famous Blackpool Tower, the three piers and the Pleasure Beach.
