 "text": "The Memphis Redbirds are a Minor League Baseball team from Memphis, Tennessee. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Redbirds are partnered with the St. Louis Cardinals, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Cardinals. The team is named \"Redbirds\" because of their partnership with the St. Louis Cardinalsâ€”cardinals are red birds. The Redbirds played at a stadium called Tim McCarver Stadium from 1998 to 1999. In 2000, the Redbirds began to play at a new stadium called AutoZone Park. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1990s establishments in Tennessee Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Memphis, Tennessee Category:St. Louis Cardinals",
