Cruz\") was established in 1594 by the Spanish colonizers, and later was populated and managed by a majority of merchants and traders â€” possibly because of its important location near the Pasig River and the mouth of Manila Bay. Soon it had shops and buildings rendering commerce and leisure. Currently, it is home to several historic buildings. Sta. Cruz was formerly a part of Quiapo Parish, before it became its own parish on June 20, 1619. Both Quiapo and Santa Cruz were villages of the ancient kingdom of Tondo. ==References== Category:Settlements in Manila Category:Districts of Manila",
