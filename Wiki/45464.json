 "text": "The Açaí palm (Assai palm) is a type of palm tree. There are seven different types of Açaí palms. The tree grows in Central and South America. It has a black-purple fruit about the size of a grape called a euterpe. The seed inside is very big. The fruit grows in bunches of 700 to 900 fruits. The palms are mainly used for two things: First, salads called palmitos (heart of palm) can be made from the leaves; for this, the tree needs to be cut down. Secondly, the fruits can be made into a fruit juice that is said to be very healthy. ==Images== Image:Açai no Mercado do Ver-o-peso.jpg|The fruits on a market, in Belem Image:Açaí.jpg|A typical serving of açaí juice == References == == Other websites == *Pictures of Açaí palms trees and fruit from an article by The Nature Conservancy. *University of Florida study confirms that açaí berries contain antioxidants that destroyed cultured human cancer cells *Jewelry made from Açaí seeds Category:Arecaceae Category:Fruits",
