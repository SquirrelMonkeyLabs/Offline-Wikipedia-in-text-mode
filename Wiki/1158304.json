 "text": "The San Martin rocket frog (Allobates sanmartini) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== Scientists think this frog lives in tropical forests. Scientists first saw the frog in exactly one place, 70 meters above sea level. There are protected parks in the place where the frog lives: Caura National Park and Jaua-Sarisari√±ama National Park. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the way other frogs in Allobates do: The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. But it lives in the Caura River Basin, where people cut down many trees, to get wood to build with, make towns, and dig in the ground for good rocks and metal. Some of these digs are legal and some are not. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
