It was meant to speed up the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession. Among many measures, the package boosted employment benefits for Americans by an extra $600 and provided direct cash payments of $1,200 or more. First proposed on January 14, 2021, the package expands from the CARES Act from March 2020 and in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, from December. The bill passed the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 219–212 on February 27. All but two Democrats voted for the bill and all Republicans voted against the bill. A fixed version passed the United States Senate on March 6 by a vote of 50–49.
