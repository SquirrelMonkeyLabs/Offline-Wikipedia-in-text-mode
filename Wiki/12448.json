 "text": "Strawberry Shortcake is a doll and pop culture character. Before she was a doll and animated character, she was a drawing on greeting cards. The doll has red hair and smells like strawberries. Kenner products created the first Strawberry Shortcake doll in 1979. At that time she resembled a typical rag doll, complete with freckles, a mop of red yarn hair, and a strawberry printed bonnet and a dress with apron, but the unique selling point was that, she smelt of strawberries. The Strawberry Shortcake line of characters each had their own fruit or dessert-themed name with clothing to match, and they each had a dessert or fruit-named pet. Like the Strawberry Shortcake doll, all the other charactersâ€™ dolls had hair scented to match their dessert theme. There was Apple Dumpling, the baby and Raspberry Tart who, in the television programs, was capable of the odd cutting remark. This is what Apple Dumpling looked like back in the 1980s. She first appeared on cards by American Greetings, and there soon were a series of dolls (each that smell like a different fruit and had a pet) and several TV specials produced by DIC and Nelvana. The characters in the collection from the 1980s were: *Strawberry Shortcake (with Custard the cat) *Huckleberry Pie (with Pupcake the dog) *Apple Dumplin' (with Teatime Turtle) *Blueberry Muffin (with Cheesecake mouse) *Raspberry Tart (with Rhubarb monkey) *Orange Blossom (with Marmalade the butterfly) *Lemon Meringue (with Frappe the frog) *Apricot (with Hopsalot the bunny) *Lime Chiffon (with Parfait Parrot) *Cherry Cuddler (with Gooseberry the goose) *Butter Cookie (with Jelly Bear) *Angel Cake (with Souffle' the skunk) *Mint Tulip (International friend from the Netherlands, with Marsh Mallard, the duck) *Crepe Suzette (International friend from France, with Eclair the poodle) *Cafe Ole (International friend from Mexico, with Burrito the burro) *Almond Tea (International friend China, with Marza Panda) *Lem 'n Ada (Twin International friends from the United Kingdom, with Sugar Woofer the dog) *Plum Puddin' (with Elderberry Owl) - formerly a boy, became a girl *Peach Blush (with Melonie Belle the lamb) *Banana Twirl (She always likes to exercise) *T N' Honey - An English inventor girl *Purple Pie Man (with Captain Cackle the berry bird) villain man *Sour Grapes (with snake Dregs) villain woman *The Berry Princess- a magical woman who helps berries grow and gives them scent ==2000s revival== In 2003, after other 1980s toys (Care Bears, My Little Pony, G.I.
