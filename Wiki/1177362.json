 "text": "A Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church is an official in the papal household who takes care of the property and money of the Holy See. He is always a cardinal as set by the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus of 1988. Before the 15th century, the Camerlengo was not necessarily a cardinal. When there is no Pope in office (sede vacante), the Camerlengo runs the daily work of the Holy See and helps to prepare for a new pope. His coat of arms is used on the Churchâ€™s coat of arms during this time. The current Camerlengo is Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who was chosen on 14 February 2019 by Pope Francis. == Related pages == * Roman Curia * Vatican * Archbishop == References == Category:Catholicism",
