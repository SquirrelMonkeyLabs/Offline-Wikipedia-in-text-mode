 "text": "\"Spiderwebs\" is a pop rock song by No Doubt. The lyrics are about a man who keeps calling Gwen and reciting bad poetry to her. It was released as a single in 1995. On the record charts it peaked near #5 three weeks after release. Two separate music videos were made. One had exploding telephones. The other was set in a Japanese restaurant. Music Television (MTV) thought the telephone explosions were not good for young viewers to see, so they added more footage of the band.
