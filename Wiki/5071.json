 "text": "Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Urdu: Islāmī Jumhūriyah Pākistān), is a country in South Asia. It shares its border with India, Iran, Afghanistan and China. Pakistan has the fifth largest population (243.4 million) in the world and has a total land area of .or in simple words 881,000 km² This makes Pakistan the 34th largest country in the world by land area. It has a 1,365 km long coastline along the Arabian Sea in the south. The capital of Pakistan is Islamabad, but before 1960, it was Karachi, which is now the country's largest city. While they were building Islamabad, Rawalpindi served as the temporary capital from 1959 to 1967. Pakistan has a rich history with ancient cultures, such as the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh, the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, and the ancient Gandhara civilization. Over the years, various empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid, Maurya, Kushan, Gupta, Macedonians, Mongols, Tibetans, Umayyad Caliphate, Samma, Hindu Shahis, Shah Miris, Ghaznavids, Delhi Sultanate, Mughals, and the British Raj, have influenced the region. Pakistan is also associated with the origins of major world religions like Hinduism and Sikhism, as well as the Mahayana and Vajrayana branches of Buddhism, rooted in the Gandhara region. Pakistan is a middle power nation with the world's sixth-largest standing armed forces. It is a nuclear-weapons state and is considered among the emerging and growth-leading economies, boasting a large and rapidly growing middle class. Pakistan's political history has seen periods of substantial economic and military growth, along with times of political and economic instability. The country is ethnically and linguistically diverse, with varied geography and wildlife. However, Pakistan also faces challenges like poverty, illiteracy, corruption, and terrorism. == Name == The Islamic name Pakistan (English pronunciation: or ; ) means 'Land of (the) Spiritually Pure' in both Urdu and Persian languages. It alludes to the word pāk meaning pure in Persian and Pashto. The suffix (-stān) is a Persian word meaning the place of, and also recalls the synonymous (and cognate) Sanskrit word sthāna . Many South- central Asian states and regions end with the element -stan, such as Karakalpakstan, Afghanistan, Sindhustan, Balochistan, Kurdistan, and Turkistan. This -stan is formed from the Iranian root *STA \"to stand, stay,\" and means \"place (where one stays), home, country\". Iranian peoples have been the main inhabitants of the various land regions of the Ancient Persian Empires now inhabit by the naturalised states for more than 1,500 years. The names are compounds of -stan and the name of the peoples living there. PAKISTAN is exceptionally unique; its naming is a compound of 2 names; which was coined on the 28th of January in 1933 AD as by Choudhary Rehmat Ali Khan respectively, a Cambridge University Moslem student and a Pakistan Movement activist, who published it in his paper Now or Never. by using the suffix -istan from Balochistan preceded by the first letters of Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir and Sindh. The name is actually an acronym that stands for the \"Thirty million Muslim brethren who live in Pakistan—by which we mean the Five Northern units of India viz: The Punjab, (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sind, and Baluchistan\". The letter “ī” that was incorporated to ease pronunciation and elegantly forms the linguistical corrective and a Respective name meaningfully. Most notably interestingly, a word almost identical in form, etymology, and meaning to the Iranian suffix -stan is found in the Polish language, which has a word Stan meaning \"State\" (in the senses of both Polity and Condition). It can be found in the example of a Polish name for the \"United States of America,\" Stany Zjednoczone Ameryki (literally \"States United of America\"). Thus, The name Pākistān means “Land of the Pure” in Persian and Urdu Respectively. == History == Pakistan became Independent in 1947 from the United Kingdom which was known as the British Raj. The first humans in Pakistan were the Soanian hunter-gatherers, who lived 50,000 years ago. Three of the world's oldest civilisations are in Pakistan, these include Mehrgarh civilisation, the Indus Valley civilisation and the Gandhara civilisation. The first urban centre in South Asia was the Mehrgarh, a 11,000-year-old site in Pakistan. The first organised people in Ancient Pakistan were the ones who made the Indus Valley Civilization, they lived 9000 years ago. After that, the Vedic period came. After the Muslim conquest, Pakistan began to be Islamized and it slowly turned into a Muslim majority region. The British Empire had effectively conquered the entire territories of modern-day Pakistan by the year 1849 and after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the region was officially absorbed into the British Crown and came under direct British rule. Pakistan gained independence from British rule in 1947 however the Monarch of the United Kingdom (King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II) remained the monarch of Pakistan up until it officially became a republic in 1956. Until 1971, Pakistan also included an area in the North-east India region. This is now called Bangladesh. It lost that area after a war with the Indian Army and the joint militant group of Indo-Bangladeshi alliance of Mitro Bahini of West Bengal. During recent times Pakistan has been in the centre of world politics. This is first because of its support to guerrillas in Afghanistan, following a Soviet invasion 1979, and later during the 1990s because of its cooperation with and support for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. However, since 2000 Pakistan has supported the West in their war against fundamentalist terrorism, including the removal of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Despite not being part of the organization itself, Pakistan has developed close ties with and closely cooperated with the NATO organization assisting it in many of its military campaigns such as those in Bosnia and Somalia. Pakistan is a member of the Commonwealth. However, after the war in East Pakistan the country was excluded (between 1972 and 1989). It was also a member between 1999 and 2007, it was excluded in 2007 for a time but again became a member in 2008. == Geography and climate == There are many earthquakes in the area. The earthquake in 2005 with its earthquake center in Kashmir is the strongest recorded so far. Over 100,000 people were killed or wounded on 8 October 2005. Pakistan covers ,World Factbook. Retrieved 3 November 2006. roughly similar to the combined land areas of France and the UK. Its eastern regions are located on the Indian plate and the western and northern regions on the Iranian plateau and Eurasian landplate. Apart from the Arabian Sea coastline, Pakistan's land borders total — with Afghanistan to the northwest, with China to the northeast, with India to the south and east, and with Iran to the southwest. The northern and western highlands of Pakistan contain the towering Karakoram and Pamir Mountain ranges, which include some of the world's highest peaks, including K2 and Nanga Parbat . The Balochistan Plateau lies to the west, and the Thar Desert and an expanse of alluvial plains, the Punjab and Sindh, lie to the east. The Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the disputed territory of Occupied Kashmir to the Arabian Sea. Pakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The beginning and length of these seasons vary somewhat according to location. Rainfall can change radically from year to year, and consecutive patterns of flooding and drought are also not uncommon. ==International borders== Pakistan's International borders are the external borders of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. ===Geography=== Pakistan's geosphere is geographically unique. It is located within Southcentral Asia. It is an integral part of Greater Middle East Region, with the Indus River and its tributaries as its main water supply or lifeline, the world's largest Irrigation system. The nation is bordered by the Hindu Kush and Sulaiman Mountain ranges in the west, Karakoram Mountain range in the north, Sutlej River and Thar desert in east, and Arabian Sea in the south. ===Historical background=== The country in its present form was created by the Pakistanis themselves out of the imperial colonial British Raj. ===Surrounding nations=== Pakistan borders the People's Republic of China in the north (Xinjiang Autonomous Türkic Region), and in the north-east Tibet Autonomous Region, the disputed territory of Occupied Kashmir which was part of the British Indian territory until 1948 is also included. Pakistan borders the entire eastern length of the country with the Republic of India and on the south towards the Arabian Sea, to the north-west Pakistan is separated by fourteen kilometres of a narrow strip of the Afghan-occupied Gorno-Badakhshan territory called the Wakhan Corridor which extends between Northern Pakistan and Tajikistan. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is to the west and north, and Iran (Ancient Persia) is to the southwest. Pakistan also shares to the extreme south-west a marine border with Oman. ===Land borders of Pakistan=== Land Border Country Length (m) and (m) Force Comments Afghanistan Pakistan Army Also see Durand Line As of January 2019, 900 km has been completed. China Gilgit Baltistan Scouts and Northern Light Infantry Depends on the Resolution of territorial conflicts between Islamabad and New Delhi. Article 6 of the 1963 Sino-Pakistan treaty provides for a renegotiation of the China-Pakistan boundary if the Kashmir dispute is resolved. However, with Indian relations have deteriorated with China, and poor-to-hostile with Pakistan, it is unlikely the boundary dispute will be resolved anytime soon. Also see Kashmir conflict. Republic of India (Bharat) Pakistan Rangers and Pakistan Army Also see Rann of Kutch, Operation Gibraltar and Kori Creek. Iran Pakistan Army Also see Goldsmid Line (Open border). Tajikistan (de jure) The pass was crossed by a couple in 1950 and by a couple in 2004. See J.Mock and K. O'Neil: Expedition Report Pakistan Army and Gilgit Baltistan Scouts Tajikistan claims a border with Pakistan specifically via the Wakhan Corridor (under Afghan's control) with the disputed Gilgit-Baltistan (PAK) northern Pakistani region, which is currently under Pakistani administration (see Kashmir dispute). ===Maritime borders of Pakistan=== The Maritime borders of Pakistan are the maritime boundary recognized by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Government of Pakistan promulgated Territorial and Maritime Zones Act 1976. In 1997, Pakistan also declared a straight baseline along its coast. Now the territorial sea is measured 12 nautical miles into sea from the baseline. Using Unclos III, Pakistan has also demarcated its sea boundaries with both Iran and Oman. Sea frontier with India in the East remains in dispute. Pakistan and India have held 12 rounds of discussions for deciding the exact sea frontier at Kori Creek and the un-demarcated Rann of Kachchh. At times, the negotiations appear promising. However, there has been no progress since June 2012. Pakistan's coastline is 1,146 Square kilometres² (712 Square miles²) long, with its claim of a territorial maritime zone and exclusive economic zone, has a more than maritime border shared with the three nations namely: Maritime Border Country Force Comments India Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Coast Guard Kori Creek Iran Pakistan Navy Sea of Oman Oman Pakistan Navy Arabian Sea == Government and politics == Pakistan has a federal parliamentary system. The head of state is an indirectly elected ceremonial President. The Electoral college of the country, (composed of the Senate, the National Assembly, and the four Provincial Assemblies) chooses a leadership representing the President of Pakistan for a five-year term. The president is also the Commander in Chief of the Joint Armed Forces. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is also indirectly elected. The President's appointment and term are constitutionally independent of the Prime Minister's term. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly or of a coalition in the National Assembly. The Prime Minister is the head of government. Pakistan's legislature is made of a 100-member Senate (upper house) and a 342-member National Assembly (lower house).

Military dictators include Ayub Khan in the 1960s, General Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. Pakistan's two largest political parties are the Pakistan People's Party and the government party Pakistan Muslim League (N).Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has also gained popularity in the past years. On 27 December 2007, the leader of the Pakistan People's Party, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated. The reason is yet to be determined. === Administrative divisions === Pakistan is made up of four provinces, two Federally administered territories and two autonomous territories. Both special areas are in Kashmir. The provinces and territories are divided into 26 divisions with now 147 districts directly divided from the provinces. Each district is divided into several tehsils and each tehsil is divided into several union councils. There are around 596 tehsils and over 6,000 union councils in Pakistan. Provinces: # Balochistan # Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly NWFP) # PunjabNot to be confused with the Indian state of Punjab. Both together make up the Punjab region. # Hindoo/Hindu, latter India. Among the four provinces, Punjab has the most people, but Balochistan is the largest province by area. (Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa also have Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (PATA) which are going to be regular districts.) Territories: 5. Islamabad Capital Territory 6. Federally Administered Tribal Areas Autonomous Areas (Pakistan-administered Kashmir) 7. Azad Kashmir 8. Gilgit Baltistan India, Pakistan and China separately control parts of the Kashmir region. India and Pakistan's parts are divided by a Line of Control. The Pakistan–China border is internationally recognized. Trade is common between the 2 countries. === National symbols === National symbols of Pakistan (Official) National animal Markhor National bird Chukar National tree Cedrus deodara National flower Jasminum officinale National heritage state animal Snow Leopard National heritage state bird Shaheen Falcon National aquatic marine mammal Indus river dolphin National reptile Indus Crocodile National fish Tor putitora National amphibian Bufo stomaticus National butterfly Indian purple emperor National fruit Mango National staple crop Sugarcane National beverage Sugarcane juice National vegetable Okra National cuisine Pakistani Biryani (Beef) National sport Field hockey National dress Salwar kameez National mosque Faisal Mosque 50px National mausoleum Mazar-e-Quaid National river Hindu River National mountain K2 ==Economy== Pakistan has a semi- industrialized economy. The growth poles of the Pakistani economy are situated along the Indus River. Diversified economies of Karachi and Punjab's urban centres, coexist with less developed areas in other parts of the country. Despite being a very poor country in 1947, Pakistan's economic growth rate has been better than the global average during the following four decades, but incautious policies led to a slowdown in the late 1990s. Recently, large economic reforms have resulted in a stronger economic outlook and sped up growth especially in the manufacturing and financial services sectors. Since the 1990s, there has been great improvement in the foreign exchange market position and rapid growth in hard currency reserves. The 2005 estimate of foreign debt was close to US$40 billion. However, this decreased with help from the International Monetary Fund and significant debt-relief from the United States. Pakistan's gross domestic product, as measured by purchasing power parity, is estimated to be $475 billion while its per capita income stands at $1,842. The poverty rate in Pakistan is estimated to be between 23% and 38%. == People == === Languages === There are dozens of languages spoken in Pakistan. Urdu and English are two official languages of the country. English is still spoken among the Pakistani elite and in most government ministries. Other major languages spoken in Pakistan include; Saraiki, Punjabi, Hindko, Pashto, Sindhi, Balochi, Brahui, Khowar, Balti and many others. Shina is also one of the regional languages of Pakistan. It is spoken in Gilgit-Baltistan. === Religion === Most (90-95%) of the people are Muslim. Sunni Muslims constitute 70-75% of Pakistan's populations and Shia Muslims 20-25%. Many other religions are followed in Pakistan too, these are Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Baha'i Faith, Zikrism, Ahmadiyya, Judaism, Buddhism and Animism. After the end British India, Hinduism had much less importance in the newly created state of Pakistan but has played an important role in its culture and politics as well as the history of its regions. In fact, Pakistan has the 4th largest population of Hindus in the world. The word \"Indo-\" or \"Hindu\", root of it's nouns like \"Hinduize(-d/-r/-in/-ism)\", \"Hindutva~~vadi~~ \", \"Hindi\", \"Indonesia\" and \"India\" is adapted from Classic~~al~~ Persian word \"هندو/Hindoo/Hindū\", a rip- off of Mid~~dle~~ Persian word \"Hindook/Hindūg\", out of the Proto-Persian word \"𐏃𐎡𐎯𐎢𐏁/Hindoo/Hindu\" that comes from Sindhu, Province of Pakistan, named after the Indus, which tells us Hindu referred to the archenemy of Bharat/India, Pakistan. The Sindhu is One of the Holy Rivers of Hinduism. Thus, in many ways, Pakistan has played an important part in the origin of Hinduism. There are about 4-10 million Hindus living in Pakistan, but most of them are concentrated in Punjab and Sindh, i.e., the Land of the Vedas. == Problems == Pakistani society also has a number of problems. *Many people think the government is unstable *There are still many people who cannot read or write well enough to cope in their everyday life *There were many military regimes. Even if there is the concept of electing officials, the idea of democracy is still developing. *Many people see Pakistan as a fragile state. Things like freedom of the press or the rights of minorities are often not guaranteed *Pakistan sees itself as an Islamic state. After it became independent many laws were changed so that Islam had a bigger influence. Many people in East Pakistan preferred the laws that did not refer to religion. In 1971, East Pakistan became independent. It is called Bangladesh today. *There are clashes between different social and ethnic groups. *There are blasphemy laws. Very often, these laws are used against minorities. Other problems are listed below === Poverty === Poverty in Pakistan is a growing concern because of population growth in the country. Although the middle-class has grown in Pakistan, nearly 50% of the population is classified poor as of September 2023. === Population growth === Pakistan has a high population growth. Between 1951 and 2017, the population increased by a factor of six. In 1951, there were 33.7 million people in Pakistan, in 2017, there were 207.7 million. Urbanization is ongoing. There are two megacities, Karachi and Lahore. Despite this, Pakistan has one of the lowest urbanization rates in the world. In 2017, over 130 million Pakistanis, or 65% of the population lived in rural areas. Pakistan also has high fertility rate. Estimates of 2022 are that on average, there are 3.5 children per adult woman. As a consequence, the Pakistanis are young: 40.3% of the people are 15 years or younger, only 3.7% of the people are 65 or older. The median age in the country is 19. This means that half the population are 19 or younger, the other half are over 19. There are also many refugees. The UNHCR estimated, that Pakistan has the forth-largest refugee population worldwide. == Sports == The national sport of Pakistan is field hockey, although cricket is the most popular game across the country. The national cricket team has won the Cricket World Cup once (in 1992), were runners-up once (in 1999), and co-hosted the games twice (in 1987 and 1996). Pakistan were runners-up in the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa and were the champions at the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 held in England. The team also won two Asia Cups in 2000 and 2012. Lately however, Pakistani cricket has suffered heavily due to teams refusing to tour Pakistan after militants attacked the touring Sri Lankan team in March 2009, after which no international cricket was played until May 2015, when the Zimbabwean team agreed to tour. However, now, with increased security, the Sri Lankan cricket team came for a tour as recently as 2019. In addition to sports like field hockey, cricket, squash rackets, football and others, Pakistanis are also very keen on equestrianism of various types,and equestrian sports such as Polo and the traditional Tent pegging are played by many. Other traditional rural sports include two types of Wrestling, Kabbadi and a martial art called Gatka. ==Related pages== * History of Pakistan * Religions of Pakistan * List of rivers of Pakistan * Political families of Pakistan * Transportation in Pakistan * Pakistan at the Olympics * National symbols of Pakistan == References == Notes ==Other websites== * Pakistan at CIA World Factbook Category:1947 establishments in Asia Category:English-speaking countries Category:Federations Category:Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Category:Commonwealth member states Category:Borders of Pakistan",
