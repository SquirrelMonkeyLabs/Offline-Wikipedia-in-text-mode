 "text": "The predicate in traditional grammar is the second part of a clause or sentence, the first being the subject.A good introduction is: Crystal, David 1995. The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language. Cambridge University Press, p220. A predicate completes an idea about the subject, such as what it does or what it is like.Allerton D. 1979. Essentials of grammatical theory. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.Huddleston, R. 1988. English grammar: an outline. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. ::She dances. \\- verb-only predicate ::Ben reads the book. \\- verb + direct object predicate ::Ben's mother, Felicity, gave me a present. \\- verb + indirect object + direct object predicate ::She listened to the radio. \\- verb + prepositional object predicate ::They elected him president. \\- verb + object + predicative noun predicate ::She met him in the park. \\- verb + object + adjunct predicate ::She is in the park. \\- verb + predicative prepositional phrase predicate The predicate provides information about the subject. :: The subject NP is shown in green, and the predicate VP in blue. There is a quite different theory of sentence structure, called dependency structure grammar. This puts the finite verb (= conjugated verb) as the root of all sentence structure. It rejects the binary NP-VP division. == References == Category:Grammar",
