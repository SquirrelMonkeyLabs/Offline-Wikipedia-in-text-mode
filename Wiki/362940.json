 "text": "The Iowa Senate is the upper house of the Iowa General Assembly, Iowa's legislature. There are 50 people in the Senate, one for each of 50 districts in Iowa. Each district has about 59,500 people in it. Each Senate district is composed of two House districts. The Senate meets at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines. Unlike the Iowa House of Representatives, Senate members - called \"senators\"â€”have terms of four years. Half of the Senate is elected every two years, in even-numbered years. There are no term limits for the Senate. ==Leadership== The President of the Senate is the leader of the Senate and serves as its chair. The Senate President also sends legislation to committees. Unlike the Speaker of the Iowa House, the Senate President does not put representatives on committees. The Lieutenant Governor of Iowa was the President of the Senate until 1991, when a constitutional amendment separated the jobs. Other Senate leaders, such as the majority and minority leaders, are elected by their party's members. ==Composition== Affiliation Party (shading indicates majority caucus) Party (shading indicates majority caucus) Party (shading indicates majority caucus) Total Affiliation Total Affiliation Democratic Republican Independent Total Vacant End 2012 26 23 0 49 1 Begin 2013 26 24 0 50 0 End of 2014 session 26 24 0 50 0 Begin 2015 26 24 0 50 0 End 2016 sessionDavid Johnson (District 1) switched parties from Republican to \"No Party\" on June 7, 2016. 26 23 1 50 0 Begin 2017 20 29 1 50 0 End 2018 20 29 1 50 0 Begin 2019 18 32 0 50 0 Latest voting share ===Past notable members=== * Steve King, U.S. House Representative, 2003 to present. * Samuel J.
