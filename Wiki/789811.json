 "text": "Vale of Leven Academy is a secondary school in Alexandria, Scotland. == History == The school opened in 1884, as North Public School. It became a secondary school in 1909. In 1962 it moved to it's current location. The school is located in the south of Alexandria. A new extension to the building was built in 1973 because the school was overcrowded. In 1996 the school was used for scenes in a Scottish television show called Take the High Road. On Saturday, 22nd June 2002, the extension to the school was set on fire and was destroyed. Classes were taught in temporary huts after the fire. A new building was constructed in 2009 and the original building was demolished. A bomb was brought in by a pupil in 2011 as part of a history project. The school was evacuated. The Royal Naval Bomb Disposal Squad removed the bomb and it was safely blown up. In September 2018, the school was evacuated because of a fire started by a pupil in the toilets. There was not a lot of damage and the school reopened the next day. == Head Teachers == Head teachers include: * Alex Rannie (c. 1965-74) * Tom Murray (1974 - c. 1980) * Duncan Penny * Angus McDonald * Terry Lanagan * Catriona Robertson (2009-16) * Paul Darroch (2016-17) * Matthew Boyle (2017 - present) == Notable Students == * David Currie - TV Presenter * Peter Haining - Rower * Bobby Kerr - Footballer * Ian McColl - Footballer * Sharleen Spiteri - Lead singer of band, Texas * Stuart David - co-founder of the bands Belle and Sebastian and Looper * Kelly Ann Woodland - STV News Presenter * Lynn Faulds Wood - TV Presenter == Images == File:Vale of Leven Academy - geograph.org.uk - 1714166.jpg|The new school building File:Vale of Leven Academy - geograph.org.uk - 1074184.jpg|The old school building File:Vale of Leven Academy - geograph.org.uk - 1471740.jpg|The old school building being demolished == References == Category:Schools in Scotland",
