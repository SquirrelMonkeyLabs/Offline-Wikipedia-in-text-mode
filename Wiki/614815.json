McKinley Park is served by three neighborhood newspapers: the Bridgeport News, the Archer Journal News and the Brighton Park/McKinley Park Life. The neighborhood newspapers are delivered weekly on Wednesdays to homes, businesses and other establishments throughout the neighborhood. Two stops on the Orange Line rapid transit have boosted property values and created the development of a shopping mall on Archer and Ashland Avenue.
