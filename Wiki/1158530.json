 "text": "An original design manufacturer (ODM) is a company that designs and makes a product, which is later sold under another company’s brand. This helps the brand company sell products without needing to design them or run a factory. The products made by an ODM can be the brand’s main business or a side business, like selling other goods in a store. This is different from a contract manufacturer, where the brand company designs the product and gives the design to the manufacturer. ODMs often create their own technologies and register patents, mostly in the US, China, and Taiwan. == References == === Citations === Category:Manufacturing companies",
