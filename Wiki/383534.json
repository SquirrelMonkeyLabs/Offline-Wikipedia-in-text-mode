While doing so, an evil being named Yin-Yarn takes Kirby into Patch Land, a place made out of yarn. There, Kirby's body becomes yarn. Kirby also has the ability to transform. This was given to Kirby by the tomato he ate earlier. Kirby uses this ability to rescue a boy named Prince Fluff. Prince Fluff says that Yin- Yarn broke Patch Land into different pieces that were held together by magic yarn. Kirby has to help him find the pieces of the magic yarn to restore Patch Land to normal. ==Gameplay== In Kirby's Epic Yarn, Kirby does not have his inhale ability. Instead, Kirby has a whip-like attack. Kirby can use it both to attack enemies and turn them into yarn. Kirby can also no longer float in air with his breath. Instead, he transforms into an parachute. Kirby can also transform into a car and a dolphin. The car makes Kirby faster, while the dolphin allows him to go underwater. Each level has three treasure chests to collect. There are also colored beads, which increases the player's score. Having a high score earns medals. The chests and medals unlock extra levels. Beads can be used to purchase furniture and wallpapers. These can be used to change Kirby's living space. Unlike the other Kirby games, Kirby does not have health or lives. If Kirby is damaged or falls into a bottomless pit, he loses some of his beads. ==References== Category:2010 video games Category:Kirby Category:Cooperative video games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Platform games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii games Category:Wii U games",
