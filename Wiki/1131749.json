It is one of the largest species of the Cyprinidae family, aside from the giant barb. == Etymology == The species name, esocinus, means \"pike-like wolf-barbel\" (named after the northern pike). == Description == === Physical appearance === The mangar looks like a pike in appearance. The body is covered with small scales. The mouth has no teeth. It has a big head, one dorsal fin, and a pair of pectoral and ventral fins. === Where it lives === It lives in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Adults move to larger rivers. === What it eats === Mangars eat many animals, from zooplankton and invertebrates to fish and birds. == Conservation == The mangar is classified as Vulnerable due to overfishing and habitat loss.
