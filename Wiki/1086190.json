They play once as a single and a four, then again as a pair and a triple. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded and there is also a trophy for the best overall team -- the Leonard Trophy for men and the Taylor Trophy for women. Northern Ireland & the Republic of Ireland compete as one combined Irish team. ==References== Category:Bowls Category:World championships",
