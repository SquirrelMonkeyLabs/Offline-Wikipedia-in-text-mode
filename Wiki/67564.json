 "text": "The Tang dynasty () (June 18, 618 – June 4, 907) was an imperial dynasty of China. ==History== The Tang Dynasty came after the Sui Dynasty (隋) and was followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (Traditional Chinese: 五代十國). It was founded by the Li (李) family, who came to power during the fall of the Sui Dynasty. The dynasty was interrupted briefly by the Wu Zhou (Traditional Chinese: 武周) usurper regime, which should be clearly distinguished from the Zhou Dynasty (Traditional Chinese: 周朝), which lasted from c. 1046 BC to 256 BC for 789 years during the classical antiquity. (October 16, 690 – March 3, 705) founded by Empress Wu Zetian (Traditional Chinese: 武則天) who managed to claim the throne, becoming the first and only Chinese Empress. The Tang Dynasty, with its capital at Chang'an (Traditional Chinese: 長安) in present-day Xi'an (Traditional Chinese: 西安), was the biggest city in the world at the time. It is considered by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization – maybe even greater than the earlier Han Dynasty (Traditional Chinese: 漢朝) – as well as a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Empress Wu, the first woman to ever rule in China, was also included in the Tang Dynasty. Her ruling methods were sometimes vicious, but she was very talented and intelligent. ==Related pages== * Taoism * East Asia * Silk Road * Buddhism * Central Asia * History of Asia * History of China ==Other websites== * The Tang Dynasty at the Metropolitan Museum of Art * Home of 300 Tang Poems, University of Virginia * The Tang Dynasty at AsianSpiritGallery ==References== Category:China Category:East Asia Category:Imperialism Category:Central Asia Category:Former empires Category:History of Asia Category:History of China Category:Chinese dynasties Category:618 establishments Category:900s disestablishments Category:7th-century establishments in Asia Category:10th-century disestablishments in Asia",
