 "text": "A myocyte (also known as a muscle cell)Daniel Albert et al 2012. Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary, 32nd ed, p321 & 697\\. Saunders/Elsevier Philadelphia, PA. is the type of cell found in muscle tissue. Myocytes are long, tubular cells. They develop from myoblasts to form muscles in a process called myogenesis.Myocytes at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) There are various specialized forms of myocytes: cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. They have different structures. The striated or striped cells of cardiac and skeletal muscles are called muscle fibers. Cardiomyocytes are the muscle fibres which form the chambers of the heart. They have a single central nucleus. Skeletal muscle fibers help support and move the body. They usually have peripheral nuclei. Smooth muscle cells control involuntary movements such as the peristalsis contractions in the oesophagus and stomach. == References == Category:Muscle tissue Category:Cells",
