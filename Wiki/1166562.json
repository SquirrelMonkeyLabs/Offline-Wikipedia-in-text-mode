 "text": "Poblacion (literally translated in Spanish, meaning \"population\") is practiced in the Philippines as a term to describe the central area of a settlement. It can also refer to the administrative location, downtown, old town or mercantile area of a Philippine city or municipality. ==History== During the Spanish rule of the Philippine islands, the colonial government founded hundreds of towns and villages across the archipelago modeled on towns and villages in Spain. The authorities often adopted a policy of \"Reduction\", meaning for the resettlement of local inhabitants to far-flung and scattered Barangay villages to \"gentrify\" a centralized location where churches and town halls would be built. This allowed the government to defend, control and Christianize the indigenous population, to conduct population counts, and to collect taxes. ==Gallery== File:Loboc Bohol 1.jpg|The poblaci√≥n of Loboc, Bohol, showing structures typical to most town centres: the plaza, town hall, gazebo, and arena File:View from Mayor's Office, San Narciso - panoramio.jpg|San Narciso, Zambales poblacion, showing the church and town plaza ==References== Category:Subdivisions of the Philippines",
