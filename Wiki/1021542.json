 "text": "An English royal consort was the spouse of the reigning king/queen of England (monarchs who ruled from 924 until England and Scotland joined together in 1707). The title held by a king's wife was usually \"The Queen\", the female equivalent of the king, and she shared certain formal privileges and responsibilities. However, unlike a queen regnant who was the ruler in her own right (such as Elizabeth I), a queen consort held no official power and played a largely ceremonial role, accompanied by the monarch on official engagements and receiving visiting heads of state. *",
