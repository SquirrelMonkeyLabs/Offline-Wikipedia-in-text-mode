Geddert was charged with physical, psychological and sexual abuse. One day after USA Gymnastics announced suspension of Geddert's membership pending investigation into the abuse allegations, Geddert retired from coaching. On February 25, 2021, Geddert shot himself at a rest area off Interstate 96 in Grand Ledge, Michigan, just hours after he had been charged with 24 felony crimes.
