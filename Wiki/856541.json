The small coastal residential community of mostly single-family homes is notable as a resort destination, and the home of several golf courses. Nonresidents are charged a toll to use 17-Mile Drive, the main road through Pebble Beach. ==History== Pebble Beach was originally a rocky cove and seashore that was once part of the Rancho Pescadero Mexican land grant. In the 1850s, Chinese immigrants formed a series of fishing settlements along Carmel Bay including one at Stillwater Cove, next to Pebble Beach. They collected abalone and various fish. In 1860, businessman David Jacks bought the Rancho, then sold it in 1880 to the Pacific Improvement Company. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in California Category:Settlements in Monterey County, California",
