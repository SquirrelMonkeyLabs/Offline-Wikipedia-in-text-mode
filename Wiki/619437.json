He was thought to have helped revive the language through his books. León-Portilla was important in bringing to light the works of Father Bernardino de Sahagún, who was a 16th-century primary source on the Aztec civilization and whose works have become one of the major references for cultural and historical information on Postclassic Central Mexico. On December 12, 2013, León-Portilla received the Living Legend Award from the U.S. Library of Congress.
