 "text": "The Province of Quebec was a colony in North America. It was created by Great Britain after the Seven Years' War. Great Britain acquired French Canada by the Treaty of Paris (1763). After a long debate France negotiated to keep the small island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe was rich in sugar. By Britain's Royal Proclamation of 1763, Canada (part of New France) was renamed the Province of Quebec.R. Douglas Francis; Richard Jones; Donald B.
