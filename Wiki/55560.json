 "text": "Pop Rocks are a kind of candy with carbonation added to make a \"popping\" feeling in the mouth of the person eating them. ==How do they pop?== The candy pops and fizzes because it contains bubbles of carbon dioxide under high pressure. When you melt the candy shell, the carbon dioxide escapes with a pop. When Pop RocksÂ® are made, the hot candy syrup is mixed with carbon dioxide gas under high pressure (600 pounds per square inch). ==Other websites== * Images of US patent 4289794 for Pop Rocks from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office * Pop Rocks: The Inside Story of America's Revolutionary Candy, book detailing the story of Pop Rocks development to Pop Rocks today * How do Pop Rocks candy work?, an article from HowStuffWorks that explains how pop rocks candy is manufactured and also has links to the original patent Category:Candy",
