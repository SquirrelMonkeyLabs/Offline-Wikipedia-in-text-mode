 "text": "Penile cancer is cancer of the penis. It is relatively rare in developed countries. In developing countries, however, it is much more common. It can be dangerous. Being uncircumcised is a risk factor for penile cancer. Circumcision lowers the chance of ever getting cancer of the penis to near zero. The foreskin is a possible source of penile cancer. Childhood circumcision has a strong protective effect against penile cancer in later life. Penile cancer has been nearly eliminated in populations of males circumcised shortly after birth. Circumcision nearly eliminates the risk of invasive penile cancer. Invasive penile cancer means the cancer begins to spread in the body. It is uncommon but often causes the man to die. == References == Category:Cancer Category:Male reproductive system Category:Diseases and disorders of the male reproductive system Category:Oncology Category:Obstetrics and gynecology",
