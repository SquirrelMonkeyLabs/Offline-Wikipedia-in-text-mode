 "text": "The Cali Cartel () was a drug cartel in southern Colombia, around the city of Cali and the Valle del Cauca Department. Its founders were the brothers Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela, and José Santacruz Londoño. They broke away from Pablo Escobar and his Medellín cartel in the late 1980s. When the Cali Cartel had high power from 1993 to 1995, they were seen as having control of over 80% of the world's cocaine market and were said to be directly responsible for the growth of the cocaine market in Europe, controlling 80% of the market there. By the mid-1990s, the Cali Cartel's international drug trafficking empire was a $7 billion a year. ==References== Category:Drug traffickers Category:Colombian criminals Category:Valle del Cauca",
