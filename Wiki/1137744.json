 "text": "Cheisaang Marol (), also known as Cheisang Maron (), is a form of martial arts practiced by the early Meitei people of Manipur. It uses a Cheisaang (a long stick) instead of a sword or a spear or other weapons. Before going to a battle or a hunt, people used sticks to practice this martial art form. It is defensive and is very useful when surrounded by enemies. Usually, the martial artist uses one long stick and a short stick. The long stick is used like a spear and the shorter stick is used like a sword. Cheisaang Marol is closely related to “Sharit Sharak” (alias Sarit Sarak) and is also considered a part of the Thang-Ta. Cheisaang Marol is rarely performed in modern times. Once it was performed by the Kanglei Inat Thang-Ta Shindam Shanglen at the KCDO Complex at Kongpal Chanam Leikai in 2023. The martial arts instructors of the Kanglei Inat Thang-Ta Shindam Shanglen were encouraged to carefully and completely teach the “Cheishaang Marol” as they were taught by their teacher Late Leitanthem Heramot. == References == Category:Meitei culture Category:Martial arts",
