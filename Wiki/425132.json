 "text": "Titanium alloys are metals which contain a mixture of titanium and other chemical elements. They have very high tensile strength and toughness. They are light in weight, resist corrosion very strongly and can withstand extreme temperatures. However, the cost of both raw materials and processing is very high. Therefore, their use is limited to military applications, aircraft, spacecraft, medical devices, connecting rods on expensive sports cars and some high quality sports equipment and consumer electronics. == References == == Other websites == *Titanium and Titanium Alloys *General Titanium Alloys Property Data *Properties of Alpha/Beta Titanium Alloy Category:Alloys",
