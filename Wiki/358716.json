 "text": "A ballet blanc (literally, white ballet) is a ballet in the style of the 19th century romantic ballet. The ballerinas and the female members of the corps de ballet wear bell-shaped, calf-length, white ballet tutus. The second acts of La Sylphide and Giselle are representatives of the ballet blanc. Fokine's Les Sylphides is a 20th-century homage to the ballet blanc. Category:Ballet terminology",
