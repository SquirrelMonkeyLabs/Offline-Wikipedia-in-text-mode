 "text": "The Slovak National Uprising, was an uprising started by the Slovak partisans against Nazi Germany and the Slovak Republic during the European theatre of World War II. On August 23 1944 the Kingdom of Romania joined the Allies and declared war on Germany. The path to the Balkans was open for Soviet forces and began liberating the parts of Romania still occupied by German troops. The Slovak resistance saw this as an opportunity and began an uprising. German forces entered Slovakia and began to fight the newly formed First Czechoslovak Army in Slovakia and disarming the Slovak army in the east. Meanwhile the soviet forces (and the Czechoslovak corps) near the Slovak border were making their way into Slovakia to link up with the resistance. In October 1944, the Germans launched a coup in Hungary and formed a puppet government. And German forces invaded Slovakia from the Hungarian-Slovak border and the uprising was crushed on October 28 1944. Category:Nazi Germany",
