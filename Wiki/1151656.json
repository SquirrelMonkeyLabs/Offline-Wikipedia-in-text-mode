 "text": "The history of Australia from 1788 to 1850 covers the early British colonial period of Australia's history. == Arrival of the first fleet and early colonization == In 1788, the British sent the First Fleet to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay in New South Wales. Led by Arthur Phillip, the colony faced early challenges, including food shortages and unfamiliar conditions. The settlement moved to Sydney Cove due to better resources, marking the beginning of modern Australia. The colony's primary purpose was to house convicts after Britain lost its American colonies. == Expansion of settlement == By the early 1800s, settlements spread as British explorers crossed barriers like the Blue Mountains (1813), opening fertile lands west of Sydney. New settlements included Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and inland towns like Bathurst. These expansions often displaced Aboriginal Australians, causing conflict and significant population loss due to disease and violence. == Convict transportation == Convicts were the backbone of early labor. Transportation peaked with thousands arriving annually until convict transportation to New South Wales ended in 1840. Freed convicts were sometimes granted land or rights, contributing to the colony's growth. Other colonies, like South Australia, were established without convict labor. == Agriculture and economy == Farming, particularly sheep grazing for wool production, became the main economic activity, supported by British capital. Banks like the Bank of New South Wales were established to handle trade. By the 1830s, land grants gave way to sales, and large-scale pastoralism expanded, often at the expense of Indigenous lands. == Indigenous impact == British colonization devastated Aboriginal populations, reducing their numbers and disrupting their cultures. Resistance and violent conflicts occurred, but settlers continued to claim land under the belief of terra nullius (land belonging to no one). == Colonial development == By 1850, separate colonies such as South Australia (1836) and Western Australia (1829) had been established, each with distinct policies. Discussions about self-governance began, laying the groundwork for Australia’s eventual federation in 1901. Category:History of Australia Category:19th century in Australia",
