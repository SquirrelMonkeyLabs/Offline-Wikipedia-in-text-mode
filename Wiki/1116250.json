 "text": "The Koli is an Kshatriya caste of India which is also known as Koliya in ancient time. It's mostly found in Gujarat, Maharastra , Himachal, Rajasthan Uttarpradesh. In the beginning of 20th century, the Koli caste was recognised as a Criminal Tribe under Criminal Tribes Act by British Indian government because of their anti-social activities but during the World War I, Kolis were recognised as a Martial caste by British Indian Empire. Kolis of Gujarat & Maharastra were well known Pirates of Arabian sea. In 1706, Durgadas Rathore raised a large Koli army in Surat of Gujarat and with the help of Koli chiefs attacked at Patan and killed the Mughal commander Shahkali Khan. Ahmednagar sultanate was dependent on Koli chieftains for military or soldiers. Koli chieftains of provided the cavalry and infantry for Sultans of Ahmednagar during wartimes. In 1753, The Maharawal of Banswara State, killed the three sons of Rana Ratansinhji of Sant State (Santrampur) and tried to capture the throne of Sant State; the fourth son who was an infant named Badansinghji was protected by Kolis of Gujarat and grew up in a Koli family. The Maharawal annexed the Sant State in Banswara State and established his army in Sant. After several years, when Badansinghji reached maturity, the Kolis of Santrampur attacked the army of Banswara. The Kolis of Sant (Santrampur) defeated the army of Maharawal and threw it out of Sant state. After that, Kolis of Malwa established Rana Badansinhji at the throne of Sant State. == History == The Patidars of Central and North Gujarat were agricultural labour on the lands of Koli landlords or Koli chieftains but after Independence of India, Patidars enchraoched the lands of Kolis through land ceiling act of Independent India and reduced the Kolis in social status. after that, Kolis thought that they ruled the area but have no rights, so Kolis often plunders the Patidar villages in midnight in gangs. The Rajputs of Gujarat strongly allied with Kolis because Rajputs also were against Patidars because of their land rights. In central and north Gujarat, the Kolis had several battles with the Patidars on the issue of land tenancy, land rights and use of common village resources. It may be mentioned here that in order to win the elections in 1962 and 1967 the Gujarat Swatantra Party, dominated by the Patidars, won over some of the Koli leaders of the Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha and Sabha was dominated by Kolis of North Gujarat . The Party evolved a strategy referred to by the acronym PKASH; that is the 'party of Patidars and Koli Kshatriyas.' Party nominated a large number of the Kolis as party candidates and also gave them positions within the party organization. But that alliance did not last. The party and the Kshatriya Sabha's Koli leaders could not resolve ground- level conflicts between the Koli peasants and well Patidar peasants. The grievances of Patidar were resolved by Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha by several time meetings but it was not enough because Kolis were double in number of population if Gujarat and Patidars often targeted by influenced Kolis. most of the Patidar's children were engaged in collage study but Kolis not and it was a big beneficial point of Patidars. Some of the Bhil chief's of early medieval Ahmedabad claim the status of Kolis in the medieval period. The Kolis of Gujarat being a part of the agricultural population, the Kolis might have included some other social groups claiming agriculturist status. The Kolis were not good cultivators in the medieval period and are not described as an economically homogeneous caste at the end of the nineteenth century. The character of the Kolis, as agriculturists, varies much in different parts of the Gujarat. Crimes of violence are occasionally committed among Kolis they were known as outlaw. but, as a warrior caste, they have settled down in the position of peaceful husbandmen marked contrast to their lawless practices fifty years ago. The Kolis of medieval Gujarat too figure in medieval source more as lawless elements than as peaceful producers. Raja Vikramajit, Shahjahan's governor of Gujarat, had to conduct an expedition in 1622 against Jagirdar Kolis in north of Ahmedabad who had been for generations a terror to travellers. Between 1662 and 1668, a Baluchi adventurer impersonating the late Dara Shikoh successfully gathered around himself a large number of the Kolis of Viramgam and Chunwal. The Mughal commander Mohabat Khan had to march out to drive him away and take control of the Kolis. Records of the East India Company mention that the Ahmedabad route to Surat was particularly dangerous because of the constant irruption of brigands, robbers, piracy and highwaymen Kolis. In fact, in 1644, some Kolis attacked a caravan between Ahmedabad and Broach, Kolis armed with bows and arrows and muskets attacked Fidauddin Khan's forces in the mid-eighteenth century; the Kolis also launched guerrilla attacks on Gaikwad forces. But it is significant that the eighteenth-century Kolis of Gujarat refused to accept the Bhils as a Koli, Alexander K. Forbes, writing on the Kolis and the Bhils of Mahikantha in the period of the Gaikwads, mentions that tribal bhils were trying to be in Koli status. The above point indicates that the status of \"Koli' had become a respectable one for those tribal groups in Gujarat who sought to distinguish themselves from the larger mass of their kinsmen. The Kolis seem to have attained an important socio political status by the fourteenth century, at least on Konkan coast in Maharashtra. A Koli kingdom is known to have been founded by Jayba Popera in North Konkan in 1342. The chief of the celebrated Janjira fort was a Koli named Ram Patil in the time of Shivaji, Kolis had served the Maratha army under their Koli commanders Yesaji Kank and Tanaji Malusare since the time of Shivaji and exercised considerable control over the Konkan coast. The Bahmanis conferred the rank of Sardar on Koli chiefs who held charge of hill tracts. In contrast, we have noted that the Kolis of Gujarat were mostly perceived as a predatory tribe. From the way they are described in the literature of the medieval period and in travellers accounts, we suspect that some descendants of medieval Bhil chiefs, particularly those of Ahmedabad, could have claimed the status of Koli. == Koli clans and titles == == Koli pirates == A largest number of Kolis lives in Gujarat and Kathiawar of Gujarat has always been famous for its Koli Piracy. In times of unsettled British government, the coasts of Kathiawar have swarmed with Koli pirates, who, from the shelter of every creek and headland, took toll on all merchandise Ships that was carried on the Arabian Sea. Along the southern coast the leading pirates were Shial Koli, Baria Kolis, while, in the Gulf of Cutch and near Dwarka and Porbandar, from an early date, Other Kolis made their names a terror to merchants. === Ghogha and Piram Islands === In 1326, Ghogha and Piram Islands of Gujarat was stronghold of Koli pirates and they often lavied or attacked the ships of traders passed by nearby sea. But Koli pirates were defeated by the Mokhadaji. Later in 1340, Mokhadaji was defeated by Sultan Mohammad Bin Tughluq of Delhi Sultanate and Koli pirates raised again and captured a English ship named ”’Morning Star”’ of big cost and loaded with cargo. === Shial bet Island === In 1531, Koli pirates of Shial island of South coast of Kathiawar in Gujarat captured the Shial island from Portuguese India and defeated the Portuguese Indian Navy.

They were egged on to continue their infamous activities owing to the patronage extended to them by some wealthy Kolis who shared their plunder. The British government despatched British Indian Navy under captain Radford Nunn and captain Daniel Inchbird and he captured 5 of their armed vessels and burnt 14 more. To save others from a similar fate, Nunn burnt nearly 50 small ships of Koli pirates. About six months later, 10 more of their boats were set on fire and these measures silenced them for some time. A letter from the Bombay Castle diary, dated Sunday, the 21st January, 1739, reveals that the Kolis had captured several vessels among which was the ”’Tiger Gallivet”’ (returning from Persia) in whose seizure the Kolis were chief pirates. A few years later in 1749, their renewed activities came to light once more, when they captured a ”’Bengal Ship”’ carrying rupees 60,000 cash and a Cargo worth an equivalent amount. To combat against Koli pirates, the Dutch India, joining hands with the British India in Surat. in December, 1750, both navy forced illegal activites of Koli pirates on the Kurla river. In this campaign, 23 of vessels were captured and this attack again compelled the Kolis to be inactive for a longer period. === Talaja === The Talaja coast In Bhavnagar State was infested by the Koli pirates of Kathiawad of Gujarat. They captured the trading ships of Britishers and Bhavnagar State. The British Navy with the help of Bhavnagar ruler Akherajji attacked and defeated the Koli pirates in 1771. But after death of Akherajji, Kolis again started collecting the tax from ships and captured two British and one Bhavnagar ship. In 1807, Wakhatsinji Akherajji Gohil join hands with British government to suppress the Koli piracy under ”’Walker Settlement”’ treaty for peace in Saurashtra ocean and again defeated the Koli pirates and congrats by Bombay government for his dare against Kolis. == Koli rebellion == == Distribution == * India, The Kolis are distributed all over.

A Koli chief named Laya Patil who was fleet chief in Maratha navy was honoured by Shivaji with the title of Sarpatil for his courageous attack at Janjira. In 1665, under Shivaji, The Koli soldiers played an important role on the fort of Purandar fort during the siege of Diler Khan.

The Koli corps continued to perform this duty till 1861. when they were disbanded and some of them entered in police service.
