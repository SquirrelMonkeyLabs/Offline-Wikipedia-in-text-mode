 "text": "High Intensity Training (HIT) is a form of strength training popularized in the 1970s by Arthur Jones. HIT focuses on performing quality weight training repetitions to the point of momentary muscular failure. The training takes into account the number of repetitions, the amount of weight, and the amount of time the muscle is exposed to muscle tension in order to maximize the amount of muscle fiber recruitment. ==References== ==Other websites== * Arthur Jones's Nautilus Bulletin #1 * Arthur Jones's Nautilus Bulletin #2 * What is High Intensity Training?
