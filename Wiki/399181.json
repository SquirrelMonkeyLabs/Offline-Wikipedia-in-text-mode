 "text": "The INS Dakar Memorial is a memorial dedicated to the 69 soldiers of the Israeli Navy of the submarine INS Dakar who died in the Mediterranean Sea in 1969. The remains of the submarine were found in 1999. The memorial is located in the Garden of the Missing Soldiers in the National Military and Police Cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. It is next to the wall of the names of the missing soldiers of Israel. The memorial was built with exposed concrete in a shape of a submarine; the lower half is submerged in the ground. On the front side a verse from the Bible is inscribed: Psalm 77:19: \"Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though Your footprints were not seen.\" Inside the memorial is the room with all the 69 names of the soldiers that died at sea. The memorial was built in 1970 by the architect David Anatol Brotzkos. == Gallery == file:PikiWiki Israel 12290 dakar submarine memorial in mount herzl.jpg file:The Dakar Memorial IMG 1303.JPG file:PikiWiki Israel 12289 dakar submarine memorial in mount herzl.jpg == Other websites == * the found of the INS Dakar in the \"submarines.dotan\" Category:Monuments and memorials in Mount Herzl Category:Military monuments and memorials in Israel",
