 "text": "\"Goo Goo Gai Pan\" is the 12th episode of The Simpsons 16th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on March 13, 2005. In the episode, the Simpson family goes to China so that Selma can adopt a baby there. Lucy Liu guest stars as Madam Wu, a Chinese person in the episode who helps with Selma's adoption. The episode was controversial in China because it made references of the Tiananmen Square protests. In the episode, a sign in the Tiananmen Square says \"On this site, in 1989, nothing happened\". This is a reference to China trying to censor the protests. Another part of the episode shows a parody of the Tank Man photo where Selma is the Tank Man and Wu is inside one of the tanks. In 2021, Hong Kong started their version of Disney+ which has The Simpsons. \"Goo Goo Gai Pan\" was not put on there because of its references to the Tianamen Square protests. == References == == Other websites == * Category:The Simpsons episodes Category:2005 television episodes",
