 "text": ":This article is about fourth-generation Japanese immigrants or emigrants. For other uses, see Yonsei. is a Japanese language term used in countries in North America and South America to name the children born to Japanese people who immigrated. The emigrants or immigrants who were born in Japan are called Issei; and their children born in the new country are called Nisei (second generation). The grandchildren of Issei are called Sansei (third generation) and their great-grandchildren are called Yonsei.The generation names come from the numbers \"one, two, three\" in the Japanese language. The first three Japanese numbers are \"ichi, ni, san.\" The fourth number is \"yon\". The character and uniqueness of the Yonsei is recognized in its social history.Numrich, Paul David. (2008). North American Buddhists in Social Context, p. 110. The Yonsei are the subject of on-going academic research in the United States and Japan.国立大学法人 東京学芸大学 (Tokyo Gakugei University), \"Socioeconomic Status, Acculturation, Discrimination, and Health of Japanese Americans: Generational Differences\" by Takashi Asakura et al., 2004; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant# 12490011; retrieved 2012-12-24. ==History== The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897.Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations; retrieved 2012-11-25. Imigration to Brazil began in 1908. Today, the community which grew from the immigrant children, grandchildren and great- grandchildren has become the largest Japanese emigrant population outside of Japan, including approximately 1.5 million Brazilians.MOFA, \"Japan-Brazil Relations\"; retrieved 2012-11-25. Other communities of Yonsei grew up in the United States,Sakata, Yasuo. (1992). Fading Footsteps of the Issei, p. 1. Canada,McLellan, Janet. (1999).

The use of the term Yonsei was modeled after an Issei pattern or template. In the 1930s, the term Issei came into common use. The word replaced the term \"immigrant\" (ijusha). This change in usage mirrored an evolution in the way the Issei looked at themselves. The label Issei also included the idea of belonging to the new country. == Cultural profile == The term Nikkei (日系) was created by sociologists in the late 20th century. The Nikkei include all of the world's Japanese immigrants and their descendants.Japanese American National Museum, \"What is Nikkei?\" ; retrieved 2012-11-25. The Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in another country by choice.Smithsonian, \"The Art of Gaman: Arts and Crafts from the Japanese American Internment Camps, 1942 - 1946\", Yoshitsuchi Ikemoto ; excerpt, \"... one of hundreds of Issei (first-generation) 'bachelor' laborers who were unable to send for their wives or a picture bride because the U.S. government cut off all immigration from Japan in 1924\"; retrieved 2012-11-25. Their Yonsei great-grandsons and great-granddaughters grew up with a national and cultural point-of-view that was different from their great-grandparents. Although the Issei kept an emotional connection with Japan, they created homes in a country far from Japan.Yenne, Bill. (2007). Rising Sons: The Japanese American GIs Who Fought for the United States in World War II, p. xv. The Yonsei had never known a country other than the one into which they were born.
