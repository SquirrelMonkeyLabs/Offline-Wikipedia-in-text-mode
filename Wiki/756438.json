 "text": "In Christianity, the Arrest and Trial of Jesus is an event that takes place in February/March of 30 AD, before the Death and Ressurrection of Jesus and after the Last Supper. ==Description== The New Testament Gospels all tell the story of how Jesus was arrested. His trial is told with many details. Jesus was with his disciples in a garden where He was praying. After dark, some soldiers came. With them was Judas Iscariot. Judas kissed Jesus to show the soldiers who He was. The soldiers took Jesus prisoner. All of the other followers of Jesus ran away. Jesus was taken to the high priest where he was questioned. He was accused of many things by false witnesses. Finally, the high priest asked Jesus if he was the Son of God. Jesus said it was true and that in the future he would come in the clouds. The high priest then said that Jesus was guilty of blasphemy. Since the Romans did not allow the Jewish authorities to kill anyone, Jesus was then brought to Pontius Pilate. Pilate was the Roman governor. He also asked Jesus many questions. Jesus didn't answer some of the questions, but he told Pilate that he was a king. But he said that his kingdom was \"not of this world\". Pilate wanted to release Jesus, but the crowd demanded instead that Jesus be crucified. To prevent a riot, Pilate agreed to their demand. ==Other== Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour- by-hour account of what is happening.Powell, Mark A. Introducing the New Testament.
