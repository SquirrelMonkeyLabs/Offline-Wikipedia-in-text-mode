 "text": "A network node is another name for a single computer in a network of other computers. In telecommunications networks, a node (Latin: nodus, ‘knot’) is either a redistribution point or a communication endpoint. The definition of a node depends on the network and protocol layer referred to. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a communication channel.[1] A passive distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.
