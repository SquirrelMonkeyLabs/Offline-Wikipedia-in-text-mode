 "text": "Die Lollipops is a children's band which formed in Germany in the summer of 2000 under the Edelkids label, a division of a German company named Edel Music. According to the label's website, the primary intended audience for the band is German-speaking children between 4 and 10 years old.http://www.edel.de/fileadmin/user_upload/kuenstler/edelkids/edelkids/Produktkatalog/edelkids- Produktuebersicht_Juli.pdf (page 34) == Music == Their music can be divided into three basic types: * Traditional children's songs, whether native or international; * Covers, or songs in which the melody is borrowed from a popular song (often from the English-speaking world) but the lyrics are unrelated; and * Original songs invented by the group. This accounts for the largest number of songs, especially in the more recent releases. Examples of famous international children's songs whose melody has been borrowed and given entirely new lyrics: :: Lollipops song Originalcoverinfo.de search for \"Lollipops\" Was zieh ich an When the Saints Go Marching In Yo, wir gehen zum Rodeo Old McDonald Had a Farm Ich hab ne Tante in Marokko She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain Von den blauen Bergen kommen wir She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain Radio Lollipop Polly Wolly DoodleThe album credits Hooray!

The most common German word for lollipop is Lutscher, but Germans now also use Lollipop. The band debuted in July 2000 with an album called die Lollipops and have released new CDs, videos, and audio books at the rate of about two per year. As of 2005, their label had sold more than 1.5 million of their CDs and videos, of which 8 made it to gold, and one made it to platinum.Biography for Die Lollipops - WindowsMedia.com Media Guide Note that the meanings of the terms platinum and gold are different for different countries: in Germany gold signifies 100,000 sales and platinum 200,000. Die Lollipops has featured two singers at a time for most of its history; generally these have been girls between the ages of about 11 and 16. Because the band has been around for nine years, they must replace their singers with new ones every few years. The current duet started recording in late 2007 with Susi and Fiona (then 12 and 11 years old respectively). They released an album called Einfach tierisch in March 2008, and plan to release another one called Immer in Bewegung in July 2009. Peter Hoffmann has remained the producer since the group was formed. The band has attracted composers from other bands registered by Edel Music; a singer named Klaus B端chner had written a song about drinking alcohol called Wir feiern wieder Feste in 1987 when he was singing in his own band, called Klaus & Klaus; he then re-wrote it as a children's song about a never-ending party for die Lollipops. The title of the song is still the same and the syllable rhythms are similar, especially in the chorus. Due to the language barrier, the Lollipops are largely unheard of outside the German-speaking world. Their music can be downloaded via websites such as Amazon.com. == Albums == * 2000: Die Lollipops * 2000: Winterwunderland * 2001: Komm wir geh'n ins Kino * 2001: Sing mit Uns * 2001: Hitzefrei * 2002: Einmal um die Ganze Welt * 2003: Freunde F端rs Leben * 2004: Tanzen, Lachen, Party machen * 2004: Wir Feiern * 2004: W端nsch Dir Was! * 2005: F端r Immer Ferien * 2005: Wir Wolln Spass * 2006: Reiterferien sind der Hit! * 2007: Party, Popcorn, Polonaise! * 2007: Zusammen sind wir Doppelt Stark * 2008: Einfach Tierisch * 2009: Immer in Bewegung * 2010: Jetzt geht's ab == References == == Other websites == * http://www.lollipops-musik.de/ * http://www.edelkids.de/ Category:German pop music groups Category:Folk music groups Category:Children's musical groups",
