 "text": "Hollister Co. is a clothing company owned by Abercrombie & Fitch. The kind of clothing they sell is casual, meaning that it is for informal use. It also has a theme based on the surfing cultural movement of Southern California. The first Hollister store opened in July 2000 in Columbus, Ohio.http://library.corporate- ir.net/library/61/617/61701/items/282722/Monthly_Store_Count_History_0708.pdf Even though Hollister opened in 2000, many of their items say it was created in 1922. This is based on a story that is not real. On October 25, 2008 Hollister opened the first store outside the U.S. and Canada in Brent Cross, London. ==References== Category:American clothing companies Category:2000s establishments in Ohio Category:Companies based in Ohio",
