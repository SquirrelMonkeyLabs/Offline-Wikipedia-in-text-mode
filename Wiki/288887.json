 "text": "Those with stereotypic movement disorder often hurt themselves. Some of them engage in certain behavior, such as keeping their hands in their pockets, to prevent these movements. ==Causes== Causes of stereotypic movement disorder involve certain physical conditions, head injuries and use of some drugs, including cocaine. ==Impact== Childhood habits can result in negative social interactions and avoidance by peers and family members. Some repetitive behavior can cause damage. ==Treatment== The most common treatment approaches used for children with such condition are therapies aimed at reducing stress that may trigger the movements and changing behavior. Some medications may also help reduce stereotypic behavior. Naltrexone has been used with some success in reducing stereotypic self-injurious behavior. In some cases, antidepressants such as Prozac, Zoloft and Luvox (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), or Anafranil (a tricyclic antidepressant) may be helpful. Category:Disorders",
