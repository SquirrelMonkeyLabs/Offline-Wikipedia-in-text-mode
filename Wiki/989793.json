 "text": "A third jersey (or altenative jersey, third kit or alternative uniform) is a jersey or uniform that a sports team can wear instead of its home or away outfits during games. This is often because the colors of two competing teams' other uniforms are too similar to tell the difference easily. In reality, there is never a need for a third jersey in a two-team game. One team can wear its home or normal colours, and the other team can wear its away or substitute colours. Basically, the latter teams' colours cannot clash with the former's. This leaves the possibility that each team's away jersey is so similar, that by accident' the home team may be confused to see the away team in colours that they occasionally play in. But that is a risk for the away team seeing the home team in colours that are not unlike the colours the away team normally wears. Category:Sports clothing",
