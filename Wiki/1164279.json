 "text": "Imam Khomeini International Airport is the main international airport of Tehran, Iran's capital. It is located 2 kilometers (1 mile) from Vahnabad and 35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of Tehran. The airport is named after Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's first supreme leader, and is run by Imam Khomeini Airport City Company. It covers 13,400 hectares (33,000 acres) with two terminals and two runways. All international flights to Tehran land here, while domestic flights use Mehrabad Airport. Imam Khomeini Airport is a hub for several airlines and was the third busiest airport in Iran in 2019. The airport was planned before the 1979 revolution because Mehrabad Airport was overcrowded. It was supposed to open in May 2004, managed by a Turkish- Austrian company (TAV). However, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps closed it right after the first plane landed, citing security concerns about foreigners managing the airport. Some in parliament claimed TAV had ties to Israel, though the company denied this. The airport reopened in April 2005 with Iranian airlines running it. A second terminal was added in 2019. == References == == Other websites == * Official Website Category:Airports in Asia Category:Buildings and structures in Tehran Category:Transport in Iran",
