 "text": "The linsangs are four feliform species, two in Asia and two in Africa. The whole group was put in the Viverridae in a subfamily. The two pairs are: The species of African linsangs are: *Poiana leightoni – Leighton's linsang *Poiana richardsonii – African linsang The species of Asiatic linsangs are: *Prionodon linsang – Banded linsang *Prionodon pardicolor – Spotted linsang DNA analysis shows: # the African linsangs (Poiana) are true viverrids closely related to the genet. # the Asiatic linsangs (Prionodon) are not, and may be the closest living relatives of the Felidae family.Gaubert, Philippe and Veron, Geraldine 2013. Exhaustive sample set among Viverridae reveals the sister-group of felids: the linsangs as a case of extreme morphological convergence within Feliformia. The Royal Society. Discovering this, the Asiatic linsangs are now put into a family of their own. They are not viverrids. Therefore, the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent. All of them are cat-like in appearance. They are nocturnal, generally solitary tree dwellers. They are carnivorous, eating squirrels and other rodents, small birds, lizards and insects. Typical size is a little over 30 cm (1 foot), with a tail that more than doubles that length. Bodies are long, with short legs, giving a low appearance. All species have yellowish bodies with black markings (stripes, blotches and spots), though the distribution and nature of the markings varies between species. == References == Category:Viverrids Category:Feliformia",
