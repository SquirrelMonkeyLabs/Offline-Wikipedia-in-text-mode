They remote control it from the ground like a civilian drone but with a computer at a ground control base instead of a remote controller. From the terminal one crew member operates the sensors and weapons. The other crew member is the commander and pilot of the drone. It has many video cameras and sensors and is able to Takeoff and land on its own. The Reaper is mostly used for reconnaissance. It can also do loitering, close air support along with search and rescue. Because of its cameras and sensors the drone is used to point out targets for military vehicles and other aircraft. It is also used to guard groups of military vehicles. When used for strike missions the drone is very accurate. Up to eight missiles can be put on the wings.
