 "text": "Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent in the Western Christian calendar. It occurs 46 days before Easter. The date is different each year because the date of Easter varies. It can fall as early as February 4 and as late as March 10. Those able to and willing to should fast voluntarily between Ash Wednesday and Easter. There are exceptions, though. Pregnant women, sick people, children, and the old usually don't have to. Ash Wednesday is a very important part of Lent. ==Dates== The dates of Ash Wednesday are: 2000 March 8 2001 February 28 2002 February 13 2003 March 5 2004 February 25 2005 February 9 2006 March 1 2007 February 21 2008 February 6 2009 February 25 2010 February 17 2011 March 9 2012 February 22 2013 February 13 2014 March 5 2015 February 18 2016 February 10 2017 March 1 2018 February 14 2019 March 6 2020 February 26 2021 February 17 2022 March 2 2023 February 22 2024 February 14 2025 March 5 2026 February 18 2027 February 10 2028 March 1 2029 February 14 2030 March 6 ==Related pages== * Advent * Carnival * Lent * Easter * Pentecost * Trinity Sunday Category:Christian holidays",
