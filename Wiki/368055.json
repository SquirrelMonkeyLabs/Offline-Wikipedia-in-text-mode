It is about south-west of Alice Springs and about from the place where the borders of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory meet (known as the Surveyor-General's Corner). The settlement is surrounded by the Tomkinson Ranges. It was previously known as Mount Davies by most Australians, after the highest local peak. The settlement of Kalka is about away by road. There were 123 people living at Pipalyatjara in the 2006 census. The residents are mainly indigenous people who speak Pitjantjatjara as their first language. There is a small airstrip at Pipalyatjara. Mail is delivered once per week by air. There is also a small health facility staffed by nurses; a doctor visits from Kaltjiti. Electricity comes from a diesel generator. Water comes from two bores and placed in storage tanks for pumping to the community. There is a school in Pipalyatjara, which also serves nearby Kalka. ==References== ==Other websites== *Description from PY Media *Pipalyatjara School Website Category:Towns in South Australia Category:Indigenous Australian communities Category:Pitjantjatjara",
