He worked to protect and promote Rajasthani folk dances like Ghoomar, Kalbelia, Chang, and Bhawai. ==Early life== Harish Kumar was born in 1979 in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, to a family of carpenters from the Suthar community. He started dancing at age 13. After his parents died young, he began drag dancing to support his sisters. Harish said, > “I am a man, who chooses to dance for a living. That's a reality that I will > never ignore. I chose to make the Queen part more regal and not comical.” Inspired by 'Annu Master,' who performed the first drag dance in Jaisalmer, Harish learned from him. He also practiced American tribal style belly dancing and pole dancing to master feminine movements. ==Career== Harish performed Rajasthani dances like Ghoomar, Kalbelia, Chang, Bhawai, and Chari in over 60 countries. He taught choreography to more than 2,000 students in Japan. His performances were highlights at events like the Jaipur Literary Mela, the Raqs Congress in Brussels, the Belly Dancing Festival in Seoul, and Desilicious in New York City. In 2010, he was a semi-finalist on the reality TV show 'India's Got Talent.' He appeared in Bollywood movies like Upadapdu (2003), Jai Gangajal (2016), and The Accidental Prime Minister (2019). In 2007, he featured in Jasmine Dellal's documentary When the Road Bends… Tales of a Gypsy Caravan. He ran a daily show called Queen Harish Program in Jaisalmer, in collaboration with the Rajasthan government, and was invited to perform at Isha Ambani's pre-wedding celebrations in December 2018. ==Personal life== Harish was married and had two sons. He died in a road accident on 2 June 2019 while traveling from Jaisalmer to Ajmer. Three other artists also died in the accident. The Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot, said, > “Harish gave a new identity to Jaisalmer with his different dance style. His > death is a big loss to the field of folk art.” ==References== Category:1979 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Folk dance Category:Indian dancers Category:People from Rajasthan",
