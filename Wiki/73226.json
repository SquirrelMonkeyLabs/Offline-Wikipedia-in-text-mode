 "text": "A Fermat number is a special positive number. Fermat numbers are named after Pierre de Fermat. The formula that generates them is :F_{n} = 2^{2^{ \\overset{n} {}}} + 1 where n is a nonnegative integer. The first nine Fermat numbers are : :F0 = 21 \\+ 1 = 3 :F1 = 22 \\+ 1 = 5 :F2 = 24 \\+ 1 = 17 :F3 = 28 \\+ 1 = 257 :F4 = 216 \\+ 1 = 65537 :F5 = 232 \\+ 1 = 4294967297 = 641 × 6700417 :F6 = 264 \\+ 1 = 18446744073709551617 = 274177 × 67280421310721 :F7 = 2128 \\+ 1 = 340282366920938463463374607431768211457 = 59649589127497217 × 5704689200685129054721 :F8 = 2256 \\+ 1 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639937 = 1238926361552897 × 93461639715357977769163558199606896584051237541638188580280321 As of 2007, only the first 12 Fermat numbers have been completely factored. (written as a product of prime numbers) These factorizations can be found at Prime Factors of Fermat Numbers. If 2n \\+ 1 is prime, and n > 0, it can be shown that n must be a power of two. Every prime of the form 2n \\+ 1 is a Fermat number, and such primes are called Fermat primes. The only known Fermat primes are F0,...,F4. == Interesting things about Fermat numbers == *No two Fermat numbers have common divisors. *Fermat numbers can be calculated recursively: To get the Nth number, multiply all Fermat numbers before it, and add two to the result. == What they are used for == Today, Fermat numbers can be used to generate random numbers, between 0 and some value N, which is a power of 2. == Fermat's conjecture == Fermat, when he was studying these numbers, conjectured that all Fermat numbers were prime. This was proven to be wrong by Leonhard Euler, who factorised F_5 in 1732. == Other websites == * Sequence of Fermat numbers * Prime Glossary Page on Fermat Numbers * Generalized Fermat Prime search * History of Fermat Numbers * Unification of Mersenne and Fermat Numbers * Prime Factors of Fermat Numbers * Fermat Number at MathWorld * Distributed Search for Fermat Number Divisors Category:Number theory Category:Integer sequences",
