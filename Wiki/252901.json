 "text": "The Leader of the Opposition in New Zealand is the politician who leads the MPs that are not in government in the New Zealand Parliament. In the debating chamber the Leader of the Opposition sits directly opposite the Prime Minister. At present, the Leader of the Opposition is Chris Hipkins of Labour since 2023. ==Role== Usually, the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the largest party of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition does not have a large official role, but there are several ways in which the Leader of the Opposition takes part in affairs of state. Often, these relate to national security matters, which are supposed to go past party politics - the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, for example, has to talk to the Leader of the Opposition as well as the Prime Minister about certain matters. The Leader of the Opposition also receives a higher salary than other members of the Opposition, being paid the same amount as a Cabinet Minister. ==References== Category:Politics of New Zealand",
