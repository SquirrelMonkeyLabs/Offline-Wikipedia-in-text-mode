Chaplin plays the Little Tramp. It was a character he created. The Little Tramp appeared in many Chaplin movies. In this movie, the Little Tramp has many adventures with other prospectors. He falls in love with a saloon girl. Critics liked the movie. One critic wrote, \"Here is a comedy with streaks of poetry, pathos, tenderness, linked with brusqueness and boisterousness. It is the outstanding gem of all Chaplin's pictures, as it has more thought and originality than even such masterpieces of mirth as The Kid and Shoulder Arms.\" In 1992 The Gold Rush was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Chaplin hoped that people would remember him for this movie. == References == == Other websites == * * * * The Greatest Films: The Gold Rush * Bibliography Category:American silent movies Category:1925 comedy movies Category:American comedy movies Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:Gold Category:Movies directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:Movies set in the 1890s Category:Movies set in Alaska Category:Movies set in Yukon",
