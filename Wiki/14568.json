 "text": "A Köbes (pronounced like 'kur-bess') is a waiter in traditional pubs in the Rhineland part of Germany, especially in Cologne, Düsseldorf and Krefeld. A Köbes wears a blue apron and blue jacket and has a big leather belt with a leather purse. He serves beer and food to guests and replaces empty beer glasses with full ones until the customer either places a beermat on his glass to signal that he does not want any more, or until the customer asks to pay. The word Köbes comes from the name Jakob in a local dialect. == Books == * Michael Scuffil: Drink doch ene mit!
