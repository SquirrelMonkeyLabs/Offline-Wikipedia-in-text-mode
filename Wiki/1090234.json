 "text": "Afghan refugees are people from Afghanistan who had flee their country as a result of war or persecution. In 1978, the Saur Revolution occurred followed by the 1979 Soviet invasion which made a wave of refugee migration to neighboring Iran and Pakistan, as well as internationally from there. Due to decades of continuous civil war, over 6 million Afghan refugees were living in Iran and Pakistan by 2000. Most refugees returned to Afghanistan following the 2001 United States invasion and the end of the Taliban regime. However after 2021 when the Taliban came back to power, a number started to leave the country while others returned to Afghanistan. ==References== Category:Afghan people",
