It took in 1921 the name of \"Communist Party\". In 1936, it was a part of the Popular Front and supported its social reforms, but refused to participate in the government. During the Second World War, the PCF became a clandestine organisation and organised a massive armed resistance against the Nazi occupation. At the Liberation, the party was the most important in France and had several ministers in the Provisional Government.

From the 1930s to the 1980s, the French Communist Party's line is close to the Soviet Union's. The collapse of the USSR in 1991 also affects the PCF, whose electoral support decreases rapidly. == Electoral results == At the French 2007 legislative election, the PCF gained 4.29% of the votes, Official results of the French 2007 legislative election , Ministry of the Interior. one of its worst results. However, the Communist party is still one of the most important party in some regions of France (Seine-Saint-Denis, Nord...), where it has been historically strong.
