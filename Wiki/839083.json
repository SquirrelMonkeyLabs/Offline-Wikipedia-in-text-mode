 "text": "Démuin is a commune. It is in Hauts-de-France in the Somme department in north France. Most of the soil and subsoil in the area is made up of slopes with white or marly chalk. In the south and southeast, there are clay layers forming the plateau loam, sometimes mixed with flint. The soil in the Luce Valley is made up of peaty alluvial deposits. The land is a plateau with valleys cutting through it—one is the Luce Valley running east to west, and another is a dry valley running south to north. The highest point of the plateau is 104 meters, gently sloping down toward the Luce Valley. == References == Category:Communes in Somme",
