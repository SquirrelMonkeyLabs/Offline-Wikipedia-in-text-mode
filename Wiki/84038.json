 "text": "The 1991 Halloween Nor’easter, also known as the Perfect Storm, was an atypical nor’easter which was extratropical, absorbed one hurricane, and ultimately evolved into a small hurricane late in its life cycle. The unnamed hurricane of 1991 was the last tropical cyclone of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season, and its hurricane. By November 2, Atlantic Canada experienced the effects of a landfalling tropical storm. Damage totaled $208 million (1991 USD)http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/satellite/satelliteseye/cyclones/pfctstorm91/pfctstdam.html and deaths climbed to 12 people. Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical. The hurricane was the second costliest storm of the season, behind only Hurricane Bob. ==References== Category:Tropical cyclones in North America Category:Hurricanes in the United States Halloween Nor'easter Halloween Nor'easter Halloween Nor'easter Halloween Nor'easter",
