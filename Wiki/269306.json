 "text": "Norman Steven Maciver (born September 1, 1964 in Thunder Bay, Ontario) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League as a member of the New York Rangers, Hartford Whalers, Edmonton Oilers, Ottawa Senators, Pittsburgh Penguins, and the Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes franchise. == Career == MacIver was never drafted by an NHL franchise and instead took the university route in order to reach the NHL. The defenceman played four seasons with the University of Minnesota Duluth and in 1985-86 was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, awarded to the NCAA's top player. While playing at the University of Minnesota, MacIver earned a communications degree and signed as a free agent with the NHL's New York Rangers upon graduation. He played 500 regular season games in the NHL, scoring 55 goals and 230 assists for 285 points and collecting 350 penalty minutes. A career highlight came during the Ottawa Senators' debut season of 1992-93, when Maciver led the team in scoring with 17 goals and 46 assists for 63 points in 80 games. In the spring of 1996, he scored the final goal in Winnipeg Jets' history prior to the team's relocation to Phoenix in the sixth game of a first round playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings. After retirement he became an assistant coach for the American Hockey League's Springfield Falcons from 2000 to 2003, and then the NHL's Boston Bruins from 2003 to 2006. Maciver is currently an amateur scout with the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks. ==Other websites== * * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Binghamton Whalers players Category:Canadian ice hockey centres Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Cape Breton Oilers players Category:Edmonton Oilers players Category:Hartford Whalers players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:New Haven Nighthawks players Category:New York Rangers players Category:Ottawa Senators players Category:Sportspeople from Thunder Bay Category:Phoenix Coyotes players Category:Pittsburgh Penguins players Category:Winnipeg Jets (1979–96) players Category:International Hockey League (1945–2001) players",
