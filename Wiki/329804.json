 "text": "Moonshine (also called white lightning, mountain dew, hooch, \"Tennessee white whiskey\", and many other names) is an alcoholic drink that is made illegally. But is usually hidden well from the law. == In movies == In 1958 Robert Mitchum made a film \"Thunder Road\" about a moonshine \"runner\" who makes one last-and fatal run. The part of the \"runner\" being killed was loosely based on the death of a actual runner named Rufus Gunther of Cocke County Tennessee in January 1953 The movie part of the burning car going over the cliff was reused in the 1963 Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Bouncing Boomerang\" ==References== Category:Alcoholic drinks Category:Illegal drugs",
