It was the capital of the former Demmin Rural District. == World War II == German troops destroyed the bridges over the Peene while retreating from Demmin during World War II. This way, the advance of the Soviet Red Army was slowed down when they arrived in Demmin on April 30, 1945. During that night and the following morning, Demmin was handed over to the Red Army largely without fighting, similar to other cities like Greifswald. Although there were only a few pockets of resistance, nearly 900 people committed mass suicides in fear of the Red Army.
