The team was rebranded as Stake F1 Team with a constructor name of Kick Sauber. AlphaTauri rebranded as RB, with an identical constructor name. The aerodynamics operations of the team were relocated to Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom amidst a management restructure. ==== Driver changes ==== The only change from the drivers contracted at the beginning of 2023 occurred at the former AlphaTauri team, who replaced Nyck de Vries with Daniel Ricciardo from the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix onwards. This means that all driver and team combinations that competed in the final round of the previous season are set to remain unchanged for the start of the next season for the first time in Formula One World Championship history. ==== Mid-season ==== Carlos Sainz Jr. was forced to withdraw from the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after he was diagnosed with appendicitis. He was replaced by Ferrari reserve and Formula 2 driver Oliver Bearman, who made his Formula One debut. Sainz returned at the following Australian Grand Prix. From the Italian Grand Prix onwards, Formula 2 driver Franco Colapinto replaced Logan Sargeant at Williams, making his Formula One debut. Kevin Magnussen of Haas received two penalty points for causing a collision at the Italian Grand Prix, taking his total to twelve penalty points in twelve months, and triggering an automatic race ban for the following Azerbaijan Grand Prix. He is scheduled to be replaced by Bearman, who will race for the second time in the season as a reserve driver. Magnussen is permitted to return at the subsequent Singapore Grand Prix. Daniel Ricciardo was dropped from RB ahead of the United States Grand Prix. He was replaced by the reserve driver Liam Lawson, who drove in the 2023 season in place of the injured Ricciardo at the same team, then known as AlphaTauri. == Calendar == The 2024 calendar is scheduled to contain twenty-four Grands Prix. The provisional 2024 Formula One World Championship Calendar was released on 5 July 2023.
