Raisi's head of security, a bodyguard, and three members of flight crew. The crash happened near Jolfa in East Azerbaijan, close to the Azerbaijan–Iran border. Rescuers had trouble because of the dense forest, heavy rain, fog, and strong winds. Drones, search teams, trained dogs, and a satellite system helped with the search. Funeral services began on 21 May. Raisi was the second president of Iran to have died in office, following Mohammad-Ali Rajai, who died in a bombing in 1981. After President Raisi died in the crash, Mohammad Mokhber became the acting president of Iran. == Background == On 19 May 2024, President of Iran Ebrahim Raisi and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev met in Azerbaijan to open two hydroelectric complexes, Khoda Afarin and Giz Galasi. These are the third joint projects between the two countries on the Aras River. A day before the crash, the Iran Meteorological Organization issued an orange weather warning (severe weather that may cause damage or accidents) for the region. == Accident == === Flight === After the complex was inaugurated, a helicopter carrying Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Governor-General of East Azerbaijan Malek Rahmati, and the Supreme Leader's Representative in East Azerbaijan Mohammad Ali Ale-Hashem as well as Sardar Seyed Mehdi Mousavi, head of Raisi’s security team, two military pilots holding the rank of colonel and a flight technician with the rank of major left for Tabriz with two other helicopters. Around 13:30 IRST (UTC+03:30), the helicopter crashed shortly after an emergency call was made. Energy Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian and Housing and Transportation Minister Mehrdad Bazrpash, in the other helicopters, arrived safely in Tabriz. === Crash === The helicopter crashed around south west of the village of Uzi. The crash site was in the Dizmar Forest, a wildlife area near the northern Varzaqan area of East Azerbaijan province, killing everyone on board including the Iranian president. Later on 19 May, the IRIB reported the helicopter had been found and that there was \"no sign of life\" at the crash scene. The helicopter had been completely burned after the crash. Search operations ended following the recovery of the bodies of those on board on 20 May. Many of the bodies found were burnt, but were still identifiable visually. == Funerals == Funerals for the victims began on 21 May in Tabriz, with a large crowd attending. The remains were moved to Tehran, then to Qom, and back to Tehran University for another ceremony on 22 May, attended by Khamenei, Mokhber, and foreign dignitaries like Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. Afterward, the remains were taken to Azadi Square, where people chanted \"Death to America\". Government offices and private businesses were closed on 22 May. The next day, Raisi's remains will go to Birjand and then to Mashhad for burial at the Imam Reza shrine. ==Reactions== Maryam Rajavi, the leader of a political group in exile, People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, said that the crash is a blow to \"Ali Khamenei and the\" regime. She added that Raisi's legacy was marked by his role in the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners. == References == Category:2020s disasters in Iran Varzaqan helicopter crash Category:May 2024 events Category:2024 Varzaqan helicopter crash",
