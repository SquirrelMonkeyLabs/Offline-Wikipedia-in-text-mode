 "text": "David Américo Ortiz Arias, also went by David Arias, (born November 18, 1975 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic) is a former Major League Baseball designated hitter who played for the Boston Red Sox. Ortiz used to play for the Minnesota Twins from -. Nicknamed \"Big Papi\" or \"Señor Papi\", Ortiz has played in four All-Star Games. He holds the Red Sox single-season record for home runs with 54, which he set during the 2006 season. He also won the 2010 Home Run Derby ==Early career== Ortiz graduated from Estudia Espaillat High School in the Dominican Republic. In 1992, he was signed by the Seattle Mariners who listed him as \"David Arias\" (possibly not understanding Spanish naming customs). In 1996, the Mariners received Dave Hollins from the Minnesota Twins for a player to be named later. Later that season, the Mariners announced that the player to be named later would be Arias. When Ortiz arrived in Minnesota, he informed the team that he preferred to be listed as \"David Ortiz.\" He made his major league debut in September of 1997. After moving up and down from the majors to the minors, Ortiz hit .272 with 20 home runs and 75 RBI in 2002, when the Twins lost in the American League Championship Series to the eventual World Series champions Anaheim Angels. ==Professional career== In 2003, Ortiz was traded to the Boston Red Sox. He hit 31 home runs that season. The Red Sox lost to the New York Yankees in the ALCS. Starting in 2004, however, Ortiz became known for his clutch hitting. He hit two walk-off home runs in the postseason. His first came when the Red Sox swept the Anaheim Angels in the American League Division Series. He hit another walk-off home run in Game 4 of the ALCS against the Yankees. And he also had a walk-off single in Game 5. He was named ALCS MVP. The Red Sox went on to win their first World Series since 1918. They won three more World Series championships in 2007, 2013, and 2018 (the latter which was won after Ortiz retired). In Game 2 of the 2013 ALCS against the Detroit Tigers, Ortiz hit a game-tying grand slam with two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning. Ortiz retired after the 2016 season. The Red Sox were swept by the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS that year. ==2019 shooting== On June 9, 2019, Ortiz was shot in the Dominican Republic while at a club in Santo Domingo. Ortiz was \"ambushed by a man who got off a motorcycle\" and shot him in the back. He was hospitalized and underwent surgery. ==Career statistics== year team G AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI SB BB SO BA OBP SLG 1997 MIN 15 49 10 16 3 0 1 6 0 2 19 .327 .353 .449 1998 MIN 86 278 47 77 20 0 9 46 1 39 72 .277 .371 .446 1999 MIN 10 20 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 12 .000 .200 .000 2000 MIN 130 415 59 117 36 1 10 63 1 57 81 .282 .364 .446 2001 MIN 89 303 46 71 17 1 18 48 1 40 68 .234 .324 .475 2002 MIN 125 412 52 112 32 1 20 75 1 43 87 .272 .339 .500 2003 BOS 128 448 79 129 39 2 31 101 0 58 83 .288 .369 .592 2004 BOS 150 582 94 175 47 3 41 139 0 75 133 .301 .380 .603 2005 BOS 159 601 119 180 40 1 47 148 1 102 124 .300 .397 .604 2006 BOS 151 558 115 160 29 2 54 137 1 119 117 .287 .413 .636 2007 BOS 149 549 116 182 52 1 35 117 3 111 103 .332 .445 .621 2008 BOS 49 103 40 52 9 0 13 43 0 31 33 .250 .358 .488 Total - 1234 4378 772 1262 324 12 573 923 9 676 918 .288 .383 .556 ==References== == Other websites == * Fan-driven, Red Sox social media site * Ten Questions for David Ortiz on Time.com (a division of Time Magazine) * Stephan and Big Papi * David Ortiz Interview * Stephan and Big Papi Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Dominican Republic baseball players Category:Minnesota Twins players",
