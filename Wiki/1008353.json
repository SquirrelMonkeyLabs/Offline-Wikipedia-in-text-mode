 "text": "The Chinese whipping frog or Chenfu's tree frog (Zhangixalus chenfui) is a frog. It lives in China. People have seen it between 900 and 3000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in small streams, paddy fields, and other places where there is water. It lives in places near water, like forests and shrub places on hills. This frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole. This frog lives in many protected parks. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but there are fewer of them because people change the places where it lives to build farms and other things that people need. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
