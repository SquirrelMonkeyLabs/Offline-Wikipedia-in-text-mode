 "text": "Novostav (until the 1940s — Yurydiko-Novostav) — a village in the Zoryanska village community of the Rivne district of the Rivne region of Ukraine. The population is 779 people. == Geography == The village is located one kilometer north of Klevan on the southern (partially northern) side of the railway near the already dried Stubla floodplain on both sides. Novostav has named objects: Dacha (Dachi) \"Sanatorna district\", where in 1924 the burgher Svishchuk built the first rest house in the purchased forest; Busli \"an inhabited riverbank, where storks and storks once gathered before departure\" and many others. == Name == The name Novostav comes from the two-component Novy Stav, which, in turn, was the result of distinguishing two Stavs: the older and the newer. The original Stav, which on the left bank of the Stubla took the name of the tract where it was, and apparently, somewhere in the vicinity of the former water mill, is now gone, as well as the stream of Zhivets (Zhylivets), which originated from spring waters. According to legend, Novostav got its name from the expression \"to build a new village\", because it is said that the surrounding villagers decided to create a new settlement here after the Tatar pogrom. But some tend to see in the name the concept of \"a settlement created at the new pond on the right bank of the Stubla\". == History == For the first time, Novostav, but under the name Novy Stav, is mentioned in a charter of 1516, where it is said that King Sigismund I granted Bohus an estate named \"Zhukovo\" with the villages of \"Belev\" and \"Novy Stav\". At that time, according to popular speech, there was still \"Stary Stav\", located on the left side of Stubla on the road to Olyshva in the vicinity of the sanatorium, Klevanska Secondary School. It was, obviously, the oldest settlement of Novostava, and now it is its precinct. In 1577, \"Novyi Stav\" as an estate of Ivan Czartoryiskyi paid Klevansky castle large in-kind duties from the apiary, pitch mill, grain grinding, fishing. Two years later, the \"Novostav bridge\" was mentioned, which was completely destroyed by the spring flood when the Stubelka overflowed. According to the \"lustration\" of 1579, \"Novostav\" held three \"gardens\" of the Lutsk castle. The act of 1588 confirms the ownership of \"New Stav\" to Yuri Czartoryiskyi as a castle settlement with preferential duties. At the end of 1603, an enterprise for the production of \"turpentine\", tar, resin was built in \"Novy Stav\" using foreign equipment. During the war of liberation, in 1652, \"Novostavetskoe estate\" was completely devastated. Great damage was done to him by new punitive noble units. Then a large part of the peasants went to the Pinsk swamps. According to data from 1779, Novostav is a \"village\" eparchically belonging to Klevan, which then had 89 yards and 789 inhabitants. A little later, \"Yuridiko-Novostav\" was formed - the northwestern outskirts of Klevan in the vicinity of the church. According to the 1947 directory, Jurydiko-Novostav, which had a village council, was renamed Novostav.
