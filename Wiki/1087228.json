 "text": "An empanada is a type of stuffed pastry from Spain, other Southern European countries, Latin American countries, and the Philippines. The name comes from the Spanish word empanar (which means \"to bread,\" i.e., \"to coat with bread\"). The word \"empanada\" translates as 'breaded', that is, wrapped or coated in bread. Empanadas are made by folding dough over a filling, which may consist of meat, cheese, tomato, corn, or other ingredients, and then cooking the resulting turnover, either by baking or frying.
