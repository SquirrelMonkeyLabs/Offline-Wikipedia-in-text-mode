 "text": "Bone marrow failure happens when someone's bone marrow makes a low amount of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. Red blood cells, with the hemoglobin, transport oxygen throughout the body via the bloodstream. White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. Bone marrow also has platelets, which trigger clotting, and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs. ==References== Category:Blood disorders",
