Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. George Stevens, Jr. was the first director of the organization. Jean Picker Firstenberg was the director from 1980 to 2007. Bob Gazzale is the current President and CEO. The AFI Conservatory trains new filmmakers. Even though its name only mentions film, AFI also works on television and video. In 1973, the AFI began handing out Life Achievement Awards. In 1998, when American cinema had existed for 100 years, AFI began its 100 Years Series, which helped people become interested in the history of movies.
