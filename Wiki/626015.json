Most Olivooides fossils are in a late embryonic stage, having died before hatching. Some show a hatched animal, conical with a star-shape surface, and stellae. They are pertural in the peak. There is an addition of striated tissue that indicates growth. ==References== Category:Jellyfish Category:Cambrian",
