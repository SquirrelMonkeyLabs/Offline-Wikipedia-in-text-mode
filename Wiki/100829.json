But do not include the Crimean Tatars.The Crimean Tatars: The Diaspora Experience and the Forging of a Nation by Brian Glyn WilliamsКрымские татары - Big Russian Encyclopedia Most Tatars live in Russia (forming the majority in Tatarstan), as well as in countries as Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Crimean Tatars live in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. Smaller minorities of Tatars live in Israel, France, Canada, Australia, the United States, Finland, and Japan. The Tatars mostly practice Sunni Islam. Their closest relatives are the Bashkirs, and they are also related to the Azerbaijanis, Kazakhs, Chuvash people, and the Turkish people. ==History== Historically, the word \"Tatar\" might have referred to the Tatar confederation, which eventually became part of the Mongol Empire when Genghis Khan joined the various Eurasian steppe tribes into one empire. The term \"Tatars\" was spelled as \"Tartars\" on occasion. In the past, this term was used to refer to anyone coming from North and Central Asia dominated by many predominantly Turco- Mongol empires and kingdoms. Neighbouring non-Turkic peoples called any Turkic-speaking people Tatar. Nowadays, this term is used to refer to certain Turkic peoples. Russian historian D. Iskhakov wrote in 2000: “the real history of Tatars, of the people in every respect historical, is not written yet”. However, a book by independent Tatar historian Galy Yenikeyev about the unwritten history of the Tatars claims to have new facts. ==Sources==",
