Munishi, Pg 15-16 : Chandragupta drove out the Greeks from the Punjab in a brilliant war of liberation. The successful war against the Greeks awoke Chandragupta (c.324-300 B.C.) to a consciousness of his strength. ... Consolidating his position in the Punjab, and inspired by his teacher Chanakya, Chandragupta marched on Pataliputra; killed Dhana Nanda, assumed the sovereignty of Magadha; vanquished Seleucus, the Greek, who was moving towards India to recapture Alexanderâ€™s lost possessions; and started on a career of becoming the architect of an all-India empire. == Background == The Indian campaign of Alexander the Great ended before Chandragupta Maurya came into power. Alexander had left India in 325 BCE and assigned the northwestern Indian subcontinent territories to Greek governors. == The campaigns == After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Chandragupta Maurya led a series of campaigns in 305 BCE to take satrapies in the Indus Valley and northwest India. The nature of early relationship between these governors and Chandragupta Maurya is unknown. Justin mentions Chandragupta as a rival of the Alexander's successors in north-western India. He states that after Alexander's death, Chandragupta Maurya freed Indian territories from the Greeks and executed some of the governors. According to Boesche, this war with the northwestern territories was in part fought by mercenaries hired by Chandragupta and Chanakya, and these wars may have been the cause of the demise of two of Alexander's governors, Nicanor and Philip. ==Sources== ===References=== Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:Conflicts Category:4th century BC Category:Ancient India Category:Wars involving India",
