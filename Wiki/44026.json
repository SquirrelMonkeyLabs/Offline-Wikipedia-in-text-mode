 "text": "Liopleurodon was a large species of Pliosaur. It was an apex predator in the Upper Jurassic seas, around 160â€“155 million years ago. It grew up to long. It was a relative of Pliosaurus and Kronosaurus. It preyed on other marine animals such as Ophthalmosaurus. Some fossil remains excavated from the Kimmeridge Clay formation in England indicate a much larger animal, perhaps up to long. However, these have not been put in the genus Liopleurodon. Liopleurodon's nose allowed it to smell underwater. It could smell prey from some distance away. Despite needing to breath air, Liopleurodon spent its entire life at sea and was unable to leave the water. Consequently, it would have given birth to its young alive and may have visited shallower water to breed. ==Species== * L. ferox (type) * L. pachydeirus * L. rossicus * L. macromerus == References == Category:Plesiosaurs",
