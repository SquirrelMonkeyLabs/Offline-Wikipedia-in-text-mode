 "text": "Filicide is the act of a parent killing his or her son or daughter. The word filicide comes from the Latin words filius meaning \"son\" or filia meaning \"daughter\" and the suffix -cide meaning \"to kill, murder or cause death\". Famous cases of filicides include Peter the Great, who had his son Alexei tortured and killed; Wu Zetian, who is said to have killed her own daughter to frame her lover's wife; and Susan Smith, who murdered her two sons.Spitz, D.J.
