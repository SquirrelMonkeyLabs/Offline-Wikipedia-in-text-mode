The Ruhr river runs through the center of Schwerte. Schwerte is a popular cycling destination for tourists. ==History== Schwerte received civic rights in the 12th century. It was a member of the medieval Hanseatic League. During World War II Schwerte housed a branch of the Buchenwald concentration camp. The camp held 710 prisoners. == Controversy == In 2015 Schwerte officials have proposed housing refugees at the site of the former concentration camp. The plan has been criticized as a bad idea by many Germans including the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia. Officials say the buildings were built after the war and should not be a problem. Refugees coming to Germany include those from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Kosovo and Serbia. == References == ==Other websites== * Official site * Heimatverein Ergste Internet site of the local history society of Ergste Category:Urban districts in Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg Category:Unna (district)",
