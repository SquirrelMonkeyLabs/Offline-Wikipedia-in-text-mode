 "text": "The Romance languages (also sometimes called Latin languages or Neo-Latin languages) are a language family in the Indo-European languages. They started from Vulgar Latin (in Latin, vulgar is the word for \"common\" and so \"Vulgar Latin\" means \"Common Latin\"). The most spoken Romance languages are Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian. They are called \"Romance languages\" because they originate from Latin, the language spoken by the Western Roman Empire. Their grammatical inflection system has been simplified with the loss of most of the complex case structure of Classical Latin. The area that the Romance languages are spoken in Europe mostly was in the Western Roman Empire. The Greek language superseded Latin in the Eastern Roman Empire. Latin survived in Romania, whose language, Romanian, is a Romance language. In Moldova, it is sometimes called Moldovan. == Demographics == The Romance language family is one of the largest in the world have a total of almost a billion first- and second-language speakers.
