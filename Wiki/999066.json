Thatcher plays the drums. The band has made three albums: Royal Blood (2014), How Did We Get So Dark? (2017), and Typhoons (2021). The band was made in 2011. It was made when Kerr met Matt Swan. Swan was the band's first drummer. At this time, the band had Joe Dennis playing the guitar. Dennis left the band in 2012. Because of this, Kerr started playing the bass guitar in many different ways. He used different effect pedals to make his bass guitar sound similar to an electric guitar. The band played music in Australia, but Kerr went back to Worthing. Ben Thatcher replaced Swan. Thatcher and Kerr continued making music. == References == Category:Musical groups established in 2011 Category:English rock bands Category:Musical duos",
