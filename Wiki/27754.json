 "text": "John Caldwell Calhoun (March 18, 1782 â€“ March 31, 1850) was the vice president of the United States for John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. Calhoun was the vice president under two different presidents; the only other to do so was George Clinton. Calhoun's father was an Irish immigrant. Calhoun is probably best remembered for his strong beliefs in slavery and nullification, which states any state has the right to reject a federal law if it is unconstitutional. President Jackson hated nullification, and the disagreement started a feud between them. Calhoun was the first vice president in US history to resign from office on December 28, 1832. In 1844 and 1845, he was United States Secretary of State. ==References== == Other websites == * John C.
