Outdoor locations were filmed in Pitt Town and Oakville, in the northwestern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. Several of the regular cast members became popular celebrities as a result of their roles in the series. It also featured many native Australian animals, particularly the iconic 'Fatso the wombat' adding to its appeal both nationally and internationally. After the series was cancelled by the Seven Network in 1993, the series was relaunched on the Network Ten in 1994. At the time of its cancellation, A Country Practice was the longest-running Australian TV drama. However, by the late 1990s, the record was overtaken by Network Ten series Neighbours. The series was eventually sold and aired in 48 countries. ==Cast== ===Main cast (Seven Network series) 1981-1993=== NOTE: Actors highlighted in pink were original cast members.
