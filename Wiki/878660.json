In a 2015 interview with Oyebade Dosunmu for Aké Review, Wood said: \"Even long before my UK days I had lived in Northern and South-Western Nigeria as well as Los Angeles— all by the age of eleven or twelve. There is a sense in which you’re always out of time, out of place—and the years in Britain merely compounded that. The feeling doesn’t go away with return to Nigeria, it merely mutates, as people remark about me coming across as someone from ‘away’, even when I’m trying to blend in. I am therefore pretty sensitive to the permutations of dislocation and re-integration. London was a huge tableau for me to observe this theatre of human experience as far as Nigerian immigrants were concerned.\"Oyebade Dosunmu, \"Peripatetic Lives: An Interview with Molara Wood, Author of Indigo\" (interview), Aké Review, 30 November 2015. == Career == She was described as \"one of the eminent voices in the Arts in Nigeria\".Oyebade Dosunmu, \"Peripatetic Lives: An Interview with Molara Wood, Author of Indigo\" (interview), Aké Review, 30 November 2015.

As Oyebade Dosunmu writes: \"Wood tells stories of people who inhabit in between ‘indigo’ spaces: the borderland of immigration, the no-man's-land of multiculturalism and the frontiers of social mobility. These worlds spiral into one another and their inhabitants spin along, negotiating extremes of human circumstance—barrenness, the (fated) pursuit of glamour, madness, death—struggling, all the while, to plant roots in shifting sand.\"Oyebade Dosunmu, \"Peripatetic Lives: An Interview with Molara Wood, Author of Indigo\" (interview), Aké Review, 30 November 2015. Many of the stories dealt with the lives of African women negotiating concerns such as barrenness, polygamy and widowhood. Wood has said that \"these are the writings of a womanist and a feminist. I have a great empathy, a well of feeling for what women go through. I don’t feel these are given adequate treatment in the writings of male writers, so it’s really up to us, the female writers, to privilege the voices and experiences of women.\" Wood was a judge for the 2015 Etisalat Prize for Literature.Judges , Etisalat Prize for Literature.
