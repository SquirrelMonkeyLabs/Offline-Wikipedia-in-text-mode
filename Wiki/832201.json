 "text": "The Downs Link is a 59.1km path linking the North Downs to the South Downs through the counties of Surrey & Sussex in South East England. The path can be used by pedestrians, bicyclists and horse riders. == Route & History == Most of the path follows two abandon railways, the Cranleigh Line and the Steyning Line. These railways were closed in the 1960s in the Beeching Axe. The former railways were purchased by the local councils in 1974 where the routes could be used by the public for walking. In 1984 the local authorities worked together and established a 48km long path. The path has been extended over time and now is a continuous 59km route with only a few sections using residential streets. Category:Sussex",
