 "text": "Lies for the Liars is a full-length album released in 2007 by The Used. ==Track listing== * All songs written by The Used. # \"The Ripper\" – 2:56 # \"Pretty Handsome Awkward\" – 3:32 # \"The Bird and the Worm\" – 3:46 # \"Earthquake\" – 3:29 # \"Hospital\" – 2:57 # \"Paralyzed\" – 3:13 # \"With Me Tonight\" – 3:06 # \"Wake the Dead\" – 4:14 # \"Find a Way\" – 3:23 # \"Liar Liar (Burn in Hell)\" – 2:52 # \"Smother Me\" – 4:20 ===Hidden track=== \"Smother Me\" ends at 4:20 but runs to 6:17 due to the addition of a hidden track titled \"Queso\". \"Queso\" is a 30 second song that is about a quesadilla. Though it was first released on The Used's MySpace in late 2006, most fans talked about it on message boards and thought of it as a joke - it was not expected to actually be on the album. ==The music== Lies for the Liars contains emotive, heartfelt and sometimes sarcastic or Gothic lyrics. It has more swearing than previous The Used albums, but this is used on fewer songs. For example, \"Liar Liar (Burn in Hell)\" swears 10 times. The first song \"The Ripper\" has an ending that makes the CD appear to be stuck, but its only part of the song. Category:2007 albums Category:Reprise Records albums",
