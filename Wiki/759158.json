The case was a 43-year-old man from Baƒçka Topola who had travelled to Budapest. As of 12 May 2020, 151,304 individuals were tested of which there have been 10,243 confirmed cases, 3,600 recoveries and 220 deaths in Serbia. ==Response== On 15 March 15, a state of emergency was declared. Many argue the declaration was against the constitution, because there was no debate among the MPs in the Serbian Parliament. All schools, Kindergarten and universities were closed. The following day, a curfew from (20:00h) to (05:00) was created across the whole country. In addition, people of the age of 65 and above have been forbidden to leave the house. On 20 March, cafe bars, shopping malls, public transportation were all closed. Food delivery, however, was allowed. ==References== Category:21st century in Serbia Serbia",
