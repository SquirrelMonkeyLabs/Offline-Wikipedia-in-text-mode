Located in the municipality of Cavinti, in the province of Laguna, the falls is one of the major tourist attractions of the region. The three-drop waterfall is reached by a river trip on dugout canoe, starting from the municipality of Pagsanjan.Peters, Jens (2005). \"Philippines Travel Guide, 2nd edition\", p.255-256.

Inc., Manila. ==Shooting the rapids== The bangkeros (boatmen) of Pagsanjan are traditional tour guides who steer their bancas (boats) along the river from their town of Pagsanjan upstream to the falls — but the falls are actually in the neighboring Cavinti municipality. The journey takes passengers through the narrow and verdant Pagsanjan Gorge lined with huge boulders, rocks, and small waterfalls. The ride upstream ends in a natural pool below the falls where an optional raft ride takes visitors through the cascading water to the Devil's Cave behind the falls. The return trip is a thrill ride through fourteen rapids, described locally as \"Shooting the Rapids\", as the skilled boatmen maneuver their boats through the narrow rocks as they race downstream.\"Shooting the rapids\" .

Originally called Pinágsangahán (\"branching\" or \"juncture\"), this was shortened to \"Pagsanjan\" by early Spanish colonists because they found the name very difficult to pronounce. ==Protected area== The falls and gorge were declared a National Park with Proclamation 392 on March 29, 1939, and Proc. 1551 on March 31, 1976.
