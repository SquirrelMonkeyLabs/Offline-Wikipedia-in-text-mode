The show was about the Jeffersons maid, Florence Johnston taking a new job as the leader of the housekeepers at a St. Frederick Hotel in New York City. The show follows Florence on her adventures with her other workers, Lyle Block, her annoying manager; Elena Beltran, her helper; Earl Bellamy, the house detective who cannot do his job; Hank Sabatino, the crazy handyman; Betty, the floor supervisor; Dennis, the bellboy; and Mr. Claymore, the hotel owner. ==Cast== * Marla Gibbs as Florence Johnston * Larry Linville as Lyle Block * Ruth Brown as Betty * Patrick Collins as Earl Bellamy * Robert Costanzo as Hank Sabatino * Jordan Gibbs as Dennis * Liz Torres as Elena Beltran * John Anderson as Mr. Claymore ==Episodes== ==Reception== Checking In was first on CBS on April 9, 1981, and lasted for only four episodes in the Thursday, 8:00 p.m. EST time. The show had low ratings, and was cancelled, with the final episode airing on April 30, 1981. Gibbs then returned to her regular role on The Jeffersons and it was said that the St. Frederick Hotel had burned down. Checking In was the first All in the Family spin-off show that did not do good, which was different from The Jeffersons, Maude and Maude spin-off Good Times. More tries to do spin-offs after Checking In were also not good like (Gloria in the 1982-1983 season and 704 Hauser in 1994). ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1981 television series debuts Category:1980s American black sitcoms Category:American television spin-offs Category:English-language television programs Category:Television series set in New York City",
