 "text": "The Livonian-Lithuanian Union (Latin: Unio Livoniae cum Magno Ducatu Lithuania, Latvia: Livonijas un Lietuvas reālūnija) was a political and administrative union formed between the Livonian Confederation and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on December 26, 1566. It was established under the Union of Grodno, during a period of political upheaval and conflicts in the Baltic region. The union made the Lithuanian Grand Duke the ruler of Livonia, creating a semi-autonomous Livonian Duchy under Lithuanian governance. == Historical background == Preceding Conflicts: The 16th century saw frequent wars between Livonia, Lithuania, and Muscovy (Russia). The Livonian Order, weakened by defeats in the Livonian War (1558–1583), sought alliances to protect itself. The earlier Treaty of Vilnius (1559) laid the groundwork for integrating Livonia into Lithuania's sphere of influence. Union of Grodno (1566): The union was finalized during the Seimas (assembly) of Grodno in 1566. Under this agreement, Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus of Lithuania became the ruler of Livonia, appointing Jan Hodekiewicz as its first governor. Livonia retained a degree of autonomy while aligning politically and militarily with Lithuania. == Governance and symbolism == * Coat of Arms: The union introduced a new emblem for the Livonian Duchy, featuring a silver griffin with a sword, symbolizing Livonia’s loyalty to Lithuania and its ruler, Sigismund II Augustus. * Administration: Livonia was governed by Lithuanian-appointed officials who managed its defense, economy, and foreign relations. However, Livonia faced challenges in unifying its various regions and maintaining stability. == Outcome and legacy == The Livonian-Lithuanian Union marked a turning point in Livonia's history, providing protection against Muscovy’s expansion while linking the region to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which would emerge in 1569. Despite its short-lived nature, the union contributed to the eventual integration of Livonia into the Commonwealth, shaping its political and cultural identity.
