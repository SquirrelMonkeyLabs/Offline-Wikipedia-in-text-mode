 "text": "NGC 6357 is a H II Region diffuse nebula near NGC 6334 in the constellation Scorpius. The nebula contains many proto stars that are protected by dark discs of gas. It also contains young stars wrapped in expanding \"cocoons\" or expanding gases surrounding these small stars. The nebula is also known as the Lobster Nebula. It was given the name War and Peace Nebula by the Midcourse Space Experiment scientists because of its look. In infrared images the bright, western part looks like a dove and the eastern part looks like a skull. Anime fans tried to get NASA to rename it as the Madokami nebula because it was like a character from the Madokami anime, The name was not changed. == Distance == The nebula is about 5,500 light years from Earth. == Associated open clusters == === Pismis 24 === This nebula includes the open cluster Pismis 24. There are many massive stars in this cluster. One of the brightest stars in the cluster i, Pismis 24-1, It was thought to be the most massive star on record. The star measures almost 300 solar masses. It was later learned that it was a multiple system of at least three stars. These three stars are each near 100 solar masses. This makes them among the more massive stars on record. === G353.2+0.7 === The young stellar cluster G353.2+0.7 lies at the east of Pismis 24. It was revealed by a Chandra X-ray image showing about 800 stars. === G353.1+0.6 === The young stellar cluster G353.1+0.6 lies at the southeast of Pismis 24. It has about 800 stars that were detected by X-ray. The region includes many O-type stars, including [BDSB2003] 10. == References == Category:Nebulae",
