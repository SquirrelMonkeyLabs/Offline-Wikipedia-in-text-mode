 "text": "India's cricket history began in the early 18th century with the arrival of the British East India Company. In 1721, sailors working for the Company were reported to be playing the game at Cambay, near Baroda. That is the earliest reference to cricket being played in the Indian sub-continent (including modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka). One of the players wrote: By the end of the century, the game had spread to other areas of the country. The Calcutta Cricket and Football Club is known to have been in existence by 1792. In 1799, another club was formed at Seringapatam in south India after the successful British siege, and the defeat of Tipu Sultan. ==References== Category:Cricket in India India",
