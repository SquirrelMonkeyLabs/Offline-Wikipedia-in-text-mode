 "text": "The Russian Republic, officially the Russian Democratic Federal Republic, was a short-lived state that existed from 1917 to 1918. It replaced the former Russian Empire, and was the last non-communist unified Russian nation before the beginning of the Russian Civil War. It was created by the Russian Provisional Government in 1917, another short-lived state that replaced the Russian Empire. While the Bolsheviks had removed the government of the Republic, there would be one more attempt to recreate the Russian Republic in 1918, which ended in the Bolsheviks once again removing the government, a day later. == History == After the February Revolution, Nicholas II resigned from the throne as Tsar of the Russian Empire, and a provisional government was formed. This provisional government was semi-democratic (with power split between the Bolsheviks and the provisional government), however had a very fragile government. In July 1917, the then leader of the Republic, Georgy Lvov resigned after not being able to gain the support of the Russian people. Lavr Kornilov gained control of the Republic, and created another provisional government. Bolshevik forces would remove the government in charge of the Republic in November 1917, but the government continued to de jure exist until January 1918. ==Notes== Category:History of Russia Category:States and territories disestablished in the 20th century Category:1917 establishments Category:1918 disestablishments",
