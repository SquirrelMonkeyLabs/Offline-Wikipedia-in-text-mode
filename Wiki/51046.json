It is at the western end of the island of Cuba. The Pinar del Río province has one of Cuba's three main mountain ranges, the Cordillera de Guaniguanico. The mountains are divided into the easterly Sierra del Rosario and the westerly Sierra de los Organos. These form a landscape characterised by steep sided limestone hills and flat, fertile valleys. The province relies on tobacco farming, with Pinar del Río producing 70% of Cuba's crop, used to make the cigars that are so prized overseas. The best tobacco, used for more expensive cigar brands, is grown in the flat lands of San Juan y Martínez. Tourism in the Viñales Valley is another important part of the economy. __TOC__ == Municipalities == * Bahía Honda * Candelaria * Consolación del Sur * Guane * La Palma * Los Palacios * Mantua * Minas de Matahambre * Pinar del Río * San Cristóbal * Sandino * San Juan y Martínez * San Luis * Viñales == Famous people from Pinar del Río == * Omar Ajete - baseball player * Danys Baez - baseball player * José Contreras - baseball player * Silvia Costa - high jumper * Emeterio González - javelin thrower * Pedro Luis Lazo - baseball player * Omar Linares - baseball player * Alay Soler - baseball player == Other websites == * Official site * Visit Hotel Pinar del Río * Villa Maria La Gorda * Villa Cabo San Antonio * Hotel Moka, Las Terrazas, Pinar del Río Category:Provinces of Cuba",
