Additionally, it identifies the federal role in supporting research, evaluation, technical assistance, and data collection activities; it established the Office on Child Abuse and Neglect in the United States Children's Bureau; and mandates the National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information. It also sets forth a minimum definition of child abuse and neglect.https://www.childwelfare.gov/resources/about-capta-legislative- history/ == Effectiveness == In 2018, Congress provided $85 million to states under the law, an amount that anti-abuse advocates criticized as too low, and which some states found too little to justify rigorous compliance, which would bring its own costs.https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house- bill/485 == References == ==Other Websites== *Child abuse prevention services",
