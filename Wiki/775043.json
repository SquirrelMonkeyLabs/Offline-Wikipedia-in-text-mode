 "text": "Colorado Amendment 36 was a popular initiative in the state of Colorado. Proposed in 2004, it proposed that instead of giving all its electoral votes to the winner of the state in presidential elections, it should base electoral vote allocation on voting proportionally (for example, if a candidate won 5/9 of the vote statewide, he would win 5/9 of the state's electoral votes), a unique system. It utlimately failed, getting only one-third of the vote. Category:History of Colorado",
