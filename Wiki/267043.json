 "text": "Geomorphology from , ge, \"earth\"; μορφή, morfé, \"form\"; and λόγος, logos, \"study\" is the scientific study of landforms and the processes that shape them. More broadly, it studies the evolution of the topography of a planet. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes. They use a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling. Geomorphology is part of geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology and archaeology. This range of interests leads to a wide variety of research styles and interests in the field. == References == Category:Earth sciences Category:subfields of geology Category:Branches of geography",
