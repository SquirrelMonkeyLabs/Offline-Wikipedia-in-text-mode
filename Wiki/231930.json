 "text": "William Charles \"Bill\" Ayers (born December 26, 1944) is an American elementary education theorist. He is a former head of the Weather Underground. Ayers is known for speaking out against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. He is also known for his current work in trying to help make learning and teaching better. In 1969, Ayers started the Weather Underground. The Weather Underground is a group that call themselves a \"communist revolutionary group\".The Weathermen's founding manifesto, signed by Ayers and ten others, says, \"The most important task for us toward making the revolution, and the work our collectives should engage in, is the creation of a mass revolutionary movement...akin to the Red Guard in China, based on the full participation and involvement of masses of people...with a full willingness to participate in the violent and illegal struggle. They carried out bombings against public buildings during the 1960s and 1970s. This was because the United States was being a part of the Vietnam War. Ayers is a professor in the College of Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has the titles of Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, a controversy was brought up over ties between Ayers and then Senator Barack Obama. Ayers is married to Bernadine Dohrn. She was also a member of the Weather Underground. == Early life == Bill Ayers grew up in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. Glen Ellyn is just outside Chicago. He went to public schools there until his second year of high school. After this he started going to Lake Forest Academy. It is a smaller prep school.Terry, Don (Chicago Tribune staff reporter), \"The calm after the storm\", Chicago Tribune Magazine, p 10, September 16, 2001, June 8, 2008 Ayers received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in American studies in 1968. He is the son of Thomas G. Ayers. His father used to be chairman and CEO of Commonwealth Edison. In 1965, Ayers was part of a group who were protesting at a restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The restaurant would not serve African Americans. Ayers' first arrest came when he took part in a sit-in at a local draft board. He sat in jail for ten days. Shortly after his arrest, he landed his first teaching job at the Children's Community School. This small preschool was run from a local church basement.Before \"going underground\" he published an account of this experience, Education: An American Problem. The preschool was part of a larger movement across the United States called the \"free school movement\". Schools that were part of this movement had no grades or report cards. Instead, they tried to work on getting students to cooperate with each other and work together instead of competing. The teachers allowed the students to call them by their first names. After teaching for only a few months, at the age of 21, Ayers became the head of the school. There he also met Diana Oughton, who would be his girlfriend until her death in an explosion in 1970. ==Beginnings with the Weathermen== Ayers became part of the New Left and the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in the early 1960s.Fugitive Days: A Memoir In 1968 and 1969, Ayers became well known as a head of the SDS. He was head of a smaller SDS group called the \"Jesse James Gang\". Ayers made important changes to Weatherman beliefs about being militant (ready to fight for the cause). The group that Ayers headed in Detroit, Michigan became one of the first groups that would turn into the Weathermen. Before the June 1969 SDS convention, Ayers became an important head of the group. This came about due to a split in the group. In June 1969, the Weathermen took over the SDS at its convention. Ayers was made Education Secretary.Barber, David, \"Fugitive Days; A Memoir - Book Review\", Journal of Social History, Winter 2002, retrieved June 10, 2008 Later in 1969, Ayers helped to place a bomb at a statue that was made to honor policemen that were killed.Jacobs, Ron, The way the wind blew: a history of the Weather Underground, London & New York: Verso, 1997. The bomb blast broke almost 100 windows and blew parts of the statue onto a nearby street. (The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4, 1970, and blown up again by other Weathermen on October 6, 1970.Adelman. Haymarket Revisited, p. 40. While they were putting it back together, the city put a 24-hour guard around it to stop another attack. In January 1972, it was moved to Chicago Police headquarters.Haymarket Memorial Statue Rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters Chicago Police Department, June 1, 2007 Ayers was also part of the Days of Rage riot that took place in Chicago in 1969. He was also a part of the \"War Council\" meeting that happened in Flint, Michigan. Two big decisions came from the \"War Council\". The first was to start a violent, armed resistance (using bombs, and robberies) against the government. The second was to start underground (secret) groups in important cities around the country.Good, \"Brian Flanagan Speaks,\" Next Left Notes, 2005. An FBI informant named Larry Grathwohl, who pretended to be a Weatherman in 1969, said that \"Ayers, along with Bernardine Dohrn, probably had the most authority within the Weatherman\".Grathwohl, Larry, and Frank, Reagan, Bringing Down America: An FBI Informant in with the Weathermen, Arlington House, 1977, page 110 == Years underground == In 1970, Weatherman members Ted Gold, Terry Robbins, and Diana Oughton were killed when a bomb they were building blew up. This was called the Greenwich Village town house explosion. Ayers and several other Weathermen were able to avoid being caught following this explosion. Ayers was not facing charges at this time, but the federal government later brought charges against him. Ayers was part of the bombings of New York City Police Department headquarters in 1970, the United States Capitol building in 1971, and the Pentagon in 1972. Ayers wrote, in 2001, that: > Although the bomb that rocked the Pentagon was itsy-bitsy - weighing close > to two pounds - it caused 'tens of thousands of dollars' of damage. The > operation cost under $500, and no one was killed or even hurt.Bill Ayers, > Fugitive Days, pg. 261 Some new reports have said that Ayers, Dohrn, or the Weatherman took part in the 1970 San Francisco Police Department bombing. However, neither Ayers, nor anyone else has ever been charged with this crime.USA Survival website - this is website of a political group opposed to Ayers, they have various pages devoted to the San Francisco bombing In 1973, it was discovered that the FBI were focusing on the Weatherman as well as the New Left. This was part of several secret, and sometimes illegal FBI projects called COINTEL. Because the FBI agents had broken the law, the government asked that all weapons and bomb charges be dropped against the Weather Underground. This included charges against Ayers.Jeremy Varon, Bringing The War Home: The Weather Underground, The Red Army Faction And Revolutionary Violence In The Sixties And Seventies, (Berkley: University of California Press, 2004), 297. However, there were still state charges against Dohrn. Dohrn did not want to turn herself in to the police. \"He was sweet and patient, as he always is, to let me come to my senses on my own\", she later said of Ayers. She finally turned herself in, in 1980. She was fined $1,500 and given three years probation.Susan Chira, At home with: Bernadine Dohrn; Same Passion, New Tactics, The New York Times, November 18, 1993 In 1973 Ayers helped write the book Prairie Fire with others who were part of the Weather Underground. They dedicated the book to almost 200 people, including Harriet Tubman, John Brown, 'All Who Continue to Fight', 'All Political Prisoners in the U.S.', and Sirhan Sirhan, who was convicted of killing Robert F. Kennedy.Blogspot.com, Dedication page, Prairie FireHarvey E. Klehr (1991) Far Left of Center: The American Radical Left Today, Transaction Publishers, p 108 ===Looking back on the underground period=== ====Fugitive Days: A Memoir==== In 2001, Ayers wrote Fugitive Days: A Memoir. He said Fugitive Days tried to answer the questions of Kathy Boudin's son and his statement that Diana Oughton died trying to stop the Greenwich Village bomb makers.Marcia Froelke Coburn, No Regrets, Chicago Magazine, August 2001 Some have questioned the truth, accuracy, and tone of the book. Brent Staples wrote for The New York Times Book Review that \"Ayers reminds us often that he can't tell everything without endangering people involved in the story.Staples, Brent, \"The Oldest Rad\", book review of Fugitive Days by Bill Ayers in New York Times Book Review, September 30, 2001, accessed June 5, 2008 Historian Jesse Lemisch (who was also a member of the SDS) said that Ayers' memories were wrong.Jesse Lemisch, Weather Underground Rises from the Ashes: They're Baack! , New Politics, Summer 2006 Ayers, in the beginning of his book, says that it was written as his personal memories and was not a research project.Dinitia Smith, No Regrets for a Love Of Explosives; In a Memoir of Sorts, a War Protester Talks of Life With the Weathermen, The New York Times, September 11, 2001 ====Statements made in 2001==== Chicago Magazine said that \"just before the September 11 attacks\", Richard Elrond, who was hurt in the \"Days of Rage\", was given an apology from Ayers and Dohrn. \"[T]hey were remorseful,\" Elrod says. \"They said, 'We're sorry that things turned out this way.'\" Ayers gave a lot of interviews before his book was published. In these interviews he defended his history of radical words and actions. Some of the articles were written before the September 11 attacks and appeared right after. Many comments were made by the media comparing the statements that Ayers was making about his past just as a terrorist incident shocked the public. A lot of the controversy about Ayers in the years since 2000 comes from an interview that he gave to The New York Times.NB that although the interview was published on 9/11, it was completed before that and cannot be properly regarded as a reaction to the events of that day. The reporter quoted him as saying \"I don't regret setting bombs\" and \"I feel we didn't do enough\". When asked if he would \"do it all again,\" he said \"I don't want to discount the possibility.\" Ayers questioned the interviewer's way of describing him in a \"Letter to the Editor\" on September 15 2001. In his letter, Ayers wrote: \"This is not a question of being misunderstood or 'taken out of context', but of deliberate distortion.\"Bill Ayers, Clarifying the Facts— a letter to the New York Times, 9-15-2001, Bill Ayers (blog), April 21, 2008 In the following years, Ayers has said that what he meant by saying that he had \"no regrets\" and \"we didn't do enough\" he was talking about their efforts to stop the US from fighting in the Vietnam War. He said these efforts were \". . . inadequate [as] the war dragged on for a decade.\"Bill Ayers, Episodic Notoriety–Fact and Fantasy, Bill Ayers (blog), April 6, 2008 Ayers has repeatedly said that the two statements did not mean that he wished they had set more bombs.Bill Ayers, WordPress.com, I'm Sorry!!!!... I think, Bill Ayers (blog) ====Views since 2001==== Ayers was asked in a 2004 interview, \"How do you feel about what you did? Would you do it again under similar circumstances?\" He said:Web page titled \"Weather Underground/ Exclusive interview: Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers\" , Independent Lens website, accessed June 5, 2008 \"I've thought about this a lot. Being almost 60, it's impossible to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things, but the question of did we do something that was horrendous, awful? ... I don't think so. I think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable.\" On September 9, 2008, journalist Jake Tapper talked about the comic strip in Ayers' blog, where he explained the soundbite: \"The one thing I don't regret is opposing the war in Vietnam with every ounce of my being.... When I say, 'We didn't do enough,' a lot of people rush to think, 'That must mean, \"We didn't bomb enough shit.\"' But that's not the point at all. It's not a tactical statement, it's an obvious political and ethical statement. In this context, 'we' means 'everyone.'\"Bill Ayers: Violent Resistance Not Necessarily the Answer Blog post in Little Green Footballs with a copy of the cartoon including the word \"shit\"Tapper, Jake In a Not-Remotely-Comic Strip, Bill Ayers Weighs In on What He Meant By 'We Didn't Do Enough' to End Vietnam War ABC News, Political Punch, September 9, 2008 In 2008, Ayers said this about his actions: > The Weather Underground crossed lines of legality, of propriety and perhaps > even of common sense. Our effectiveness can be — and still is being — > debated. He also again defended his actions against charges of terrorism: > The Weather Underground went on to take responsibility for placing several > small bombs in empty offices.... We did carry out symbolic acts of extreme > vandalism directed at monuments to war and racism, and the attacks on > property, never on people, were meant to respect human life and convey > outrage and determination to end the Vietnam war. == Political views == In an interview that Ayers gave in 1995, he said of his political beliefs in the 1960s and 1970s: \"I am a radical, Leftist, small 'c' communist ... [Laughs] Maybe I'm the last communist who is willing to admit it. [Laughs] We have always been small 'c' communists in the sense that we were never in the Communist party and never Stalinists. The ethics of communism still appeal to me. I don't like Lenin as much as the early Marx. I also like Henry David Thoreau, Mother Jones and Jane Addams [...]\"Chepesiuk, Ron, \"Sixties Radicals, Then and Now: Candid Conversations With Those Who Shaped the Era\", McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers: Jefferson, North Carolina, 1995, \"Chapter 5: Bill Ayers: Radical Educator\", p. 102 In 1970 Ayers was called \"a national leader\"Flint, Jerry, M., \"2d Blast Victim's Life Is Traced: Miss Oughton Joined a Radical Faction After College\", news article, The New York Times, March 19, 1970 of the Weatherman organization and \"one of the chief theoreticians of the Weathermen\" by The New York Times.Kifner, John, \"That's what the Weathermen are supposed to be ... 'Vandals in the Mother Country'\", article, The New York Times magazine, January 4, 1970, page 15 The Weatherman started off as part of the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) within the SDS. They split from the RYM's Maoists saying they had no time to build another party. They also said that war against the United States government and capitalism should begin right away. Their founding paper called for the creation of a \"white fighting force\" to fight with the \"Black Liberation Movement\" and other \"anti-colonial' movements. to achieve \"the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism.\"See document 5, In June 1974, the Underground released their 151-page work called \"Prairie Fire\". \"Prairie Fire\" said that: \"We are a guerrilla organization [...] We are communist women and men underground in the United States [...]\"Franks, Lucinda, \"U.S. Inquiry Finds 37 In Weather Underground\", news article, The New York Times, March 3, 1975 The Weatherman's leaders, including Ayers, wanted radical changes to sexual relations and used the slogan \"Smash Monogamy\".Ron Jacobs, The Way the Wind Blew, p. 46.No Regrets for a Love Of Explosives; In a Memoir of Sorts, a War Protester Talks of Life With the Weathermen NY Times, Sep 11, 2001 ===Claims by Grathwohl=== Larry Grathwohl, who was an FBI agent who joined the Underground, said that Ayers wanted to overthrow the United States government. In an interview that he gave in January 2009, Grathwohl said that: > \"The thing the most bone chilling thing Bill Ayers said to me was that after > the revolution succeeded and the government was overthrown, they believed > they would have to eliminate 25 million Americans who would not conform to > the new order.\"Ayers' speech interrupted by protesters by Alan Wang, ABC7 > News, KGO-TV San Francisco, January 28, 2009. Ayers replied: > \"Never said it. Never thought it. And again, Larry Grathwohl, I don't know > him today, but certainly the FBI was an organization built on lies.\" In an interview with ABC7 reporter Alan Wang, Ayers said that \"Now that's being blown into dishonest narratives about hurting people, killing people, planning to kill people. That's just not true. We destroyed government property,\" said Ayers. However, when asked if he ever made bombs, Ayers replied: \"I'm just not going to talk about it.\" ===Relationship with President Obama=== During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, a controversy started about Ayers' contact with then-Senator Barack Obama. This had been well known in Chicago for years. After being raised by the British press The ties between Ayers and Obama was written about by blogs and newspapers in the United States. The issue was also talked about in a debate by moderator George Stephanopoulos. It later became an issue for John McCain's campaign. \"The New York Times\", CNN, and several other news groups said that Obama does not have a close friendship with Ayers. After the election, Ayers said he did not have any close ties with Obama and condemned the Republicans for using \"guilt by association\" tactics. In a new afterword to his book, he added a note saying that he knew the Obamas \"as neighbors and family friends.\" But in an interview with Good Morning America, Ayers said the afterword was \"describing there how the blogosphere characterized the relationship.\" ==Academic career== Ayers teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
