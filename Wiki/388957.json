 "text": "Sainte-Mélanie is a municipality in the Lanaudière region of Quebec, Canada. It is part of the Joliette Regional County Municipality. It is located along the western shores of the L'Assomption River. ==History== Sainte-Mélanie used to be part of the territory of the Ailleboust Seignory, which was given to Jean d'Ailleboust d'Argenteuil (1694-1785) in 1736. By 1800, Pierre-Louis Panet (1761-1812) was Lord of Ailleboust. His daughter Charlotte-Mélanie Panet (1794-1872) may have been the source of the name Sainte-Mélanie, also a reference to Melania the Younger (383-439). Charlotte-Mélanie's husband, Marc- Antoine-Louis Lévesque (1782-1833), donated the land in 1814 for a chapel that was built in 1830. The Parish of Sainte-Mélanie was founded in 1832. Four years later, in 1836, the post office opened under the name Daillebout. ==Sources== Category:Cities and towns in Quebec",
