 "text": "Homalocephale was a thick-skulled, plant-eating dinosaur. Its flat head housed a very thick skull, a tiny brain, and large eyes. The skull consisted of porous, non-rigid bone interlaced with blood vessels. Homalocephale grew to be about 5 feet long (1.5 m) and weighed about 95 pounds (43 kg). Homalocephale probably had a good sense of smell. It had bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull. It had leaf-shaped teeth, short forelimbs and a stiff tail. category:Pachycephalosauria",
