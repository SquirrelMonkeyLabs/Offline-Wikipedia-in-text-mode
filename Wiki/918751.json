 "text": "The Beal Conjecture is the USD $1,000,000 prize conjecture created by Andrew Beal in 1993, which has come to be worth 7 figures over nearly 30 years; a 2-year wait is lifted by the Beal bank on winnings, according to the conjecture's website. It is a generalization conjecture of FLT, the last conjecture of Pierre de Fermat. So in terms of valuation of the prize, it's worth less than a million; due to the time value of money or TVM. The conjecture asks why common factors always exist for equations of the form a^x+b^y=c^z. If the equations are made equivalent to batteries, cells are always a real number; an RCF- real common factor. Category:1993 establishments Category:Conjectures Category:Number theory",
