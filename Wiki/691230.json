 "text": "Nikolay Igorevich Pimenov (; born 29 March 1958) is a retired Soviet and Russian rower. He mostly competed in the coxless pairs, rowing with his twin brother Yuriy. The brothers won a silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The Pimenovs also won three gold, three silver and one bronze medal at the World Rowing Championships between 1981 and 1990. They finished in 6th at the 1988 Olympics and 15th place at the 1988 Olympics. Because of the Soviet Union's boycott of the 1984 Olympics, the brothers went to the Friendship Games instead, where they won gold. Pimenov was born in Moscow. His brother, Yuriy, died on 19 April 2019, at the age of 61. ==References== ==Other websites== * Nikolay Pimenov at Sports-Reference.com Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Soviet rowers Category:Olympic silver medalists for the Soviet Union Category:Sportspeople from Moscow Category:Twin people",
