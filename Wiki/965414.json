 "text": "Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential Î±-amino acid. This essential amino acid is neutral and nonpolar. This is because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and the skin pigment melanin. It is encoded by the codons UUU and UUC. == References == Category:Amino acids",
