 "text": "The Ochlandrae reed frog (Raorchestes ochlandrae) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen this frog in the Kakkayam Reserve Forest in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 700 and 1200 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 22.1â€“25.6 mm long from nose to rear end and one adult female frog was 23.3 mm long. Its body is long and flat. The skin of its back is brown to cream to yellow in color with two yellow marks from its eyes to the backs of its legs. This frog lives in reed brakes. This frog cannot make its own holes in bamboo plants. It lives in holes that the Nilgiri palm squirrel (Funambulus sublineatus) makes. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. The adult male frog sometimes cares for the young. There are fewer of this frog than there were years ago. Scientists think this could be because human beings build dams that stop water where the frogs live. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, can live on other frogs in Raorchestes, so scientists think it could make this frog sick too. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
