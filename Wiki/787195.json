A forum was added in 2000. The website was less maintained from about 2004, and was redesigned from November 2005, until ending private beta in August 2006. The website's popularity now required many resources, so in 2007, it stopped being sponsored and was moved to dedicated hardware, which is so expensive the community is asked to pay the running costs. Since 2006, it has been possible to download multiple files at once using BitTorrent. ==Operations and quality control== Users upload files, which the website's staff check for integrity and quality. ==Mentions in publications== ModArchive was mentioned in the PC music freeware roundup in Sound on Sound magazine. ModArchive (v3.1) was featured as Site of the Month in Computer Music magazine. ==References== ==Other websites== * ** BitTorrent tracker Category:Music websites",
