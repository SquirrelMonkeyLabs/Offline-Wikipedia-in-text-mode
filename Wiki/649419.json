 "text": "Old Alton Bridge, also known as Goatman's Bridge, is a historic iron through- truss bridge connecting the Texas cities of Denton and Copper Canyon. It was built in 1884. It originally carried horses and later automobiles over Hickory Creek at a location that once was a popular ford for crossing cattle. The bridge takes its name from the abandoned community of Alton, which between 1850-1856 was the seat of Denton County.David Minor, \"ALTON, TX (DENTON COUNTY)\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed November 14, 2010 Locally, the bridge is known as \"Goatman's Bridge\", due to a legendary demonic folk legend of the same name, who is popularly believed to live in the forest surrounding the area. ==Gallery== File:Goatman's Bridge - Old Alton Bridge from a Drone.jpg File:Old Alton Bridge in Denton, Texas 4.jpg File:Old Alton Bridge in Denton, Texas 3.jpg File:Old Alton Bridge in Denton, Texas 2.jpg File:Altonbridge1.JPG File:Altonbridge2.JPG File:Altonbridge3.JPG ==References== Category:Bridges in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Texas",
