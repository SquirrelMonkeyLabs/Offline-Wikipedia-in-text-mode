 "text": "Jacques Anquetil (8 January 1934 – 18 November 1987), was a French road racing cyclist. He was the first cyclist to win the Tour de France five times, in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964. Anquetil was very good at riding time trials, and this helped him to win grand tours. He also won the Giro d'Italia in 1960 and 1964, and the Vuelta a España in 1963. This made him the first cyclist to win all three grand tours. In 1956 he rode 46.159 kilometres in one hour, making a new hour record. Anquetil was born in Mont-Saint-Aigan. He died of stomach cancer in Rouen. == Major achievements == ; Tour de France : 1957 - 1st overall; 4 stage wins; 16 days in maillot jaune : 1959 - 3rd overall : 1961 - 1st overall; 2 stage wins; 21 days in maillot jaune : 1962 - 1st overall; 2 stage wins; 3 days in maillot jaune : 1963 - 1st overall; 4 stage wins; 5 days in maillot jaune : 1964 - 1st overall; 4 stage wins; 5 days in maillot jaune ; Giro d'Italia : 1959 - 2nd overall; Stage 2 ITT win; Stage 19 ITT win; 7 days in maglia rosa : 1960 - 1st overall; Stage 9b ITT win; Stage 14 ITT win; 11 days in maglia rosa : 1961 - 2nd overall; Stage 9 ITT win; 4 days in maglia rosa : 1964 - 1st overall; Stage 5 ITT win; 17 days in maglia rosa ; Vuelta a España : 1963 - 1st overall; 1 stage win; 16 days in jersey de oro ; Other one-day classics and stage races : Super Prestige Pernod International (1961, 1963, 1965, 1966) : Grand Prix des Nations (1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1965, 1966) : Liège-Bastogne-Liège (1966) : Gent-Wevelgem (1964) : Bordeaux-Paris (1965) : Dauphiné Libéré (1963 - 1st overall; 1 stage win; 1965 - 1st overall, 3 stage wins) : Paris-Nice :: 1957 - 1st overall; 1 stage win - Time Trial Stage :: 1961 - 1st overall; 1 stage win :: 1963 - 1st overall; 1 stage win :: 1965 - 1st overall; 1 stage win :: 1966 - 1st overall; 1 stage win : Vuelta al País Vasco (1969) : Four Days of Dunkirk (1958, 1959) ; Hour record in 1956 - 46.159 km ==Other websites== *Complete Palmarès *Gitane USA Category:1934 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in France Category:Deaths from stomach cancer Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:French cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia winners Category:Tour de France winners Category:Vuelta a España winners Category:People from Seine- Maritime Category:Sportspeople from Normandy",
