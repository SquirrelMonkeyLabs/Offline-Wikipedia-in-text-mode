 "text": "The Georg Büchner Prize (German: Georg-Büchner-Preis) is the most important literary prize of Germany. It was created in 1923 in memory of German writer Georg Büchner and was only given to artists who came from or were closely tied to Büchner's home of Hesse. In 1951, the prize changed to a general literary prize, given yearly by the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung. It goes to German language authors, and the annual speech by the recipient takes place in Darmstadt. Since 2002, the prize has been endowed with 40,000 Euros. == Famous recipients of the literary prize, since 1951 == *2004 Wilhelm Genazino (1943-2018) *1998 Elfriede Jelinek (born 1946) *1986 Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–1990) *1973 Peter Handke (born 1942) *1972 Elias Canetti (1905–1994) *1967 Heinrich Böll (1917–1985) *1965 Günter Grass (1927-2015) == Famous recipients 1923-1950== *1947 Anna Seghers (1900-1983) ==Other websites== * http://www.deutscheakademie.de/preise_buechner.html * The spell of a tender eel, on 2006 prizewinner Oskar Pastior Category:Literary awards Category:Darmstadt",
