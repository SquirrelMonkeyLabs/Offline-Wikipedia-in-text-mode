 "text": "Myron Thomas \"M. T.\" Liggett (December 28, 1930 â€“ August 17, 2017) was an American folk sculptor. He was born near Mullinville, Kansas. He exhibited hundreds of his artworks on the roads of Mullinville. His works were often made of painted, welded metal and often contained re-used farm implements, such as combine discs. His art is often critical of politicians on the local, state, and federal level. Many of his works are kinetic and move with the wind. ==Work== Liggett's main work was the land along his front fence, on the north side of U.S. Route 400 in Mullinville. He was also a featured artist at the Folk Art Museum in Lucas, Kansas.Kansas Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities & Other Offbeat Stuff By Pam Grout Edition: 2, illustrated Published by Globe Pequot, 2006 , 9780762741045 Page 288 Road trip America: a state-by-state tour guide to offbeat destinations By Andrew F.
