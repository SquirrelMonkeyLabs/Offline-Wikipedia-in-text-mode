 "text": "International waters is a body of water that does not belong to any single country. \"International waters\" is not a defined term in international law. It is an informal term. The Convention on the High Seas 1958 defined \"high seas\" to mean \"all parts of the sea that are not included in the territorial sea or in the internal waters of a State\" and \"no State may validly... subject any part of them to its sovereignty\".Text of CONVENTION ON THE HIGH SEAS (U.N.T.S. No. 6465, vol. 450, pp. 82â€“103) Therefore \"high seas\" and \"international waters\" share a basic idea: that no country can own them. == References == Category:Bodies of water Category:Law of the sea",
