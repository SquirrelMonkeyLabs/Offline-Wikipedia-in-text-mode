 "text": "Emilio's ground frog (Eupsophus emiliopugini) is a frog. It lives in Chile and Argentina.. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground near streams in forests with water in the air. Scientists found this frog under logs or in holes near sterams. Scientists saw this frog between 0 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in Parque Nacional Lago Puelo in Argentina and at least six more parks in Chile. ==Young== The adult female frog lays eggs in holes. The tadpoles stay in the nest for a long time even though they do not eat any food. Scientists think the adult frogs might watch the eggs and tadpoles, but they are not sure. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is not in danger of dying out and scientists from Argentina say this frog is in a little danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make tree farms. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
