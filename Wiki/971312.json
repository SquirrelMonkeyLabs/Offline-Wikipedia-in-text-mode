 "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance is a Grammy Award given to musicians who have made very good rock music. It was made in 2012 to combine three other award groups: Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 2014, hard rock performances were put into the award group. This is because the Grammy Awards got rid of the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance award. == Winners == Year Performing artist(s) Work Ref. 2012 Foo Fighters \"Walk\" 2013 The Black Keys \"Lonely Boy\" 2014 Imagine Dragons \"Radioactive\" 2015 Jack White \"Lazaretto\" 2016 Alabama Shakes \"Don't Wanna Fight\" 2017 David Bowie \"Blackstar\" 2018 Leonard Cohen \"You Want It Darker\" 2019 Chris Cornell \"When Bad Does Good\" Grammy.com, 7 December 2018 2020 Gary Clark Jr. \"This Land\" 2021 Fiona Apple \"Shameika\" 2021 Nominations List 2022 Foo Fighters \"Making a Fire\" == References == Category:Grammy Awards",
