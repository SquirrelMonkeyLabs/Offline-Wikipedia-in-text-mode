She became president following the resignation of President Evo Morales. She was a Senator, representing Beni. She is the second female President of Bolivia. ==Presidency== During this political crisis, and after the resignation of President Evo Morales and other officials in the line of succession, Áñez declared herself next in line to assume the presidency. Áñez declared herself president of the Senate, then used that position to become president, a move that was legally supported. Áñez issued a decree removing criminal liability for military and police in dealing with protesters. She oversaw the Senkata and Sacaba massacres. Her government launched numerous criminal investigations into former MAS officials, for which she was accused of political persecution. She ended Bolivia's close links with the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, while bettering relations with the United States. After delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and protests, new elections were held in October 2020. Áñez launched her own presidential campaign, with criticism saying that she was not neutral. She withdrew her candidacy a month before the election after low poll numbers. ==Arrest== In the early hours of 13 March 2021, Áñez was arrested on charges of terrorism, sedition and conspiracy over her actions during the 2019 coup of Evo Morales. In June 2022, she was sentenced to ten years in prison for her role in the 2019 political crisis.Bolivia: Former President Jeanine Áñez sentenced over 'coup' ==References== ==Other websites== * Jeanine Añez Chávez Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Bolivia Category:Bolivian lawyers",
