 "text": "Leave No Trace, or LNT, is a set of ethics about keeping the outdoors clean. It started in the mid 1900's because of damage to the environment in the United States because of camping and related activities. In 1994, the not for profit Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics was formed to create educational resources around LNT and created seven principles of LNT. These are: # Plan ahead and prepare # Travel and camp on durable surfaces # Dispose of waste properly # Leave what you find # Minimize campfire impacts # Respect wildlife # Be considerate of others The idea is to leave the wilderness unchanged by people camping. ==References==",
