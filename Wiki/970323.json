 "text": "The four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover. According to traditional sayings, these clovers bring good luck, though it is not clear when or how this idea began. One early mention of \"Fower-leafed or purple grasse\" is from 1640 and says that it was kept in gardens because it was \"good for the purples (Purpura) in children or others\".Parkinson J. 1640.
