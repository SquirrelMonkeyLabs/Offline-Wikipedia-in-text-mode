 "text": "Kapilendra deva's conquest of Gauda, also known as the Conquest of Gauda, Was a military campaign by the Gajapati ruler Kapilendra deva in Gauda region of Bengal, which ended successfully. ==Backround== The Gopinathpur inscription of 1447 CE describes his campaign against the Sultan of Bengal who tried to raid Odisha but was beaten back by the Gajapati army led by Gopinath Mahapatra, the minister of Kapilendra Deva. ==Campaign== The Gajapati army conquered territories of Bengal to the west of Ganga river including the fort of Gar Mandaran. Historian R. Subramaniam describes that the title 'Brhamarbara' retained by Kapilendra Deva from the days of his service at the Ganga king's court clearly signifies his control over Brhamarkuta region of Bengal. An inscription in the Jagannath temple of Puri that is dated to the year 1450 CE narrates the conquest of Gauda by Kapilendra Deva after defeating Malika Parisa (Malik Padsah) which in short refers to the contemporary Sultan of Bengal by the name Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah. The region east of the river Ganga and until modern Burdhawan district was known as the Jaleswar division, which was handed over to the later ruler of Bengal Ali Vardi Khan by the Marathas during their time.Kapilendra Deva's aide Jalesara Narendra Mahapatra was appointed as the governor of this region. After this victory, Kapilendra Deva accepts the title epithet of Gaudeswara meaning the Lord of the Gauda kingdom. Katakarajavanshavalli records state about the holy dip of the Gajapati himself in the river Ganges and the DƒÅna of Tulasipur shasan villages to the Brahmins there. This clearly indicates that Kapilendra Deva was in control of regions beyond the river Ganga to its East. ==Aftermath== All the territories of the south west bengal including the Mandaran fort which was initially captured by Sultan Samsuddin Illyas shah got reconquered , Gauda region of Bengal came under Gajapati rule and Kapilendra deva proclaimed himself as \"The lord of Gauda\"(Bengal). == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:India",
