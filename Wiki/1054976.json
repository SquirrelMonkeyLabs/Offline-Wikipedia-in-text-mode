 "text": "A bicycle kick is a very difficult type of shooting skill done by Football players. It is normally done when another player does a lob pass to the player, but the ball is high and behind the receiving player, so he or she has to pull back and jump like a back flip while kicking the ball into the post. It is very difficult to do and only becomes a goal in rare occasions. Category:Association football",
