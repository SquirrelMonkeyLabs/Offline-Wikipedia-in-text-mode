 "text": "A low pressure area, or low for short, is a word used in meteorology (the study of weather) that means a place where the atmospheric pressure is lowest compared to the surrounding area. Coriolis effect causes winds to blow counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in southern hemisphere. This makes storms like tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, subtropical cyclones, and subpolar cyclones. They are called \"low-pressure cells\" in some English-speaking countries.
