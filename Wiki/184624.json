 "text": "This is a list of crossings of the River Thames including bridges, tunnels and ferries. There are almost 214 bridges, over 20 tunnels, six public ferries and one ford. The list starts at the downstream (Estuary) end and follows the river upstream towards the start of the river. A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings making use of walkways across lock gates and bridges above or near-by weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not fully cross the river, or are for the use of authorised people only, and are so are not listed. Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services along the river in the city of London, and tourist boat services running both in London and upstream. Although the main purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so. == North Sea to London == *proposed Lower Thames Crossing at or east of Dartford Crossing - three options announced in April 2009 *Gravesend – Tilbury Ferry, a passenger ferry. *High Speed 1 rail tunnels from Swanscombe in Kent to West Thurrock in Essex.
