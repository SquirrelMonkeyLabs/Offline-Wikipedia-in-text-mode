Dix was part of the Uttarkashi rescue, where 41 workers were trapped nearly 200 feet below the surface == Early life == Dix is a engineering professor, scientist, and barrister. His father who was a salesman for used cars emigrated from New Zealand while his mother was a graduate of Melbourneâ€™s Emily McPherson College of Domestic Economy. Eventually, his parents became publicans, causing them to move a lot between Melbourne, Benalla and Jindabyne. He graduated from Melbourne's Monash University with a degree in science and law. == Career == Dix is a registered barrister at the High Court of Australia and is also a senior counsel at the White & Case legal firm. He also a visiting professor of Engineering at the Tokyo City University. He is also an underground work expert. His interest in this field was inspired during the September 11 attacks, after Dix went to New York with a client to investigate the underground networks of the World Trade Centre. Dix has also been involved in investigation of tower block fires and recommending solutions. Between 2009 to 2010, Dix served as an independent as an independent investigator of the Lakanal House Tower Block Fire, which killed six people. He also investigated the Grenfell Tower fire which caused at least 80 deaths. He pointed out weak fire assessment systems in the United Kingdom as a contributor to these fires. In 2019, Dix volunteered with the Qatar Red Crescent, developing response swiftness for underground accidents. In 2020, Dix together with Lord Robert Mair and Peter Vickery QC founded Underground Works Chambers. Dix is the president of the Geneva-based International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association. === Uttarakhand tunnel rescue === On November 20 2023 Dix was called on by the Government of India, to be part of the team that rescued 41 workers trapped in the Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand, India. He worked together with other agencies including ONGC, SJVNL, RVNL, NHIDCL, and THDCL. He promised that he would safely evacuate all 41 workers before Christmas, which the team managed to do. He helped inspect the collapsed tunnel, coordinated agencies and gave technical solutions to enable the rescue. Dix suggested the use of the soft mining techniques. This method would reduce disturbances to the mountain and cause another avalanche which would put the trapped workers at risk. The rescuers had previously been using large drilling machines, which were causing vibrations to the mountain. These machines also broke down from hitting metal obstacles in the collapsed tunnel, resulting to the rescue operation being halted. They used a thin pipe to carry the trapped workers 10 centimeters at a time, which prevented further disturbance. While Dix's approach was slower it was much safer Throughout the rescue operation, Dix showed a display of faith which garnered the attention of the public. During the operation he set up a makeshift temple and after the workers were rescued, he offered his prayers to the temple of local deity Baba Bokh Naag ji . He said that the rescue was a miracle and promised the locals to go to the temple once the workers were rescued. In 2023, Dix proved to be a hero during the Uttarakhand tunnel rescue. He received recognition from Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for his work during the rescue operations. ==Awards and Honors== * Alan Neyland Australasian Tunnelling Society bi-annual award (2011) * NFPA -Distinguished Committee Service Award (2022) * Keynote speaker at Bulk Tanker Day == Personal Life == Dix is married to Divina Dix and share a stepchild together.
