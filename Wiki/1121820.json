 "text": "Chrétien de Troyes ( ; ; 1160–1191) was a French poet and trouvère. He was known for writing about many Arthurian people. He wrote about Gawain, Lancelot, Perceval and the Holy Grail. He wrote many chivalric romances. Some of his works were Erec and Enide, Lancelot, Perceval and Yvain. They were some of the most important works in medieval literature. His book structures were important in creating a modern novel. ==Life== There is not much known about his life. He was probably from Troyes, or was connected to it. Between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne. Later, he served the court of Philippe d'Alsace, Count of Flanders. His name, which meant \"Christian from Troyes\", might be a pen name of a person who converted from Judiasm to Christianity. == References == ==Sources== *Loomis, Roger Sherman (1991).
