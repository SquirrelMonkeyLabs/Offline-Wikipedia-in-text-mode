He also played one match for the Austrian national football team. ==Career == Thaler made his debut in the top league in 1929 for SC Nicholson. In the following two seasons he became a regular player. In 1932 he moved to SK Admira Wien. He only stayed for a few months and moved to Wiener AC for the second half of the season. When the WAC faced serious economic difficulties in the mid-1930s, Thaler returned to FC Wien. There he was now used in defense. FC Wien took seventh place in 1937/38. Due to the reorganization of the top division after the annexation of Austria and the inclusion of provincial teams, the club was relegated. Thaler moved to RB Wacker Wiener Neustadt, which he left after just half a season. Thaler then joined First Vienna FC. During the war years he was part of the Vienna team that won the championship three times. As a guest player during the war, Thaler worked for Wilhelmshaven 05 for a long time. ==International == In June 1931 there was a inoffical match against the Switzerland national football team, in which Thaler came on as a substitute for Roman Schramseis.
