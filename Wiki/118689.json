The first is bipolar novelist Virginia Woolf (Kidman) trying to write the novel Mrs Dalloway in Richmond, Surrey in 1923. The second is Laura Brown, a housewife in California in 1951 who is reading the novel. The third is Clarissa Vaughan, who lives in New York City in 2001 and tends to a gay poet named Richard. He often calls her \"Mrs. D\" or \"Mrs. Dalloway\" in reference to the novel. The movie moves from one character to another many times and each character is shown for a similar amount of time. Woolf struggles to write her novel. Her hand shakes and she cannot write well. The movie begins with her suicide where she fills her pockets full of rocks and drowns herself in the river Ouse in Sussex. In flashback, it shows her difficulty writing. Her sister Vanessa Bell comes over. Woolf is very fascinated when her niece Angelica finds a dead bird. Woolf kisses her sister very hard when she leaves.

She makes a cake with her son for her husband and does it again when the first one does not come out right. Her friend Kitty is going to a doctor; something is wrong with her. Finally, she takes her son Richie and leaves him at a babysitter and rents a hotel room. She starts reading the book and then we see what it is through her mind â€“ she suddenly imagines that there is a lot of water coming up, like she is drowning.

In the end, however, Richard kills himself by jumping out of the window. ==Other websites== * * Category:2002 drama movies Category:2002 LGBT movies Category:Academy Award winning movies Category:American drama movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:Bipolar disorder in fiction Category:British drama movies Category:British LGBT movies Category:Golden Globe Award winning movies Category:HIV/AIDS in movies Category:LGBT drama movies Category:Miramax movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies set in California Category:Movies set in New York City Category:Movies set in the 1920s Category:Movies set in the 1950s Category:Paramount Pictures movies Category:Suicide in movies",
