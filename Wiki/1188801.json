 "text": "Río Los Cipreses National Reserve is a protected place in Machalí, Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region, Chile. People named it for Río Los Cipreses, a small river that flows into the Cachapoal River. This park is in a part of the Andes that has many walls of ice. The reserve contains forests low on the hills and mountain grassland high in the mountains. It also protects some of the northernmost stands of Austrocedrus chilensis. Mountain climbers come to the reserve to climb its mountain trails, including trails on the Palomo volcano, Alto de Los Arrieros, and Cerro Dr. Hernán Cruz. The reserve also has prehispanic ancient stone writing and pictures and many kinds of plants and animals. As of 2012, there were not many ways to come to the reserve on public transport. Some tour companies in Rancagua sell trips to the reserve. File:Rio_de_los_Cipreses.jpg|River and gorge running through the center of the reserve.
