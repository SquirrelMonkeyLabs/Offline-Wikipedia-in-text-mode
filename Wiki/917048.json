 "text": "Eddie Eagle is a gun safety mascot. He was made by the National Rifle Association of America. He is the main character of two videos about guns. These videos were made for children. The first video was made in the 1980s. The other was made in 2015. It is computer animated. There is an official website about the character. Four studies have shown that the videos did not help children be safe around guns. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Mascots",
