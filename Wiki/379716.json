 "text": "Brian Griffin is one of the main characters in the American animated TV sitcom, Family Guy. He is at least a 10-year-old pet dog of the Griffin family. He shows many human behaviours (he can walk upright, drink, smoke, and speak English) but he still shows many behaviours associated with dogs, such as fetching a ball, fearing the vacuum cleaner and barking at squirrels. It is hinted that Lois and Brian were married for a length of time. He is the only Family Guy character to have appeared in every episode of the series. In a 2004 interview, Seth MacFarlane (the show's creator) revealed that Brian is his fursona. ==Death== In the 12th season episode, \"Life of Brian\", he gets hit by a car and dies later at the veterinarian. Before he dies, he thanked the Griffins for giving him a wonderful life and that he loves them all. He was soon brought back to life in the Christmas special \"Christmas Guy\".SPOILER ALERT: Risen from the dead! Brian Griffin is resurrected on Family Guy Christmas special after fan outrage ==References== Category:Family Guy characters Category:Anthromophic characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional dogs",
