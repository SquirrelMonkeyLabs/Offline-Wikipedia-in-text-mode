 "text": "In very simple language, PCOS is a condition in which a woman faces many hormonal imbalances which not only affect her physical health but also her mental health. Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most prevalent female endocrine health matters. PCOS is a complex and heterogeneous problem of uncertain cause, although there is major evidence that the PCOS can be classified as a genetic health problem. This condition produces symptoms in between five percent to ten percent of females during reproductive ages. Problems include although are not limited to hormones, resulting in acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), resistance to insulin (which then results in diabetes mellitus, in particular Type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults). Other problems caused by PCOS are being overweight and (in some women) high cholesterol levels. The symptoms and severity vary greatly among affected women. Treatments include weight reduction, low-dose oral contraceptive pills, medroxyprogesterone and spironolactone. Clomiphene can be used as the treatment for those women who wish to get pregnant. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the female reproductive system category:Syndromes",
