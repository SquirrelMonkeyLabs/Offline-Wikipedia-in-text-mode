 "text": "David Murray Dryden (September 5, 1941 â€“ October 4, 2022) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. Dryden was known for the distinction of creating (as well as being the first goaltender to employ) the modern day goaltending mask consisting of a fiberglass mask with a cage. ==Playing career== Before playing in the NHL, Dryden played 2 seasons in the OHA playing for the Toronto St. Michael's. In the NHL, he played for the New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks, Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers. Dryden faced his brother Ken in a game between his Sabres and the Montreal Canadiens. It was the only time in the history of the NHL that brothers opposed each other as goalies. Dryden was the goalie against whom Wayne Gretzky scored his first professional goal. During his time in the WHA, he played for the Chicago Cougars and Edmonton Oilers. He won the Ben Hatskin Trophy as the WHA's top goaltender, and the Gordie Howe Trophy as league MVP. Since retiring from playing professional ice hockey in 1979, he became the chair person of Sleeping Children Around the World charity which was founded by his father and provides bed kits to children in developing countries. On October 4, 2022, Dryden died at his home in Oakville, Ontario from a disease known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. ==Reference== == Other websites == * Category:1941 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Buffalo Bisons (AHL) players Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Central Professional Hockey League players Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Edmonton Oilers players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:New York Rangers players Category:Ontario Hockey League players Category:Rochester Americans players Category:World Hockey Association players Category:Sportspeople from Hamilton, Ontario",
