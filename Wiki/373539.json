 "text": "Thomas Coryat (c. 1577â€“1617) was an English traveller and writer of the late Elizabethan times. He is remembered today for two books he wrote about his travels through Europe and parts of Asia. He often travelled on foot to get to far off places. Coryat reached as far as India in his travels from England. At that time the Mughal Emperor Jahangir was ruling there and he rewarded Coryat and gave him money to reach back home. However, Coryat died in Surat, Gujarat, before he could return.
