 "text": "Samuel Ajayi Crowther (c. 1809 – 31 December 1891) was a Yoruba linguist, clergyman, and the first African bishop of the West African Anglican Church. Crowther was born in Osogun now Ado-Awaye, Oyo State, Nigeria. He and his family were kidnapped by slave raiders during the Yoruba civil war (notably the Owu wars of 1821–1829) in his hometown Osogun when he was about thirteen years old. Ajayi was sold several times before he was later purchased by the Portuguese slave traders, who finally took him to the New World across the Atlantic.https://www.bu.edu/missiology/missionary-biography/c-d/crowther- samuel-adjai-or-ajayi-c-1807-1891/ ==References== Category:Anglican bishops Category:Anglican priests Category:Nigerian Christian clergy Category:Translators Category:1800s births Category:1891 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Converts to Christianity Category:Slaves Category:Linguists Category:People from Oyo State",
