 "text": "The May Fourth Movement started in Beijing on May 4, 1919, as students protested the Treaty of Versailles, which gave Japan control over some Chinese territories. The protests spread across China, boosting nationalism and political action, moving away from intellectual elites. This movement was part of the larger New Culture Movement (1915-1921), aiming to challenge Confucian traditions. Many future political leaders, including those in the Chinese Communist Party, emerged during this time. The movement was urban-focused but had a populist tone despite China's rural majority. In 1911, the Qing dynasty collapsed, ending thousands of years of imperial rule. After President Yuan Shikai died in 1916, China was controlled by warlords, and the government in Beijing struggled with foreign influence. The public was angry about Japan’s growing power, especially after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles gave Japan territories in China. This sparked protests, and many intellectuals began pushing for changes to traditional Confucian values, advocating for Western ideas like science and democracy. These ideas influenced China’s culture and politics for many years. On May 4, 1919, over 4,000 students protested in Beijing against Japan's control over Chinese territories. They called for changes in the government and boycotted Japanese goods. The movement spread to other cities, including Shanghai, and gained support from workers and merchants. Despite harsh government actions, the protests led to China's refusal to sign the Treaty of Versailles, marking a symbolic victory. The May Fourth Movement united people across China, shifting the focus from student protests to a broader national movement for change. The May Fourth Movement was a turning point in China's history, challenging traditional values and encouraging new ideas like democracy and science. It led to the growth of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with leaders like Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao promoting Marxism. Although the Kuomintang (KMT) also played a role, their influence was smaller. The movement sparked significant political and cultural changes, and its legacy is still debated by both CCP supporters and critics. Category:Protests Category:Beijing Category:China",
