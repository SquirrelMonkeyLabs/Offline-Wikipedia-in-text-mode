 "text": "A flatbread is a bread made with flour, water, and salt. The flatbread is then rolled into a flattened dough. Many flatbreads are made without yeast: they are unleavened bread. Some have a very little yeast, such as pita and naan. It is also a type that pizza crusts use. The flatbread is usually crispy when done properly. There are many other ingredients that flatbreads may have. Curry powder, diced jalape√±os, chili powder, black pepper, olive oil, sesame oil, etc. may be added. Flatbreads can range from one millimeter to a few centimeters thick. ==References== ==Other websites==",
