The CyberTipline was established by the United States Congress for processing reports of child exploitation (this includes online enticement, child pornography and inappropriate contact with children). The NCMEC reviews the reports and shares them with appropriate law enforcement agencies or Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task forces. Along with the information from the reporting party, NCMEC also adds geolocation information (when appropriate) and cross-references identifying information, like email addresses, usernames and IP addresses with the existing CyberTipline reports. ==Related pages== * AMBER Alert * Child theft * Federal Bureau of Investigation * Kidnapping ==References== == External links == * Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States Category:Child safety Category:1984 establishments in the United States Category:United States law",
