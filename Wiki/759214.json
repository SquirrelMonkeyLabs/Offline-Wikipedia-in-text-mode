It was a 56-year-old Dutchman who had arrived in the Netherlands from Italy. As of 14 May, there are 43,481 confirmed cases of infection and 5,590 confirmed COVID-19-deaths. The first death occurred on 6 March, when an 86-year-old patient died in Rotterdam. ==Response== Measures were taken by the Rutte III cabinet for the public health to prevent the spread of this virus disease, including the “intelligent lockdown”. ==Testing== By mid-March, the country could test about 1,000 samples per day, which is less than other European countries. This explains the large number of deaths in COVID cases there. ==Notes== ==References== Netherlands Category:2020 in the Netherlands Category:2021 in the Netherlands Category:2022 in the Netherlands",
