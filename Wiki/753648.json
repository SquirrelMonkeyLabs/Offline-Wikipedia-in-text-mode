 "text": "The 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election took place on November 3, 1998. Reform Party candidate Jesse Ventura beat Republican Party challenger Norm Coleman and Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party challenger Hubert H. \"Skip\" Humphrey III. Ventura's victory as a third party candidate was seen as a historic major upset, especially since he was a former professional wrestler. He ran on the Reform Party ticket, a party which had been founded by two-time presidential candidate Ross Perot who had received 23% of the vote in Minnesota in the 1992 presidential election and 12% in the 1996 election. ==Primary results== ===Democratic=== ===Republican=== ==Results== ==References== Category:1998 in the United States Category:1990s in Minnesota Category:Gubernatorial elections in the United States",
