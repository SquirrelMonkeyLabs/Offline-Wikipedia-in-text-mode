 "text": "thumb|The second cathedral. Painted in 1802 by William Crotch. Coventry Cathedral, also known as St. Michael's Cathedral, is an Anglican cathedral. It is in Coventry, West Midlands, England. In fact, the city has three cathedrals. The first was St. Mary's, a monastic building, only a few ruins of which remain. The second was St Michael's, a 14th-century Gothic Cathedral, which was largely destroyed by a bombing raid in the Second World War. The cathedral was bombed on 14 November 1940 by the German Luftwaffe, which destroyed much of central Coventry. Nails found in the ruins were formed into a cross and consecrated in the Kaiser Wilhelm Ged√§chtniskirche in Berlin. The third cathedral is the new St Michael's Cathedral, built to replace the bombed cathedral. It is an important example of 20th century architecture. The cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Coventry. The Right Reverend Dr. Christopher Cocksworth is the current Bishop of Coventry. He is the 9th Bishop of Coventry. ==Other websites== Category:Anglican cathedrals in England Category:Organisations based in Coventry Category:Buildings and structures in West Midlands (county)",
