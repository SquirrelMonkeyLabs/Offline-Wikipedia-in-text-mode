 "text": "George Liquor is a character created by John Kricfalusi for The Ren & Stimpy Show. He was voiced by Michael Pataki. ==Background== The executives at Nick didn't like George Liquor at all because his last name sounds like \"lick her\". His second appearance in Man's Best Friend was banned by Nick due to the harsh violence done by both him and Ren. As a result, they gave Kricfalusi the copyright to use his character that isn't Ren & Stimpy. ==Cans Without Labels== George Liquor is the main character of a prolonged and delayed Kickstarter cartoon called Cans Without Labels. It was supposed to be out by 2013 but got delayed 6 years. It is Mike Pataki's last voice role. George gives his nephews Ernie and Slab cans that are bought cheap. He opens the first can, which has a human face in it. The nephews are spooked by the face. George gets angry at the two and decides to have a bathroom break. Ernie and Slab give the can to Donald Bastard (a parody of Donald Duck), and the face was eaten. George offered to open another can but the nephews left the house.
