A US Army officer named it for one of his old commanding officers, Braxton Bragg (1817â€“1876) who was a career U.S. Army officer. He was later a general in the Confederate States Army. Because of this, the town shares a name with Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and they are named for the same man. ==References== Category:Cities in California Category:Settlements in Mendocino County, California",
