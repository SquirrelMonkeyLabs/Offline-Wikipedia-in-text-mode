It is now, the second largest militant group in the Gaza Strip, after Hamas. Currently the AQB's leader is Ziyad al-Nakhalah, who lives in Beirut, Lebanon. The head of AQB in the Gaza Strip was Baha Abu al-Ata until he was killed in a airstrike in November 2019. ==References== Category:Arabâ€“Israeli conflict Category:Gaza Strip Category:National liberation movements Category:Nationalist organizations in Palestine Category:Sunni organizations Category:Islamist militant groups Category:Anti-Israeli sentiment",
