 "text": "Cressida is a closer moon to Uranus. It was found from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 1986-01-09, and was given the designation S/1986 U 3. It was named after the Trojan daughter of Calchas, a tragic heroine who appears in William Shakespeare's play Troilus and Cressida (as well as in tales by Geoffrey Chaucer and others). It is also designated Uranus IX. Cressida belongs to Portia Group of moons, which also includes Bianca, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, radius of 41 km and geometric albedo of 0.08 almost nothing is known about it. At the Voyager 2 images Cressida appears as a stretched object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Cressida's prolate spheroid is 0.8 Â± 0.3. Its surface is grey in color. == References == == Other websites == * Cressida Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration Category:Uranus' moons",
