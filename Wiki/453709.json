 "text": "Twisted Metal 4 is a vehicular combat video game that was both published by Sony Computer Entertainment and developed by 989 Studios. It is the fourth game in the Twisted Metal series. It was only released on the PlayStation and was only released in North America. The game was released on October 31, 1999 in North America for PlayStation. It was rereleased in 2000 as part of the Sony Greatest Hits lineup. ==Reception== IGN's Marc Nix rated the game a 6 out of 10 and praised the \"colorful\" graphics and \"well-done\" interactive environments but criticized the \"toy car\" control, look and sound of the vehicles. GameSpot's Joe Fielder said that the game was a \"huge leap\" ahead of Twisted Metal III, commenting on the improved level design, control and physics, but he also said that the latter two \"remain a little too touchy and unforgiving\" and that the graphics, while they were \"prettier\" than those of Twisted Metal III, they \"aren't nearly as sharp as the graphics in its current main competitor - Activision's Vigilante 8: Second Offense\". ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1999 video games Category:Twisted Metal Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation games Category:PlayStation-only games Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Video games developed in the United States",
