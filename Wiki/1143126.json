They saw it in exactly one place, and that place is a protected park: Parque Nacional de Las Orqu√≠deas. Scientists saw them between 1300 and 1400 meters above sea level. Scientists do not know much about the frog's tadpoles. They do not think the tadpoles swim in streams. Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
