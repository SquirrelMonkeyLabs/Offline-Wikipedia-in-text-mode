Cruz was born in Matanzas, Cuba. He is called by many media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, as an acting surrogate in his son's political campaigns such as his presidential campaign. About his political involvements in the 1980s, Cruz reflected, \"I was on the state board of the Religious Roundtable, a Christian and Jewish religious organization that worked to elect Ronald Reagan.\" At the time, he told his son, \"God has destined you for greatness.\"Brody File Exclusive: Ted Cruz’s Father Tells His Son: 'God Has Destined You for Greatness' , The Brody File, David Brody, July 22, 2013.
