 "text": "The Swedish Navy is the naval branch of the Swedish Armed Forces. It was started under King Gustav I in 1522. It is one of the oldest continuously serving navies in the world, celebrating its 500th anniversary in 2022. For most of the twentieth century, the Swedish Navy focused on the threat of a full-scale invasion of Sweden via the Baltic Sea and on protecting commercial shipping. Sweden's place on the Scandinavian peninsula means that 90% of imports and exports enter or leave Sweden through the Baltic. == References == Category:Government agencies of Sweden Category:Navies Category:1522 establishments",
