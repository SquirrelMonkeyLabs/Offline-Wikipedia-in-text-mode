Like many Opel models, it is sold as a Vauxhall in the United Kingdom. In the North American and Chinese markets it is sold as the Buick Regal since the 2011 model year as a sedan only. The Insignia was originally intended to be the second generation Saturn Aura, but because GM discontinued the Saturn brand it was instead offered to Buick and was marketed as the fifth generation Buick Regal.
