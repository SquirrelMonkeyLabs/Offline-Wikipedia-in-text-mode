 "text": "Sant Alban was the first British Christian martyr.. He was a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity. His home town of Verulamium is now is named St Albans after him. A priest was being chased by the Romans and Alban swapped clothes with the priest so he could escape. When they found out, the Romans ordered Alban to be killed. As he was a fine soldier, he was allowed to be beheaded by the sword than by the axe, because it was more honourable. When they cut off St. Alban's head, the executioner's eyes fell out into his hand, and he was blinded. The bones of Alban were kept in a shrine in St Albans Abbey. They were stolen during the 19th century. ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:3rd-century births Category:304 deaths Category:British Christians Category:Christian saints Category:Converts to Christianity Category:Executed people Category:Roman people",
