 "text": "The Battle of the Kasserine Pass was a battle fought in Tunisia. It was part of the North African Campaign. The battle took place from 19 February 1943 to 24 February 1943. The Axis forces were commanded by Erwin Rommel. They were mostly made from the Afrika Korps and The Italian Centauro Armoured Division. They also included some divisions from the German 5th Panzer Army. The Americans and the II Corps of the U.S Army were led by Lloyd Fredendall. The British 1st Army was led by Kenneth Anderson. This battle is remembered for being the first major battle between the Americans and Germans in World War Two. It was the first battle in which the Americans soldiers fought an enemy with better organization and experienced soldiers. The battle at the beginning was very costly for the Americans. They were forced to retreat from their starting position at the Faid Pass. The Americans were soon reinforced with both American and British reinforcements. They forced Rommel to retreat to better positions. This battle caused a change in American military organization, to better prepare the army for the war in North Africa. Major General Lloyd Fredendal was sent home to the United States. When Rommel and the Americans fought again weeks later, the American improvements were seen in battle. == References == Category:1943 Category:North African battles of World War II Category:20th century in Tunisia",
