 "text": "The consistent life ethic is also known as the consistent ethic of life. It opposes abortion, capital punishment, assisted suicide, euthanasia, and war. Some people who follow this are only opposed to unjust war, and some are full pacifists. The term was made popular in 1983 by Joseph Bernardin, a Catholic Cardinal. The ideology is based on all life being important, and that it should be protected by law. == Related pages == * Pro-life * Life * Natalism == References == == Other websites == * Consistent Life Network Category:Philosophy Category:Religion",
