 "text": "The sixteenth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who is upcoming TV series produced by BBC in collaboration with Sony's Bad Wolf and Disney Branded Television for streaming on Disney. This series is also known as \"Season Three\" following the production changes and the acquisition of Doctor Who's international broadcasting rights by Disney+ prior to the previous series. It will be the seventh series led by Russell T Davies as head writer and executive producer and the third since his return to the show in 2023, while Ncuti Gatwa's future is unknown. == Description == A third series with Davies as showrunner was being planned by November 2023. By the following June, Davies was working on the series' fourth script, despite it not yet having been commissioned, with recording initially expected to begin in early 2025. Gatwa made similar claims regarding a filming schedule in an episode of The Graham Norton Show, but these comments were edited out prior to public broadcast. The BBC later said an official decision on future series would be made after the fifteenth series was transmitted, while also mentioning the original contract with Disney+ was for 26 episodes. The future of the programme as a whole, as well as Disney's involvement with it, has been widely speculated. If produced, it is reported a sixteenth series would likely not air until 2027 at the earliest. Shortly before series 15 aired, Davies, on the CBBC show, Newsround, suggested any hiatus, if it were to occur, would likely be lengthy, stating, \"Sometimes there might be a pause, and during that pause, the viewers of Newsround now will grow up a few years and start writing stories and theyâ€™ll bring it back\". In late 2024, it was announced that a new actor will takeover from Gatwa from series 16. == Cast == === Main === * TBC as The Sixteenth Doctor * Varada Sethu as Belinda Chandra",
