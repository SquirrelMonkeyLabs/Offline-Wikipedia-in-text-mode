 "text": "The Mozambican Civil War was a civil war fought in Mozambique from 1977 to 1992. Like many regional African wars during the late twentieth century, the Mozambican Civil War was affected by the Cold War politics. The war was fought between Mozambique's ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) and insurgent forces of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO). he Mozambican Civil War destroyed much of Mozambique's rural infrastructure, including hospitals, rail lines, roads, and schools. FRELIMO's security forces and RENAMO insurgents were accused of committing numerous human rights abuses, including using child soldiers and salting a significant percentage of the countryside indiscriminately with land mines. ==References== Category:History of Mozambique Category:Civil wars involving Africa Category:1992 in Africa Category:Cold War Category:1970s conflicts Category:1980s conflicts Category:1990s conflicts Category:1977 in Africa Category:1978 in Africa Category:1979 in Africa",
