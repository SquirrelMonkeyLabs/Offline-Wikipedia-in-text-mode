 "text": "A bud usually occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. They are one way plants can reproduce asexually. They connect with phloem and xylem to get nourishment. Some plants normally develop adventitious buds on their roots. The buds can grow quite a distance from the plant. Shoots that develop from adventitious buds on roots are termed suckers. They occur in many grasses, quaking aspen and creeping thistle. A famous quaking aspen known as the Pando grew from one trunk to 47,000 trunks by adventitious bud formation on a single root system.
