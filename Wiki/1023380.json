 "text": "On 18 June 2023, RV Titan, a submersible operated by OceanGate Inc., went missing in international waters in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The submersible had five people on board. It was on a tourist expedition to view the wreck of RMS Titanic. Communication was lost 1 hour and 45 minutes into its dive to the wreck site. The police were told when it did not come back at the right time later that day. A submersibleâ€™s implosion was caused by the failure of her pressure hull. On 22 June, after nearly 80 hours of searching, a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) discovered a debris field with parts of the Titan around 488 m (1,600 ft) from the bow of the Titanic. The pressure vessel probably broke during or after the implosion, killing all on board instantly. Worries about the safety of the vessel had been talked about before. Search and rescue efforts were carried out by a worldwide team led by the United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, and Canadian Coast Guard. Aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Air National Guard, a Royal Canadian Navy ship. Several commercial and research ships and ROVs also helped with the search. ==References== Category:2023 disasters Category:2020s disasters in North America Category:2023 in Canada Category:Maritime disasters Category:Newfoundland and Labrador Category:June 2023 events",
