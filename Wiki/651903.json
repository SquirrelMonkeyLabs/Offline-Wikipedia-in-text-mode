 "text": "The impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the 36th President of Brazil, began on 2 December 2015 with a petition for her impeachment accepted by Eduardo Cunha, then president of the Chamber of Deputies. It continued into late 2016. Rousseff, more than 12 months into her second four-year term, was charged with criminal administrative misconduct for the federal budget in violation of article 85 of the Constitution of Brazil. Art. 36: Credit operations are forbidden between a state financial institution and the Federal entity which oversees it in the capacity of loan beneficiary. Rousseff was formally impeached on 17 April 2016. On 12 May, the Senate voted to suspend Rousseff's powers for the duration of the trial, and Vice President Michel Temer became acting president. On 31 August 2016, the Senate removed President Rousseff from office by a 61â€“20 vote. Temer was sworn in as the 37th President of Brazil. ==References== Category:2010s in Brazil Category:April 2016 events Dilma Rousseff",
