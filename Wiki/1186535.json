 "text": "Degranville's rocket frog (Anomaloglossus degranvillei) is a frog. It lives in French Guiana. ==Home== These frogs live near rocky streams. Scientists saw the frog about 400 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog inside Parc Amazonien de Guyane. ==Young== The tadpoles grow into frogs while the male frog carries them on his back. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to dig gold out of the ground. Climate change could also hurt this frog. Because it lives high in the hills, it cannot move somewhere colder if its home gets too hot. It would have to climb down to somewhere even hotter first. Scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could have killed many of these frogs. Scientists found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in French Guiana. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
