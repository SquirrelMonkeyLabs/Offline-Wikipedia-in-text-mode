 "text": "White Lion was a rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. Formed in 2020 by American guitarist Kai Warner and Australian bassist Lachlan Colebrook, they later recruited vocalist Parker Nassal. Their raw mixture of Bubblegum Pop and Hard Rock was praised for being unique and one-of-kind. Each member was between 14 and 16 years old. They released a self titled album in 2021, followed by their sophomore release titled \"ROAR\" in 2023 before the departure of Colebrook due to creative differences, the other members followed suit, resulting in their disbandment. White Lion failed to reach mainstream success, mostly due to the member's inability to cooperate with each other. Their albums were taken off streaming platforms in 2024 due to legal disputes, but their music can still be found on SoundCloud and YouTube. Warner still regularly uploads to social media, and has been working on a solo career since early 2023. Colebrook and DeVilliers went on to start the metalcore duo \"The Two Idiots\". ==Albums== *\"White Lion\" (2021) *\"ROAR\" (2023) ==Singles== *\"Love Me Like You Mean It\" (2021) *\"I Wanna Be Yours\" (2021) *\"All of My Love\" (2021) *\"King of the World\" (2021) *\"Mouth for War (Death By Words)\" (2022) *\"Rest In Peace\" (2023) *\"Skies of Avalon\" (2023) *\"American Greed\" (2023) Category:Pop-rock bands Category:Musical groups from Nebraska",
