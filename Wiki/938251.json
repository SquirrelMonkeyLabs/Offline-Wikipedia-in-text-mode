Many killers took inspiration from Harris and Klebold, for example Vladislav Roslyakov the perpetrator of the Kerch Polytechnic College massacre or Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik, the perpetrators of the murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart. Some killers described them as heroes, martyrs or icons. Category:Columbine High School massacre",
