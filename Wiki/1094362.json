 "text": "The Great Replacement is a far-right, racist conspiracy theory that says globalist elites or Jews control mass immigration. It says that immigration is a threat to a nation's existence. The conspiracy theory comes from France, but has also spread to other nations, most notably the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. Supporters often use statistics showing that birth rates are declining among \"white\" people, meaning that the percentage of white people in the population is decreasing. This theory does not acknowledge that immigration has always been present in Europe, and \"white\" people have never even been close to extinction. The theory is mostly used to incite fear. Many far-right mass shooters have believed in the theory, most notably Brenton Tarrant, a white nationalist and ecofascist who killed more than 50 Muslims in two mosques in Christchurch. ==Related pages== *White genocide conspiracy theory *White demographic decline == References == Category:Conspiracy theories",
