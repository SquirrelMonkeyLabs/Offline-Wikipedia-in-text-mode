 "text": "The Hudson Motor Car Company was an American automobile manufacturer, founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1909. They were well known for producing low-priced cars of good quality. They also pioneered safety features in their cars, like dashboard warning lights for oil pressure and generator power. Hudson's production peak was in 1929, with 300,000 cars built in their factories in America, Belgium and England. In 1954, Hudson merged with the Nash-Kelvinator Company, to form American Motors Corporation. American Motors (also known as AMC) became famous for their line of Jeep vehicles (a civilian version of military Jeeps), and later Ramblers, Gremlins, and Pacer cars. AMC was finally bought out by the Chrysler Corporation, which still makes Jeep brand vehicles. ==In popular culture== Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road describes road trips made by Kerouac and his friend Neal Cassady, driving a 1949 Hudson automobile. (Cassady ruined his car, driving cross-country at speeds over 100 miles per hour, without giving the car the maintenance it needed.) ==Gallery== Hudson Super Six Phaeton 1929.jpg|Hudson Super Six Phaeton 1929 Hudson 8 Coupe 1931.jpg|Hudson Series T Coupé 1931 Hudson Terraplane 4-D Sedan 1938.jpg|Hudson Terraplane 4-Door Sedan 1938 Hudson 112 Series 90 Convertible Coupe 1939.jpg|Hudson 112 Series 90 Convertible Coupé 1939 Hudson 112 Touring Sedan 1939.jpg|Hudson 112 Series 90 4-Door Touring Sedan 1939 Hudson Pacemaker Series 91 Coupe 1939.jpg|Hudson Pacemaker Series 91 Coupé 1939 Hudson Business Coupe 1940.jpg|Hudson Business Coupé 1940 Hudson 4-D Sedan 1947.jpg|Hudson 4-Door Sedan 1947 Hudson Hornet Convertible 1951.jpg|Hudson Hornet Convertible 1951 Hudsonb.jpg|Hudson Coupé Hudson Hornet 4-D Sedan 1952.jpg|Hudson Hornet 4-Door Sedan 1952 Namibia Aus Hudson-Terraplane.jpg|Hudson Terraplane 1934, wreck in Namibia Category:American automobile companies Category:1909 establishments in the United States Category:Companies based in Detroit",
