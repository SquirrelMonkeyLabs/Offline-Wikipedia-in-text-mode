It is accompanied by positive feelings. ASMR often starts on the scalp, and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. It is an unusual feeling which has no obvious physical cause. It has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia. People who experience ASMR may feel a \"low-grade euphoria\".A 2018 article describes ASMR as \"a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin\". There are over 13 million videos on YouTube which try to stimulate ASMR. == References == Category:Internet culture Category:Perception Category:Sensory system",
