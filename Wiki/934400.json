 "text": "Homosexual actions, as well as anal and oral sex, are illegal in Guyana. It is currently the only country in South America that prohibits such acts. Engaging in such acts can give life imprisonment, though it is not enforced. These laws can be difficult to change, because Guyana's Constitution protects laws given from the British Empire from constitutional review. However, cross-dressing has been legal since 2018, when a ban was struck down by Guyana's court of last resort, the Caribbean Court of Justice. President David A. Granger (2015â€“2020) expressed support for these efforts. == References == Guyana Category:Guyana",
