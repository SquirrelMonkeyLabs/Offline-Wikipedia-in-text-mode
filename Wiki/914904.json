Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who was President before the election, was elected again, receiving 81% of the vote. His closest challenger, Jiguli Dairabaev of the Auyl Party, received just 3%. In September 2022, during his annual Address to the nation Tokayev made many proposals. Two of the main proposals that were later approved were: holding snap elections in the autumn of 2022 and extending the presidential term from 5 years to 7 years, but banning re-election.
