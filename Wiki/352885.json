 "text": "Memorial van Damme is a yearly athletics event at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels, Belgium. It takes place in late August or early September. Before it was one of the IAAF Golden League events. Now it is now part of the IAAF Diamond League. It was first put together in 1977 by a group of journalists in honour of Ivo van Damme. Damme was a Belgian double medal winner at the Montreal Olympics who was killed in a car accident at the age of 22. A former footballer, he turned to athletics and in particular the 1500 m and 3000 m. Later on, he ran in the 800 m. In 1976, he took part in the Montreal Olympic Games, where he won silver medals in both the 800 m and 1500 m. ==World records== === 2009 === * 4 x 1500 m relay men 14:36.23 Kenya (William Biwott Tanui, Gideon Gathimba, Geoffrey Kipkoech Rono, Augustine Kiprono Choge) === 2006 === * 4 x 800 m relay men 7:02.43 Kenya (Joseph Mutua, William Yiampoy, Ismael Kombich, Wilfred Bungei) === 2005 === * 10,000 m 26:17.53 Kenenisa Bekele, Ethiopia === 2004 === * 10,000 m men Junior 27:04.00 Boniface Kiprop Toroitich, Uganda * 3,000 m steeplechase men 7:53.63 Saif Saaeed Shaheen, Qatar * Pole vault women 4.92 m Yelena Isinbayeva, Russia === 2001 === * 3,000 m men Junior 7:30.67 Kenenisa Bekele, Ethiopia * 3,000 m steeple men 7:55.28 Brahim Boulami, Morocco === 1997 === * 5,000 m men 12:39.74 Daniel Komen, Kenya * 10,000 m men 26:27.85 Paul Tergat, Kenya === 1996 === * 10,000 m men 26:38.08 Salah Hissou, Morocco * 1,000 m women 2:28.98 Svetlana Masterkova, Russia === 1995 === * 5,000 m men Junior 13:07.38 Daniel Komen, Kenya * 1,000 m women 2:29.34 Maria de Lurdes Mutola, Mozambique === 1981 === * 1 mile men 3.47.33 Sebastian Coe, United Kingdom ==Meeting Records== ===Men=== Event Record Athlete Nationality Date Ref Video 100 m 9.76 (+1.3 m/s) Usain Bolt 16 September 2011 200 m 19.26 (+0.7 m/s) Yohan Blake 16 September 2011 400 m 44.06 Michael Johnson 28 August 1998 800 m 1:42.20 Wilson Kipketer 22 August 1997 1000 m 2:14.95 Sammy Koskei 30 August 1985 1500 m 3:26.12 Hicham El Guerrouj 24 August 2001 Mile 3:47.30 Noureddine Morceli 3 September 1993 3000 m 7:23.09 Hicham El Guerrouj 3 September 1999 5000 m 12:39.74 Daniel Komen 22 August 1997 10000 m 26:17.53 Kenenisa Bekele 26 August 2005 110 m hurdles 12.92 (+0.2 m/s) Allen Johnson 23 August 1996 400 m hurdles 47.51 Andre Phillips 5 September 1986 3000 m steeplechase 7:53.63 Saif Saaeed Shaheen 3 September 2004 High jump 2.38 m Hollis Conway 10 August 1990 Pole vault 5.95 m Sergey Bubka Sergey Bubka Jeff Hartwig Jeff Hartwig 19 August 1994 22 August 1997 28 August 1998 3 September 1999 Long jump 8.65 m Carl Lewis 24 August 1984 Triple jump 17.60 m Jonathan Edwards 30 August 1995 Shot put 22.16 m Reese Hoffa 27 August 2010 Discus throw 69.94 m Imrich Bugár 24 August 1984 Hammer throw 82.26 m Lance Deal 23 August 1996 Javelin throw 93.48 m (old design) 90.50 m (Current design) Tom Petranoff Jan Železný 26 August 1983 25 August 1995 4x100 m relay 38.65 United States 19 August 1988 4x800 m relay 7:02.43 Kenya 25 August 2006 4x1500 m relay 14:36.23 William Biwott Tanui Gideon Gathimba Geoffrey Rono Augustine Choge 4 September 2009 ===Women=== Event Record Athlete Nationality Date Ref 100 m 10.76 (+0.9 m/s) Marion Jones 22 August 1997 200 m 21.64 Merlene Ottey 13 September 1991 400 m 48.83 Sanya Richards 4 September 2009 800 m 1.55.16 Pamela Jelimo 6 September 2008 1000 m 2:28.98 Svetlana Masterkova 23 August 1996 1500 m 3.55.33 Süreyya Ayhan 5 September 2003 Mile 4.17.75 Maryam Yusuf Jamal 14 September 2007 2000 m 5:30.19 Gelete Burka 4 September 2009 3000 m 8.24.81+ Meseret Defar 14 September 2007 Two miles 8.58.58 Meseret Defar 14 September 2007 5000 m 14.25.43 Vivian Cheruiyot 6 September 2008 100 m hurdles 12.42 Yordanka Donkova 5 September 1986 400 m hurdles 53.43 Nezha Bidouane 28 August 1998 3000 m steeplechase 9:15.43 Yuliya Zaripova 16 September 2011 High jump 2.05 m Anna Chicherova 16 September 2011 Pole vault 4.93 m Yelena Isinbayeva 26 August 2005 Long jump 7.25 m Heike Drechsler 13 September 1991 Triple jump 15.14 m (+0.3 m/s) Tatyana Lebedeva 5 September 2003 Shot put 20.57 m Natalya Lisovskaya 11 September 1987 Discus throw 69.84 m Tsvetanka Christova 5 September 1986 Javelin throw 72.18 m (old design) 67.76 m (Current design) Fatima Whitbread Trine Hattestad 5 September 1986 25 August 2000 4x100 m relay 42.97 United States 19 August 1988 \\+ = en route to a longer distance ==References== ==Other websites== * Diamond League – Brussels Official Web Site Category:Sport in Belgium Category:Brussels Category:1977 establishments in Europe Category:1970s establishments in Belgium",
