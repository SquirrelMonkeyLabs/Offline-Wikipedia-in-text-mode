 "text": "Duellmanohyla or mountain brook frogs is a group of frogs in the family Hylidae. These frogs live in Oaxaca, Mexico and in Central America. These are small frogs that lay eggs in streams. ==Description== Duellmanohyla are small frogs. Their eyes are bright red, bronze, or yellow. Their stomachs are pale green, olive, red-brown, or patterned like lichen: green spots on black. Some of these frogs have stripes on their mouths and the sides of the bodies. Some of them have webbed feet and some do not. ==Ecology== Duellmanohyla lay eggs in mountain streams where the water moves fast. Because they swim, they have some webbing on their front feet and on some of the toes of their back feet. Scientists have not seen any of the frogs lay eggs, but they think the female frogs lay eggs on the plants above the water. Then the tadpoles fall into the stream. The tadpoles have dangling oral discs that they use to hold on to the bottom of the stream. ==Species== The genus has eight species: Binomial name and author Common name D. chamulae Chamula mountain brook frog D. ignicolor Sierra Juarez brook frog D. lythrodes Savage's brook frog D. rufioculis Rufous-eyed brook frog D. salvavida Honduran brook frog D. schmidtorum Schmidt's mountain brook frog D. soralia Copan brook frog D. uranochroa Costa Rica brook frog ==References== Category:Frogs Category:Frogs of North America",
