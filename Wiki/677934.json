 "text": "Lessemsauridae is a clade of early sauropod dinosaurs that lived in the Triassic and Jurassic of Argentina and South Africa. The phylogenetic analysis performed by Apaldetti and colleagues is shown below: ==Species== ===Antetonitrus=== someone please add info for antetonitrus ===Ingentia=== Not to be confused with the nematode Ingenia Ingentia is an early sauropod dinosaur from the Late Triassic of Argentina. The type specimen of Ingentia, PVSJ 1086, was discovered in the Quebrada del Barro Formation of northwestern Argentina. The only species, Ingentia prima, meaning \"first huge one\", as the taxon was one of the first very large sauropodomorphs to evolve, along with its close relative Lessemsaurus. A second specimen, PVSJ 1087, was referred, containing five tail vertebrae, both the radius and ulna, a left calfbone and a right foot. ===Ledumahadi=== Ledumahadi (meaning \"a giant thunderclap\" in Sesotho language) is a sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic. A quadruped, it was one of the first giant sauropodomorphs, reaching a weight of around , despite not having evolved columnar limbs like its later huge relatives. ===Lessemsaurus=== Lessemsaurus is an extinct genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Triassic period. It is unusual because it lived about 30 million years before the long-necked plant-eaters Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus lived. The type species, L. sauropoides, was formally described by José Bonaparte in 1999. It was found in the Los Colorados Formation of La Rioja Province, Argentina.Weishampel, David B; et al., 2004. \"Dinosaur distribution (Late Triassic, South America).\" In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osmólska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 527–528. . This dinosaur was around long and was discovered in strata dating to the Norian stage, around 210 million years ago. Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh said: :\"What is really unexpected is that the lessemsaurids achieved their huge bodies independently of the gigantic sauropods like Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, which did indeed evolve later during the Jurassic. The development of huge size wasn't just a one-off event for the sauropods, but rather different types of dinosaurs were able to become colossal\".BBC News Science & Environment ==References== Category:Sauropods Category:Triassic dinosaurs Category:Jurassic dinosaurs Category:Dinosaurs of South America Category:Dinosaurs of Africa",
