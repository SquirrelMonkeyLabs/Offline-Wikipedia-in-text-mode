 "text": "Procoptodon is a genus of giant short-faced kangaroo living in Australia during the Pleistocene epoch. P. goliah was the largest kangaroo known to have existed. It stood about tall. They weighed about . Other members of the genus were smaller. Procoptodon gilli was the smallest of the genus, only about tall. They were browsers, not grazers like kangaroos today. They ate leaves from trees and shrubs. Their weight makes it likely that they did not hop as their relatives do today.Janis CM; Buttrill K. & Figueirido B. 2014. Locomotion in extinct giant kangaroos: were sthenurines hop-less monsters?\". PLoS ONE. 9 (10): e109888. A combination of climate change (cooling and shrinking of forest areas) would have reduced their natural habitat. Predation (hunting) by aboriginal humans probably happened.Prideaux G.J. et al 2009. Extinction implications of a chenopod browse diet for a giant Pleistocene kangaroo. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 106 (28): 11646–11650. doi:10.1073/pnas.0900956106. Saltbushes were their main food source, so Procoptodon goliah relied on free-standing water to help process its salt-laden diet.Field, Judith and Wroe, Stephen. 2012.Aridity, faunal adaptations and Australian late Pleistocene extinctions.
