 "text": "Chicken fingers (also known as chicken tenders, chicken tendies, chicken strips, or chicken goujons) are chicken meat dipped in breading and then deep- fried, grilled or baked. In the Northeastern United States or the Midwest, chicken strips are often made by way of egg batter and have smooth texture. Elsewhere, however, chicken strips may lack egg batter and the texture can be rather coarse. Chicken strips are provided to customers in certain restaurants, including the KFC, McDonald's and Wendy's fast food networks. Category:American food Category:Chicken as food Category:Fast food",
