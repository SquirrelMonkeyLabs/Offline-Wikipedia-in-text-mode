 "text": "The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (, Çumhuriji Şūraviji Sotsialistiji Toçikiston; , Tadžikskaja Sovetskaja Socialističeskaja Respublika), also commonly known as Soviet Tajikistan and Tajik SSR, was one of the republics of the Soviet Union which lasted from 1929 to 1991. Nowadays known as Tajikistan, which became a sovereign state after the fall of the Soviet Union, it is located in the southern mountaineous region of Central Asia. The Tajik Republic was created on 5 December 1929 as a national place for the Tajik people within the Soviet Union. It succeeded the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik ASSR), which had been created on 14 October 1924 as a part of the mainly Turkic Uzbek SSR in the process of national delimitation in Soviet Central Asia. On 24 August 1990, the Tajik SSR declared sovereignty in its borders and was renamed the \"Republic of Tajikistan\" on 31 August 1991, then finally declaring independence from the Soviet Union just a bit more than a week after. Just like modern-day Tajikistan, it was bordered by Afghanistan to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kirghizia to the north, and China to the east. Pakistan was to its south, separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor.
