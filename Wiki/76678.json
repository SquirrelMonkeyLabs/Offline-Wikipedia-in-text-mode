 "text": "Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering dealing with chemistry that came to existence in the early 20th century.From Petroleum to Penicillin. The First Hundred Years of Modern Chemical Engineering: 1859–1959. – Burnett, J. N. Before this time, chemical plants were designed by chemists, who were trained to work on a small scale only. A chemical engineer typically works in the design and supervision of chemical manufacturing processes. Chemical engineers may use their skills to solve problems in the production systems of food, medicine, leather, as well as in refineries. Chemical engineering combines the jobs of a chemist and that of industrial engineer. This makes factories more efficient and chemicals much cheaper as they can be produced for less money. Optimization is a technique used for this. Chemical engineering uses physics (the science of moving objects and forces), chemistry (the science of substances), and mathematics. There are many different types of jobs for people with degrees in chemical engineering. Some new topics in chemical engineering include: * environmental sanitation at factories (making certain that nature is not hurt by the factories); * developing types of energy other than those from gas or oil; * biomedical engineering. * hydrogen processing ==Notes == Category:Branches of chemistry Category:Engineering disciplines",
