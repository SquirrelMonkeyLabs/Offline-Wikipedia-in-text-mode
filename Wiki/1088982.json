 "text": "Paranormal means phenomena that lie outside the scope of what is considered normal or explainable by current scientific understanding. These phenomena often challenge our conventional understanding of the physical world and may involve occurrences that seem to transcend or defy natural laws. Belief in the paranormal varies widely, with some individuals embracing these ideas as evidence of a reality beyond the material world, while others approach them with skepticism and seek scientific explanations. While there are many anecdotal accounts of paranormal experiences, the scientific community generally requires empirical evidence and rigorous testing to accept phenomena as valid and reliable. == Examples == Common examples of paranormal phenomena include: # Ghosts and Spirits: Apparitions or manifestations of entities believed to be the souls or spirits of the deceased. # UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects): Unexplained aerial phenomena that some people believe to be evidence of extraterrestrial visitation. # Telekinesis: The ability to move or manipulate objects without physical contact, using only the mind. # Telepathy: The transmission of thoughts or information from one person to another without the use of known senses. # Clairvoyance: The ability to perceive information about events or locations beyond normal human sensory perception. # Precognition: The ability to foresee or predict future events before they occur. It's essential to distinguish between personal beliefs, cultural folklore, and scientific inquiry when exploring the realm of the paranormal. While some experiences may remain unexplained or mysterious, the scientific method remains a crucial tool for investigating and understanding the world around us.
