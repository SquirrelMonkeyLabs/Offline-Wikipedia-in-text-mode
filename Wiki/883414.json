 "text": "The 2020 United States presidential election in Mississippi took place on November 3, just like the national election. In this election, incumbent Republican president Donald Trump of New York and Vice-President Mike Pence of Indiana, ran against the Democratic candidates: former Vice-President Joe Biden of Delaware, and running mate Senator Kamala Harris of California. Harris was both the first Asian-American and African-American nominated for vice president by one of the major parties. Mississippi has a total of 6 electoral votes in the Electoral College (there are 538 altogether). Although Biden and Harris won nationally with 306 electoral votes, Mississippi went Republican, giving Donald Trump 57.6% of the vote (756, 764 raw votes) compared to 41.1% of the vote for Joe Biden (539,398 raw votes). This means Trump got all 6 electoral votes. Although Biden improved on Hillary Clinton's performance four years previously, he still lost the state. Mississippi has not supported a Democrat for president since 1976. == References == Category:2020 United States presidential election Category:2020s in Mississippi",
