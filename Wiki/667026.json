 "text": "Islam is the second largest religion in India. In 2017, India had 189,000,000 Muslims (followers of Islam). India ranks third of the top list countries which have largest Muslim population, after Indonesia and Pakistan. Most Muslims in India follow the Sunni branch, while about 15% are Shia. Islam first reached India along the Arab coastal trade routes in Gujarat and the Malabar Coast, soon after it began in the Arabian Peninsula. It later spread inland when Arab forces conquered Sindh in the 7th century, and it reached Punjab and North India in the 12th century through the conquests by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids. Since then, Islam has become an important part of India's religious and cultural heritage. Some of the earliest mosques in India were built by Arab traders. For example, the Barwada Mosque in Ghogha, Gujarat was built before 623 CE; the Cheraman Juma Mosque in Methala, Kerala was built in 629 CE; and the Palaiya Jumma Palli (also called The Old Jumma Masjid) in Kilakarai, Tamil Nadu was built between 628 and 630 CE.Prof. Mehboob Desai,Masjit during the time of Prophet Nabi Muhammed Sale Allahu Alayhi Wasalam, Divy Bhasakar, Gujarati News Paper, Thursday, column 'Rahe Roshan', 24 May, page 4. According to a local legend, the first mosque in India was built in 624 CE at Kodungallur in present-day Kerala. This mosque was built by the order of the last ruler of the Chera dynasty, who converted to Islam during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (c. 570–632). Similarly, some Tamil Muslims believe that their ancestors converted to Islam during Muhammad’s lifetime. The local mosques in these areas date back to the early 700s. ==Related pages== *Islam in the world ==References== Category:Islam in India",
