 "text": "Trostianets (also Trostyanets; Ukrainian: Тростянець) is a city in the Sumy Oblast in Ukraine, and serves as the administrative center of the Trostianets Raion. Many were killed and the city was badly damaged during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Trostianets was a settlement in the Akhtyrka Uyezd. It arose in the first half of the 17th century, during a new wave of migration of peasants and Cossacks from the Right-bank Ukraine to Sloboda Ukraine. The name of the city is associated with the name of the river Trostyanka, which flows nearby. During World War II, the city was occupied by Axis troops from October 1941 to August 1943. In January 1989 the population was 25,706 people.Тростянец // Большой энциклопедический словарь (в 2-х тт.). / редколл., гл. ред. А. М. Прохоров. том 2. М., \"Советская энциклопедия\", 1991.
