Veterans' associations give out poppies for charitable donations used to give financial, social and emotional support to members and veterans of the armed forces. They were inspired by the war poem \"In Flanders Fields\". They were first used near the end of World War I to honor British Empire and United States military deaths of the war. ==References== Category:Symbols",
