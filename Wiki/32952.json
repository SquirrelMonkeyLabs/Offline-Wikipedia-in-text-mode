 "text": "Windows 3.x is a no-longer supported family of Microsoft Windows operating system, released in 1990-1994. Notable operating systems in this family include Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1. This Windows could run in either Standard or 386 Enhanced memory modes. Both of the modes used a Graphical User Interface (or picture-based), and supported a mouse, but 386 Enhanced Mode was faster and was better at multitasking (or doing many things at once). Windows NT 3.x was released in 1993-1996. It also had many features from versions of Windows before it. These included a calculator, a notepad, and more. It also brought in many new features, like the Program Manager (which is still in Windows XP today - Start>Run>progman.exe), and the icons and programs looked better. Windows 3.x was made better in 1992, with Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (1992-1993), that added networking support. Category:Microsoft operating systems",
