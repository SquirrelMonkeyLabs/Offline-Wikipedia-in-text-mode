 "text": "Triveni Sangam is a place in India where three rivers meet. It is very important in Hinduism because bathing at this place is believed to wash away sins and free a person from the cycle of rebirth. == Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj == The most famous Triveni Sangam is in Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad) in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Here, the rivers Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati meet. The water of the Ganges is clear, the Yamuna looks greenish, and the Saraswati is said to be invisible. This Sangam is an important site for the Kumbh Mela, a big religious event held every 12 years. Many ashes of famous leaders, like Mahatma Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have been immersed here. == Other Triveni Sangams in India == === Gir Somnath === In Gujarat, another Triveni Sangam is near the Somnath temple in Gir Somnath district.
