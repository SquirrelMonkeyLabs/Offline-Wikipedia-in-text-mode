Due to constitutional term limits, which restrict the President of the Republic to serving only two terms, the incumbent President Andrzej Duda, is not eligible for reelection. Presidential elections in Poland must be held on a day off work (Sunday or public holiday) between 75 and 100 days before the end of the term. However, they may be held earlier if the office becomes vacant due to the death, resignation, or removal of the incumbent. ==Electoral system== The president is elected for a five-year term using a two-round system; if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round, a runoff election is held between the two candidates with the most votes. Presidents serve a five-year term and can be re-elected once. Andrzej Duda's second term expires on August 6, 2025, and the president-elect will be sworn in that day before the National Assembly (a joint session of the Sejm and Senate). == Candidates == ===Registered candidates=== Name Born Campaign Last position/job Party Endorsed by Artur Bartoszewicz () Suwałki, Podlaskie Lecturer at the Collegium of Socio-Economics of the Warsaw School of Economics Independent Magdalena Biejat () Warsaw, Mazovia Deputy Marshal of the Senate (2023–present) Member of the Sejm (2019–2023) Senator (2023–present) Independent The Left Grzegorz Braun () Toruń, Kuyavia–Pomerania Leader of the Confederation of the Polish Crown (2019–) Member of the Sejm (2019–2024) MEP for Lesser Poland (2024–present) 2015 presidential election candidate rowspan=\"4\" Confederation of the Polish Crown Congress of the New Right KORWiN PolExit Real Europe Movement Szymon Hołownia () Białystok, Podlaskie Marshal of the Sejm (2023–present) Member of the Sejm (2023–present) Leader of Poland 2050 (2021–present) 2020 presidential election candidate Poland 2050 Third Way Marek Jakubiak () Warsaw, Mazovia Leader of (2018–present) Member of the Sejm (2015–2019, 2023–present) 2020 presidential election candidate Entrepreneur and brewer Free Republicans Maciej Maciak () Włocławek, Kuyavia-Pomerania Leader of RDiP (2023–present) Journalist, youtuber Independent Prosperity and Peace Movement Sławomir Mentzen () Toruń, Kuyavia–Pomerania Chairman of New Hope (2022–present) Member of the Sejm (2023–present) Entrepreneur and tax advisor New Hope Confederation Karol Nawrocki () Gdańsk, Pomerania President of the Institute of National Remembrance (2021–present) Director of the Museum of the Second World War (2017–2021) Chairman of the Siedlce District Council in Gdańsk (2011–2017) rowspan=\"2\" Independent United Right United Beyond Boundaries Joanna Senyszyn () Gdynia, Pomerania Member of the Sejm (2001–2009, 2019–2023) MEP for Lesser Poland (2009–2014) rowspan=\"2\" Independent Democratic Left Association Nonpartisans Krzysztof Stanowski () Warsaw, Mazovia Journalist, youtuber Kanał Zero and KTS Weszło owner Independent Rafał Trzaskowski () Warsaw, Mazovia Mayor of Warsaw (2018–present) Vice-Chairman of the Civic Platform (2020–present) 2020 presidential election second round Civic Platform Civic Coalition Alliance of Democrats Marek Woch () Kąkolewnica, Lublin Leader of the Bezpartyjni Samorządowcy (2024–present) Bezpartyjni Samorządowcy Labour Party Slavic Union Adrian Zandberg () Aalborg, Denmark Co-leader of Partia Razem (2022–present) Member of the Sejm (2019–present) Partia Razem == Opinion polls == ==Notes== == References == Category:2025 elections in Europe 2025 presidential election Category:May 2025 events 2025 presidential election",
