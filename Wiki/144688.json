 "text": "Netbook, the word made by Intel company in February 2008, means smaller version of a regular laptop. Netbooks are known for being small and easy to move around. It is a kind of computer that does basic jobs like web surfing and word processing. Netbook device is normally built for CPU that uses lower power, like the Intel Atom. Now there are many netbooks such as hp-mini and Asus Eee PC. More than 50 million netbooks will be released by 2011. == History == The concept of netbook is originated from subnotebooks. The word Netbook was introduced by Psion in 1999http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 and introduced again by Intel in 2008. In 2007, Asus present the ASUS Eee PC range running a Linux on a 7 inch color screen. Soon after their appearance, netbooks grew in size and features, and converged with smaller laptops and subnotebooks. The Eee PC has been a top seller on Amazon.com and is often sold out in stores. The Eee's success is attributed to the relatively low-price (around $350/£230/€300) compared with standard-sized laptops. (above $1000 at that time) In middle of February 2008, Everex released its VIA chipset based on CloudBook, running gOS. Unlike its rival, the Eee PC, the CloudBook uses a hard-disk. In June 2008, MSI launched the MSI Wind PC, with features such as Bluetooth and a 10\" LED, backlit, 1024x600 screen. This new laptop is the first built with Intel Atom low power technology and competes with the HP 2133 Mini-Note PC which has a 8.9\" screen.http://global.msi.com.tw/index.php?func=prodpage2&maincat;_no=135&cat2;_no=582 MSIhttp://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-321838-306995-3687084.html HP == References == Category:Laptops",
