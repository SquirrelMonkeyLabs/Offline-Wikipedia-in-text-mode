 "text": "The People of ‘Ad The people of ‘Ad were a powerful and prosperous tribe that lived in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in a region known as Al-Ahqaf (the Sandy Plains). They were known for their impressive structures and architectural skills. However, despite their material success, they were arrogant, idol-worshippers, and had turned away from the worship of the One True God. Hud’s Prophethood God chose Hud as a prophet to guide the people of ‘Ad back to the path of monotheism. Hud was a member of the ‘Ad tribe, which allowed him to speak directly to his people and warn them of their wrongdoing. He called them to worship God alone, abandon their idols, and follow the righteous path. Hud’s Message Prophet Hud’s message was simple and clear. He reminded the people of ‘Ad of the blessings God had bestowed upon them and warned them against their arrogance and disbelief. He urged them to repent and seek forgiveness from God to avoid divine punishment. The Quran narrates Hud’s plea to his people in Surah Hud (11:50-60) and Surah Al-A’raf (7:65-72), emphasizing his efforts to guide them: “And to ’Aad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said, ‘O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventors [of falsehood]. O my people, I do not ask you for it any reward. My reward is only from the one who created me. Then will you not reason? And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. And do not turn away, [being] criminals.’” (Quran 11:50-52) . The Response of the People Despite Hud’s persistent efforts, the people of ‘Ad largely rejected his message. They mocked him, accusing him of being foolish and possessed. They were confident in their strength and prosperity and did not believe that they could be punished. The Punishment As the people of ‘Ad continued in their disbelief and defiance, God decided to punish them. The Quran describes how a devastating windstorm was sent to destroy them. This windstorm, described as a “furious wind,” lasted for seven nights and eight days, annihilating the entire tribe except for Hud and the few believers who had heeded his warning: “And as for ‘Aad, they were destroyed by a screaming, violent wind, which He imposed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so you would see the people therein fallen as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees.” (Quran 69:6-7) . Legacy of Hud Prophet Hud’s story serves as a lesson in the Quran about the consequences of arrogance, disbelief, and the rejection of divine guidance. His perseverance and dedication to delivering God’s message, despite facing immense opposition, highlight the qualities of true prophethood and devotion to God’s will. Hud is remembered as a prophet who exemplified patience, faith, and steadfastness in the face of adversity. His story, like those of other prophets, is a reminder of the importance of monotheism, repentance, and obedience to God. References: 1\\. The Quran, Surah Hud (11:50-52). 2\\.
