 "text": "The history of Australia from 1901 to 1945 begins with the federation of the six colonies to create the Commonwealth of Australia. == Federation and early policies == Australia became a nation on January 1, 1901, when six colonies united to form the Commonwealth of Australia. The new government focused on laws about immigration, introducing the White Australia Policy, which restricted non-European migration. Early efforts also established workers’ rights, such as the eight-hour workday and social welfare programs like pensions. == World War I (1914–1918) == Australia joined World War I as part of the British Empire, contributing soldiers to major battles like Gallipoli and the Western Front. Over 60,000 Australians died, and the war had a significant impact on the nation's economy and society. Anzac Day was established to honor these sacrifices. == The Interwar Period (1919–1939) == After the war, Australia focused on nation-building, including infrastructure projects like the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Great Depression of the 1930s caused widespread unemployment and hardship. Political divisions grew between the Australian Labor Party and conservative groups, shaping debates about economic policies and workers' rights. == World War II (1939–1945) == Australia entered World War II in support of Great Britain in 1939. After Japan's entry into the war in 1941, Australia became a key ally of the United States. The war brought battles closer to home, including attacks on Darwin and the defense of Papua New Guinea. It marked a shift in Australia's reliance from Britain to closer ties with the U.S. Category:History of Australia Category:20th century in Australia",
