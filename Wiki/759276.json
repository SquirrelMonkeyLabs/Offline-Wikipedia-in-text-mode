After a few days, both her parents were found positive for Coronavirus as well. Malta has reported 1862 confirmed cases, 1313 recoveries and 11 deaths; 538 cases remain active. A mandatory quarantine was forced on travelers and those who were possibly in contact with those who traveled abroad. A mandatory lockdown was imposed on those over the age of 65, those suffering from chronic health conditions and members of their households. WHO praised the Maltese government's response to the pandemic, before the number of cases rose to 52 on 7 April. On May Day, given that the rate of the virus was below 0, the first reopening measures were announced. ==References== Category:Malta Malta",
