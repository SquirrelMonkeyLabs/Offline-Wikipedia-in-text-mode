 "text": "Ratha Yatra (), also known as the chariot festival, is an annual religious procession where deities, most commonly Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra, are paraded on grand wooden chariots (rathas) through the streets. The most famous Ratha Yatra takes place in Puri, Odisha, at the Jagannath Temple, and is celebrated by millions of devotees.http://rathyatralive.com/ahmedabad-rath- jatra-jamalpur-jagannath-temple/48/ The term Ratha Yatra comes from two Sanskrit words: Ratha (chariot) and Yatra (pilgrimage or journey). The festival typically occurs during the month of Ashadha (Juneâ€“July), with significant celebrations in Puri, as well as in places like Ahmedabad, Bangladesh, and Nepal. In addition, Hindu communities in countries like Singapore and the UK also organize similar processions. == Significance == Ratha Yatra is a joyous event where deities leave the sanctum of their temples, symbolizing their visit to the devotees and the world outside. The festival brings together large communities to celebrate, marking its cultural and religious importance. The chariots are decorated elaborately, and the procession is accompanied by singing, dancing, and chanting by the devotees. The Puri Ratha Yatra has inspired the English term \"juggernaut,\" referring to an unstoppable force due to the sheer size and momentum of the chariots. == Historical references == Medieval Indian texts, such as the Puranas, mention Ratha Yatra celebrations for various deities, including Surya (the Sun god), Devi (the Mother goddess), and Vishnu. Fa-Hien, a Chinese traveler who visited India in the 5th century CE, described the grandeur of these processions. == References == Category:Hindu festivals",
