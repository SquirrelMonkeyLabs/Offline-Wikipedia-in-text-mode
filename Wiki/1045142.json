 "text": "Uhtam's bush frog (Raorchestes uthamani) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place, near a cardamom farm in Gavi, 1000 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog near bamboo plants in evergreen forests. Sometimes people find them on cardamom farms. People have seen this frog between 900 and 1100 meters above sea level. The female frog lays her eggs in bamboo plants. Scientists think this frog is at some danger of dying out because it only lives in a few places, but two of those places are protected parks: Periyar Tiger Reserve and Anamalai Tiger Reserve. If people stopped protecting the parks, the frog would be in more danger. The frog may be in some danger from people cutting down bamboo plants to use themselves. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can also make this frog sick. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
