 "text": "The Chiappa Rhino is a revolver. It fires bullets from the bottom of the cylinder. This is different from most other revolvers, which fire from the top of the cylinder. This allows the Rhino to shoot even powerful bullets, like the .357 Magnum, with little recoil. As a result, the Rhino also has high accuracy and high rate of fire. The Rhino is named after the rhinoceros because it looks somewhat like a rhinoceros's head. Most models shoot the .357 Magnum (as well as the .38 Special), but there are also models that shoot the 9x19mm Parabellum or the S&W; .40. Due to its futuristic look, it is often shown in science-fiction movies like the live-action Ghost in the Shell, Terminator: Dark Fate, and the remake of Total Recall. ==References== Category:Revolvers",
