 "text": "The Chords Bridge (, Gesher HaMeitarim), also called the Bridge of Strings or Jerusalem Light Rail Bridge, is a bridge for the Jerusalem Light Rail. It is at the western entrance to Jerusalem next to the Central Bus Station and the Jerusalem Binyanei HaUma Railway Station. The bridge was designed by the Spanish architect and structural engineer Santiago Calatrava. The bridge was opened in 2008, three years before the new light rail started in the city. ==References== == Other websites == * Bridges, string art and BÃ©zier curves -- mathematical analysis of the shape.
