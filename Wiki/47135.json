 "text": "Pumpkin Studios was a video game studio founded in 1996 in Bath, England that is infamous for only developing a single game. Their game: Warzone 2100, is a real-time strategy game developed for PC and PlayStation. The game used many ideas that were new at the time such as machines that use radio waves to find other objects (radar technology) and machines that shoot objects (artillery). The game also used movies to tell the story to the player. These movies are called full motion videos, better known in the gaming community as cutscenes. Not much else is known about the company as they disbanded not long after their formation in March of 2000. == Other websites == *Pumpkin Studios, MobyGames *Pumpkin Studios website (no longer used) *Warzone 2100 website Category:Video game companies of the United Kingdom Category:Bath, Somerset Category:1996 establishments in England Category:2000 disestablishments in Europe Category:2000s disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:20th- century disestablishments in England",
