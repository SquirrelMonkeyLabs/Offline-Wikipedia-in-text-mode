 "text": "Tony Hawk's Project 8 is a skateboarding video game. It was published by Activision and was developed by Neversoft. It is the eighth game in the Tony Hawk's series. It was released on November 7, 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360. It was also released on November 17, 2006 for the PlayStation 3 and on November 21, 2006 for the PlayStation Portable. It would be released later in January 2007 for Mobile. In the game, Tony Hawk starts a new skating team called Project 8. The player creates a skater and tries to build their rank by doing objectives while skating around the town. The goal is to get from the starting rank of #200 to become one of the top 8 so they can join Hawk's team. The next gen consoles have a open world free roam where players can skate all around the town. It also features an entirely new game engine. The older gen versions do not have the open world and the levels have to be individually selected. ==Reception== The game was liked by game critics. Critics said that they liked the graphics, the career mode, and new modes like the Nail the Trick mode. However, they did not like that features were taken out from the last games, that the framerate for the PS3 version had issues, and the creation options for creating a skater were limited. Tony Hawk's Project 8 won Sports Game of the Year at the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. ==References== Category:2006 video games Category:Tony Hawk video games Category:Activision video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Neversoft games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Single-player video games Category:Skateboarding video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in France Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox 360 games",
