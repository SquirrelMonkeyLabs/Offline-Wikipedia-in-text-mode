 "text": "Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (; born 5 December 1985) is an Emirati sheikha and a member of the Dubai ruling family. Her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, and her mother, Huriah Ahmed al M'aash is from Algeria. She has two half-sisters with the same name. Sheikha Latifa escaped from Dubai in late February 2018 and was forcibly returned from international waters near the Indian coast by a joint Indiaâ€“Emirates operation on 4 March 2018. In December 2018, the Dubai royal court said that she was back in Dubai. She was believed to be held against her will under the order of her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. In August 2021 and after Latifa had been photographed in public places in Dubai, Spain and Iceland, the #FreeLatifa campaign, which had lasted three and a half years, came to an end when she was allowed to leave Dubai. In February 2022, it was reported she was living in Paris, France. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Emirati people",
