It tells the story of a black Sheriff, played by Little, who is appointed Sheriff of a small Western town and how he must try to make friends with the racist towns people and stop a ruthless businessman from knocking down the town to make way for a railway line. While the movie is widely said to be a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the movie was first released.
