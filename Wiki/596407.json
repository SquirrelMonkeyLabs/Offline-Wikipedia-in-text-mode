In June 2017 after seven months of not receiving a response from Pope Francis to their request that he clarify highly disputed parts in his apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), four cardinals asked the Holy Father for an audience in April but the Pope has yet to respond. In an April 25 letter hand- delivered to the Holy Father on May 6, Cardinals Carlo Caffarra, Brandmüller, Raymond Burke and Joachim Meisner wrote to Francis asking for an audience, having received no response to the dubia they sent him on Sept 2016. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:Living people Category:German cardinals Category:People from Bavaria Category:German Roman Catholic bishops",
