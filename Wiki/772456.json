Above the station are Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. The B and D trains are express trains, so that means they go on express tracks. The F and M trains are local trains, so they go on local tracks. When you exit the station, you can see the Bank of America Tower on 6th Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets. Sometimes, E trains and other trains enter this station via 6th Avenue to World Trade Center or Jamaica Center or other stations.
