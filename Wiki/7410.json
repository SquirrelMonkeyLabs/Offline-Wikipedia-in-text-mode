 "text": "A Muslim is a person who believes in Islam, an Abrahamic monotheistic religion. Islam is a monotheistic religion from Abrahamic beginnings. Muslims believe the Qur'an is a book of the words that the God of Abraham (or Allah) gave to the Prophet Muhammad. Alongside the Qur'an, Muslims also believe in previous revelations of God, such as the Tawrat (Torah), the Zabur (Psalms), the Injeel (Gospel), the Scrolls of Abraham, and the Scrolls of Moses. Muslims believe human beings will be judged for how they lived on the Day of Judgement by Allah. Muslim men are usually circumcised. == Muslims around the World == Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Qur'an forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. Muslim conquests following Muhammad's death led to the creation of the Arab caliphates, occupying a vast geographical area. The Islamic conquests culminated in the Arab Empire being established across three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe). Today, there are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, which is about 1 person in every 4 people. The Muslim population continues to grow. == Related pages == * Islam * Islamic state * Non-denominational Muslims * Arabs * Caliphate * Umayyad Caliphate == References == ==Other websites== *Ritual Prayer: Its Meaning and Manner – The Islamic Supreme Council of America. *Muhammad and the First Muslim Ummah – University of Chicago * Islamophobia Today Newspaper – An Islamophobia news clearing house * Sammy Aziz Rahmatti, Understanding and Countering Islamophobia *WikiSaurus:Muslim * *",
