 "text": "In political science, a wave election is one in which a political party wins a lot more than the other. In the United States, there is no agreement of how many wins are needed to be called a wave election. Congressional incumbents in the United States have an advantage over challengers, but a wave election often helps challengers. This results in many more incumbents losing than usual during wave elections. ==Related pages== * Landslide victory ==References== Category:Elections in the United States",
