 "text": "Talakhamani was a Nubian King of Meroë during the second half of the 5th century BCE. No prenomen is known, and his nomen is Talakhamani. He may have been a son of Nasakhma and a younger brother of Malewiebamani.Dows Dunham and M. F. Laming Macadam, Names and Relationships of the Royal Family of Napata, The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 35 (Dec., 1949), pp. 139-149 Alternatively, Talakhamani may have been a son of Malewiebamani.Samia Dafa'alla, Succession in the Kingdom of Napata, 900-300 B.C., The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1993), pp. 167-174 Talakhamani is known from a stela from his chapel which is now in Boston. According to an inscription in Kawa he died in his palace at Meroe. He is said to have been succeeded by Amanineteyerike at the age of 41. Talakhamani's name is etymologically identical with that of King Talakhidamani, who ruled seven centuries later in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD.Claude Rilly (2017), \"New Light on the Royal Lineage in the Last Decades of the Meroitic Kingdom: The inscription of the Temple of Amun at Meroe Found in 2012 by the Sudanese–Canadian Mission\", Sudan and Nubia 21: 144–147 (appendix to \"The Amun Temple at Meroe Revisited\" by Krzysztof Grzymski). ==References== Category:Kushite monarchs Category:5th-century BC monarchs of Kush",
