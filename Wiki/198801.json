Adams' trained purely technical and taught Austin the wrestling moves. Adams' however did not teach Austin anything relating to kayfabe or the business. The first lesson that Austin learned was from Tony Falk, a referee in Austin's 1989 televised World Class debut against a wrestler named Frogman LeBlanc. Falk called spots and helped Austin win the match by pinfall. Austin first competed under his real name but was named \"Steve Austin\" by Memphis booker Dutch Mantell. Austin returned to Dallas and had a feud with Adams, who was managed by Percy Pringle and was led to the ring by Jeannie Adams (Adams' real-life former wife and Austin's girlfriend at the time). During that time, Austin adopted the \"Stunning\" nickname which he also used in WCW.Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.5) ===World Championship Wrestling=== After leaving the USWA in 1990, Austin signed with WCW in 1991. He was first accompanied by a valet named Vivacious VeronicaStone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.85-86) but was later joined by Jeannie Adams who was known as \"Lady Blossom\". A couple weeks before he debuted, Austin was able to defeat Bobby Eaton to win his first WCW World Television Championship on June 3, 1991. Later in that year, he joined Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance.Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.89) On April 27, 1992, Barry Windham defeated Austin in a two out of three falls match to win the WCW Television Championship. Austin won the title back from Windham on May 23. He held the title until he lost the title to Ricky Steamboat on September 2, 1992. The Dangerous Alliance stable broke up a while later. During Halloween Havoc, he replaced Terry Gordy and teamed with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams in a match against Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham for the unified WCW and NWA World Tag Team title.Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.91-93) The match ended in a thirty-minute time limit draw. In January 1993, Austin joined Brian Pillman to form the tag team The Hollywood Blonds. Austin and Pillman defeated Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas on March 3 to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship. The Blonds held the titles for five months. At Clash of the Champions XXIII, Austin and Pillman competed in a two-out-of- three-falls tag team title match against Ric Flair and Arn Anderson. The Blonds were defeated by Flair and Anderson but they were not given the titles because one of the falls was counted by a disqualification. The Blonds were scheduled to defend their title against Anderson and Paul Roma at Clash of the Champions XXIV. Pillman was however injured and was replaced by Steven Regal. Anderson and Roma defeated Austin and Regal at the event. While Pillman was still injured, Austin joined Colonel Robert Parker's Stud Stable. When Pillman returned, he was betrayed by Austin and was defeated in a singles match against Austin at Clash of the Champions XXV. Austin defeated Dustin Rhodes with two straight falls in a two-out-of-three-falls match to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship at Starrcade. On August 24, 1994, Austin lost the championship to Ricky Steamboat. Austin was supposed to have a rematch for the title at Fall Brawl but won the title by forfeit after Steamboat was not able to compete because to a back injury. His reign as champion only lasted minutes when lost to Jim Duggan, who was acting as Steamboat's replacement. The match only lasted thirty-five seconds. He had a rematch against Duggan for the United States Championship at both Halloween Havoc 1994 and Clash of the Champions XXIX but didn't win either matches. After Austin returned from a knee injury in early 1995, he took part in a tournament to crown the new WCW United States Heavyweight title. Austin defeated Duggan in the first round by count-out but lost in the quarterfinals to Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage ===Extreme Championship Wrestling=== When Austin suffered a triceps injury while on a tour of Japan, he was fired by WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff. WCW and Bischoff thought that Austin would not be a 'marketable' wrestler.Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.117–118) After he was fired, Austin expressed his opinion on being fired by Eric Bischoff over the phone as having taken the coward's way out. Bischoff said that he fired Austin because he refused to do a taping in Atlanta. When he heard that Austin was fired, Paul Heyman who ran Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), contacted him. Heyman hired Austin to perform in-ring interviews because Austin was still not recovered from his injury enough to compete.Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.120) Austin's time in ECW helped build his future \"Stone Cold\" persona. He appeared in vignettes which ran down WCW and Bischoff. Some of the more memorable promos that he did involved his then-status as WCW Monday Nitro host by introducing Monday NyQuil. He was also joined by \"Bongo\", (which were a set of bongo drums that were meant to represent Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael) in helping to promote the show \"where the big boys play with each other\" During his time in ECW, he was known under the ring name \"Superstar\" Steve Austin.Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Stone Cold Truth (p.123–125) He feuded with Mikey Whipwreck and had a match with The Sandman. Austin challenged for the ECW Championship but was defeated by Whipwreck at November to Remember. Austin competed in a Triple Threat match at December to Dismember against The Sandman and Whipwreck for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship but he did not win the match. Heyman said later on that he wanted to have Austin win the ECW Championship but Austin did not want to win it because he felt that he was more effective \"as the hunter, rather than the hunted.\" ===World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE=== On March 7, 2022, after many months him insulting Texas, Kevin Owens invited Austin to be a guest on his talk show The KO Show at WrestleMania 38 which Austin later accepted in a video reply. During the show, Owens challenged Austin to a No Holds Barred match which he agreed. The two fought around the arena and Austin won after hitting Owens with the stunner and getting the pinfall. It was Austin's first match in 19 years. == In wrestling == * Finishing moves ** As \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin *** Stone Cold Stunner (Stunner) ** As \"Stunning\" Steve Austin *** Stun Gun (Flapjack dropped into a hangman) ** As The Ringmaster *** Million Dollar Dream (Cobra clutch) * Signature moves ** As \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin *** Back body drop *** Knife-edged chop *** Leapfrog body guillotine *** Mudhole Stomp (Multiple stomps to the opponent's chest that is seated in the corner, he then follows it with the middle finger gesture to the opponent and followed with a final stomp) *** Pointed elbow drop, he sometimes performs it from the second or top rope *** Sleeper hold *** Spinebuster *** Stomp to the opponent's groin *** Texas cloverleaf *** Texas piledriver *** Thesz press or Spear, he then follows it with multiple punches ** As \"Stunning\" Steve Austin *** Hollywood and Vine (Standing figure four leglock) *** Knee drop *** Pointed elbow drop, sometimes from the second or top rope *** Schoolboy pin *** Sleeper hold *** That's a Wrap (Modified figure four leglock) *** Vertical suplex * Stables ** Dangerous Alliance ** Hollywood Blonds ** Million Dollar Corporation ** The Alliance ** The Power Trip * Managers ** Paul E.
