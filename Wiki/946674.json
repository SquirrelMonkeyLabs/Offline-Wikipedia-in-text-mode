 "text": "Since October 2021, there has been a political crisis in Iraq, with members of the Council of Representatives of Iraq being unable to form a stable coalition government, or elect a new President. Violent clashes in Baghdad after the 2021 parliamentary election and the attempted assassination of Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi began the crisis. On 18 November Muqtada al-Sadr said he would like to form a majority government. On 27 July, supporters of al-Sadr stormed the Green Zone and the Iraqi Parliament in Baghdad. ==References== Category:July 2022 events Category:2021 in Asia Category:2022 in Asia Category:2020s in Iraq Category:Politics of Iraq",
