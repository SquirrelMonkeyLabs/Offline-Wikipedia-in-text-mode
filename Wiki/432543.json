 "text": "Krip-Hop is a movement that draws attention to hip-hop artists with disabilities. Leroy Moore's Krip Hop Nation has released two mix tape CDs. The 'Krip' in Krip Hop is short for 'cripple'. The word is used by some disabled people to describe themselves. Moore chose to change the 'c' in 'crip' to a 'k' because there is a gang called the Crips. Krip Hop Nation performed at the Happening Weekend at DaDaFest 2010. ==Musicians== Krip-Hop musicians include Miss Money and Kalyn Heffernan. Heffernan has brittle bone disease. She is the frontwoman of a group called Wheelchair Sports Camp. ==References== Category:Hip hop Category:People with disabilities",
