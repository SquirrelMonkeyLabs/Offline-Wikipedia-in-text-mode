On April 5, 2011, Anoufriev and Lytkin were arrested in connection with a series of six murders and attacks on local residents in Akademgorodok of Irkutsk. The attacks, which involved a mallet and knife, began in December 2010. Anoufriev and Lytkin were arrested after a video recording showing the dead body of a woman being mutilated with a knife was found on a camera belonging to Lytkin's uncle, who had become suspicious. According to media reports, the youths had been influenced by reading about Alexander Pichushkin and the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs (Igor Suprunyuck and Viktor Sayenko) on the Internet. Anoufriev also took part in a Russian neo-Nazi march. A psychiatric examination found them to be sane, and they told doctors that they had chosen weak and drunk people as their victims. On 2 April 2013, Anoufriev was sentenced to life imprisonment and Lytkin to 24 years. == Murder victims == *December 1, 2010 - Danil Semyonov (age 12) *December 16, 2010 - Olga Pirog (age 69) *January 1, 2011 - unknown homeless man *February 21, 2011 - Alexander Maximov *March 11, 2011 - Roman Faizullin *April 3, 2011 - unknown homeless woman (born in 1948) == Sources == * Detainees in the case of serial murders in Irkutsk were neo-Nazis * Kids find and a dead body and………… * Interview with Anoufriev * Category:2010 crimes Category:Murder in 2011 Category:Russian criminals Category:Serial killers",
