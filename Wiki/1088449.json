Some of these practices are common and standard, such as clearing up facial acne, going to the gym, getting a new haircut, or moisturizing their skin. These practices are the most popular, and are known as \"softmaxxing\". Other practices have been associated with looksmaxxing, one popular practice is the act of \"mewing\", which involves moving your tongue to the roof of your mouth with the goal of getting a \"square jawline\". These methods are the most popular ones shared around TikTok, where men that look good are typically the ones giving the advice. These methods were used to be popular from magazines such as GQ, Esquire, and Men's Health sharing around skincare and hairstyle advice. Some people that practice \"looksmaxxing\" consider themselves to be making \"facial gains\". Some people who practice looksmaxxing have also practiced more extreme methods. This has been called \"hardmaxxing\", and those who practice hardmaxxing call themselves \"hardmaxxers\". Practices known to be hardmaxxing include getting implants or limb-lengthening surgeries, starving themselves on purpose (\"starvemaxxing\"), using moisturizers to attempt to appear more white (\"whitemaxxing\"), and trying to avoid sexual climax to try to boost testosterone (\"edging\").Rosdahl, Jamilla (31 January 2024). \"'Looksmaxxing' is the disturbing TikTok trend turning young men into incels\".
