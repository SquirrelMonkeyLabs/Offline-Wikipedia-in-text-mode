 "text": "Horseshoe Theory is an idea in political science. It asserts that the far- right is more similar to the far-left than to the center-right and vice versa. Horseshoe Theory is often used as an argument in favor of centrism. The name Horseshoe Theory comes from the idea that politics is not a straight line from left to right but bent like a horseshoe so that the two ends (the far-left and the far-right) share more similarities with each other than their moderate counterparts. Philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye invented Horseshoe Theory after observation of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union's joint invasion of Poland which started World War II. == Criticism == Common criticisms of Horseshoe Theory have often stated that politics are more complex than a simple scale between left and right, and many ideas the far-left follows are not followed by the far-right. Because of this, many experts, like Simon Choat, have said that Horseshoe Theory is false.Choat, Simon (May 12, 2017) \"‘Horseshoe theory’ is nonsense – the far right and far left have little in common\" The Conversation A common rebuttal to Horseshoe Theory is the broaching of Fishhook Theory. ==Related pages== *False equivalence *Fishhook Theory ==References== Category:Political science",
