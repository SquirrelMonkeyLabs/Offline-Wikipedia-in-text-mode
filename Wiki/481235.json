Their neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks was arrested for it. Families of the victims called it a hate crime. == History == Police do not know why Hicks might have done it. Police in Chapel Hill say Hicks had argued with the victims over parking spaces before. Neighbors said Hicks was obsessed over people parking in his space. His Facebook page says he supports “Atheists for Equality” and blamed “radical Christians and radical Muslims\" for causing problems in the world. The FBI was called in to help the local police. They also started an investigation to see if any federal laws have been broken. Federal officials did not find any evidence it was a hate crime. On 12 June 2019, Hicks pleaded guilty to the shooting.
