The original building, located in Kuala Lumpur, was named Wisma Putra in 1966 to honor Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al- Haj, Malaysia's first Prime Minister. This site was where the Chief Minister's residence used to be. On 1 February 2001, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced that Putrajaya would be Malaysia's third federal territory, and the Ministry moved there on 17 September 2001. The new complex also kept the name Wisma Putra. Category:Settlements in Malaysia",
