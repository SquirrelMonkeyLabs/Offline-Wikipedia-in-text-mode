 "text": "Visitas or \"asistencias\", were subsidiary missions of larger Catholic missions established during the 16th-19th centuries of the Spanish colonization of the Americas and the Philippines. They allowed the Catholic church and the Spanish crown to extend their reach into native populations at a modest cost. ==Description== Visitas served missions and were much smaller than the main missions with living quarters, workshops and crops in addition to a church. They were typically staffed with a small group of clergymen and a relatively small group of indigenous neophytes in order to maintain the facility. Particularly strategic visitas were later elevated to the status of a full mission. This typically included an expansion of existing facilities to support a larger clergy and indigenous neophyte population, improvement of basic infrastructure such as roads, and rechristening under a new Catholic saint. In Spanish Florida, visitas were mission stations without a resident missionary. Church buildings at visitas were simple, or sometimes absent. Visitas were often in satellite villages associated with a town with a doctrina (a mission with one or more resident missionaries). == Early history == The first Visita that was founded and documented seems to be one established in the village of Soloy (in modern-day Florida). Pedro Menéndez de Avilés designated it to become a blockhouse in 1567, but it became a visita to the Mission Nombre de Dios in the beginning of the 1600s. ==References== Category:Churches",
