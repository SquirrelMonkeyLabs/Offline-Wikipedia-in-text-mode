 "text": "High Force is one of Britain's great waterfalls. It is in Teesdale, County Durham. It was created by erosion when a river went through the rock and did not erode the hard upper layer of igneous rock, but eroded the bottom layer of soft limestone, a sedimentary rock. It is one of the biggest waterfalls in the UK. Category:Waterfalls Category:Bodies of water of the United Kingdom Category:Geography of County Durham",
