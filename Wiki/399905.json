 "text": "The second generation of video game consoles began in 1976. The second generation began with the release of the Fairchild Channel F and Radofin Electronics' 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System. This generation is sometimes called the \"early 8-bit era\". Many consoles were released in the second generation. The Atari 2600 was the most popular video game console for much of the second generation. Other consoles such as Intellivision, the Odyssey 2, and ColecoVision were also popular. The second generation ended in 1984. This was because of the video game crash of 1983. As of 2004, the Atari 2600 has sold 30 million units. As of 1990, the Intellivision had sold 3 million units. As of April 1984, the ColecoVision had sold 2 million units. As of 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units. ==Home systems== ===Comparison=== Name Fairchild Channel F Atari 2600 Magnavox Odyssey² Intellivision Atari 5200 Manufacturer Fairchild Semiconductor Atari Magnavox Mattel Atari Console Launch prices US$169.95 US$199 US$200 ¥49,800 US$299 US$270 Release date Media Cartridge Cartridge and Cassette (Cassette available via special 3rd party attachment) Cartridge Cartridge Cartridge Top-selling games N/A Pac-Man, 7 million (as of September 1, 2006) N/A Astrosmash (1 million) N/A Backward compatibility N/A N/A None Atari 2600 games through the System Changer module accessories (retail) N/A *Driving controller *Keypad *Game Brain *Starpath Supercharger *GameLine *The Voice *Chess Module *Keyboard component (cancelled) *Entertainment Computer System *Intellivoice *Trak-Ball Controller *Atari 2600 adaptor CPU Fairchild F8 1.79 MHz (PAL 2.00 MHz) MOS Technology 6507 1.19 MHz Intel 8048 8-bit microcontroller 1.79 MHz General Instrument CP1610 894.886 kHz Custom MOS 6502C 1.79 MHz (not a 65c02) Memory 64 bytes, 2 kB VRAM (2×128×64 bits) (within a MOS Technology RIOT chip): 128 bytes (additional RAM may be included in the game cartridges) CPU- internal RAM: 64 bytes Audio/video RAM: 128 bytes 1456 bytes main RAM 16 kB main RAM Video *102 × 58 pixels visible *8 colors, maximum of 4 per scanline *160 x 192 resolution *2 sprites, 2 missiles and 1 ball per scanline.

It was distributed and sold by Milton-Bradley in 1979. It was the first handheld game console that could use different game cartridges. The Microvision had a small LCD display. There were only a few games that could be played with this system. It was discontinued two years later. The Epoch Game Pocket Computer was released in Japan in 1984. The game system did not sell very well. Because of this, only five games were made for it. Nintendo's Game & Watch was more successful. It was very popular until it was discontinued in 1991. ===List of handheld systems=== File:Milton-Bradley-Microvision-Handheld-FL.jpg|Milton Bradley Microvision (Released in 1979) File:Game&watch-donkey-kong-2.jpg;|Nintendo Game & Watch (Released 1980-1991) File:Gamepocketcomputer.JPG|Epoch Game Pocket Computer (Released in 1984) ==Software== ===Popular games=== * Asteroids * Breakout * Defender * Donkey Kong * Frogger * Galaga * Galaxian * Mappy * Mario Bros. * Mr. Do! * Pac-Man * Pitfall! * Q*bert * Space Invaders * Spy Hunter * Tempest == References == == Other websites == *The Dot Eaters: Pixel Boxes Category:Video game consoles",
