 "text": "FAMM (Female Artists of the Mougins Museum) is a private museum located in Mougins in Provence (south of France), near Cannes, dedicated exclusively to female artists. It showcases a diverse collection of over a hundred artworks, including paintings, sculptures, and photographs from approximately 90 artists worldwide: Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, Leonora Carrington, Joan Mitchell, Lee Krasner, Alice Neel, Marina Abramović, Frida Kahlo, Tracey Emin, Jenny Saville, Sarah Lucas to mention but a few. The museum's collection spans several major artistic movements, from Impressionism to contemporary art. == Artists exhibited == The museum showcases Impressionists such as Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, and Eva Gonzalès; Blanche Hoschedé-Monet, who is closely associated with Impressionism through her stepfather, Claude Monet. Surrealism features prominently in the collection with works by Frida Kahlo, Leonor Fini, Leonora Carrington, and Dorothea Tanning. These artists are celebrated for their dreamlike, fantastical creations that explore the unconscious mind. FAMM also broadcasts American post-war Abstract Expressionists such as Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell and Elaine de Kooning that belonged to the famous and European abstractionists like Maria Helena Vieira da Silva. Their works are known for their expressive, non-representational forms that convey deep emotional and psychological states. In the realm of sculpture, museum-goers can also admire works by Louise Nevelson and Barbara Hepworth, both emblematic figures of modernism. Nevelson is renowned for her monumental, monochromatic wooden sculptures, while Hepworth's abstract sculptures have significantly contributed to modern art. Louise Bourgeois and Niki de Saint-Phalle are also noteworthy. Bourgeois, associated with Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism, is famous for her emotionally charged works that delve into themes of family and subconscious. Saint-Phalle, linked to the Nouveau Réalisme movement and feminist art, is known for her vibrant, large-scale sculptures that often address social and political issues. Conceptual and performance artist Marina Abramović is another key figure that will be exhibited at FAMM, renowned for her endurance- based performances that challenge the limits of the human body and spirit. In the realm of photography, artists such as Nan Goldin and Shirin Neshat contribute to the museum’s diverse collection with their powerful visual narratives inspired by their own lives and personal challenges. Major artists of our times are representing the contemporary art scene. Painters such as Catherine Goodman, known for her Expressionist style akin to Elaine de Kooning's, and her erotic subjects, coexist with Jenny Saville, whose work captures bodies at the peak of their resilience and fragility, where abstraction confronts figuration. Additionally, many other contemporary artists, such as Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas, alongside emerging artists, can also be admired by museum-goers. == Museum curation == The exhibition begins with the Impressionist movement, showcasing works by pioneers such as Berthe Morisot, Eva Gonzales, and Mary Cassatt. It then transitions to Post- Impressionism, with pieces like the oil on canvas Le fils du roi (1906) by Jacqueline Marval. The representation of daily life and landscapes evolves into the fantastical and whimsical forms characteristic of Surrealism. Notable works from this movement include Les étrangères (1968) by Leonor Fini and Mid- Day of the Canary (1967) by Leonora Carrington. The first floor is dedicated to abstraction, featuring key pieces from Abstract Expressionism, a major post-war artistic movement that emerged in the United States. Highlighted works include Prophecy (1956) by Lee Krasner, Abstraction #3 (1959) by Elaine de Kooning, and Joan Mitchell’s Rufus’ Rock (1966), inspired by her time on the French Riviera. The second floor focuses on figurative art and includes diverse and expressive styles. Important pieces on this floor include the sculpture Nature Study (2007) by Louise Bourgeois, the painting Jackie Curtis as a Boy (1972) by Alice Neel, and the photograph Carrying the Skeleton (2008) by Marina Abramović. The visit culminates with a contemporary exhibition featuring 21st-century artworks by modern female artists, who continue the legacies of their predecessors. Featured works include the sculpture Tit-Cat Down (2012) by Sarah Lucas, the oil on canvas Hurricane (2007) by Tracey Emin, previously part of the George Michael collection, and Jenny Saville RA's Generation (2012-2014), a work on paper. == Exclusive focus on female artists == The emphasis on female artists at FAMM stems from the evolution of Christian Levett’s collection, which began in the mid-1990s. Initially known for the Museum of Classical Art in Mougins, which he founded in 2011 and is noted for juxtaposing ancient artifacts with modern art, Levett’s interest shifted towards high-quality works by female artists, leading to significant acquisitions of their art. Historically, female artists have been underrepresented in museums and specialist publications, despite their substantial contributions to the art world. They frequently collaborated and competed with male artists, influencing one another. Helen Frankenthaler, an artist known for her pioneering work in abstract expressionism, famously said, “I am a painter, I am a woman... Gender contributes no more to the value of a piece than any other adjective you might place before the word painter—whether it's about color, religion, wealth, or culture.” FAMM aims to champion women artists, joining efforts with established institutions such as the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington DC, USA, and the Frauenmuseum in Bonn, Germany. The increase in temporary exhibitions dedicated to historically overlooked female artists has been notable in recent years, with major museums like Musée d'Orsay, Centre Pompidou, and Guggenheim Bilbao hosting such events. Additionally, numerous research projects, publications, conferences, and podcasts, such as Katy Hessel's The Great Women Artists, and organizations like AWARE, play crucial roles in promoting these studies and fostering a more inclusive and diverse artistic landscape. == Choosing Mougins as the location for FAMM == Mougins, a historic village situated between the sea and mountains, was chosen by Christian Levett as the site for his museum due to its rich artistic heritage and picturesque setting. The village has a long history of attracting notable artists and intellectuals such as Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, Coco Chanel, Paul Éluard, and Winston Churchill, making it a vibrant hub for art and culture. Additionally, Mougins' significant Graeco- Roman heritage enhances its appeal as a destination for art lovers and collectors. In 2023, recognizing the persistent underrepresentation of women in art institutions and historical narratives, Levett transformed his existing Museum of Classical Art in Mougins into FAMM (Female Artists of the Mougins Museum). This initiative aimed to create a dedicated space for celebrating and showcasing the contributions of female artists. == Christian Levett: collector, philanthropist, and owner of the museum == Christian Levett, a former British investment manager with a profound passion for art and history, is recognised as a dedicated and ethical art collector. He founded the Mougins Museum of Classical Art (Musée d'Art Classique de Mougins, MACM), and more recently transformed it into the Female Artists of the Mougins Museum (FAMM), reflecting his evolving focus on showcasing female artists. From an early age, Levett was captivated by the world of collecting, starting with 18th and 19th- century English coins and World War I campaign medals at just seven years old. After a successful career in finance beginning in his mid-twenties, he rekindled his love for collecting. This rediscovery coincided with his move to Paris, where he immersed himself in the city's rich museum culture, further fuelling his passion for art history. In June 2011, Levett opened the MACM in the medieval hilltop village of Mougins, South of France. The museum's innovative concept juxtaposes ancient and classically inspired art with modern and contemporary pieces, illustrating the enduring influence of antiquity on later artistic movements. The MACM quickly gained recognition, winning the Apollo Magazine new museum of the year award in 2011 and receiving a nomination for the European Museum of the Year in 2013. As his interests expanded into the broader art market, Levett began amassing a significant collection of 20th and 21st-century art, including post-war American art, Zero movement art, and African contemporary art. His collection of abstract works by female artists grew significantly, leading him to rebrand the MACM to FAMM, dedicating it to female artists and their contributions to the art world. Levett's philanthropy extends beyond the museum, having sponsored over 30 exhibitions at prestigious venues such as The British Museum, The Royal Academy, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others. He has also funded archaeological projects and academic scholarships, supported curatorial efforts, and contributed to significant renovation works in art and historical sites across Europe. Christian Levett remains actively involved in the art community as a member of the Arms and Armour Committee at The Metropolitan Museum of New York and sits on several influential boards and committees, continuing to influence the art world significantly. ==References== == Other websites == * Collecting stories: Christian Levett * Why Christian Levett is selling a museum-full of art * LES FEMMES ARTISTES PRENNENT ENFIN LA PLACE QUI LEUR REVIENT * Vu du Royaume-Uni.
