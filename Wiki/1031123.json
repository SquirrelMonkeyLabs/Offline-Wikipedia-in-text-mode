 "text": "The Huangpu River (Chinese: 黄浦江), 113-kilometer-long river that flows through the heart of Shanghai, China. Its headwaters come from Dianshan Lake on the Jiangsu border, and it flows through Qingpu District, Songjiang District, Fengxian District and Minhang District before turning abruptly northwards, continuing its course through Minhang District. The Huangpu curves as it becomes the border between Pudong New District and Xuhui District, flowing then past Huangpu District, the city center of Shanghai, after which it receives its main tributary, the Suzhou River. Afterwards the river serves as the border between Pudong New District and Hongkou District, then Yangpu District, and finally Baoshan District. The Huangpu River merges into the Yangtze River at Wusongkou, after which the combined waters flow gently into the East China Sea. Category:Rivers of China Category:Shanghai",
