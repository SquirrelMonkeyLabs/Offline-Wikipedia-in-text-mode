 "text": "An electric blanket is a blanket with electric heating. The first electric blanket was invented in 1912 by an American Medic named Dr. Sidney Irwin Russell. The public remained uninterested in the heated blanket until an English company started to produce and market heated blankets to the public in 1920. Some modern \"low voltage\" electric blankets have thin carbon fiber wires and work on 12-24 volts. Category:Home Category:Electronics Category:Home appliances Category:Heat",
