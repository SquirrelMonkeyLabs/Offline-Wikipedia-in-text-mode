 "text": "A pejorative (also called a derogatory term, a slur, a term of disparagement) is a word or grammatical form of expressing a negative term of someone or something, showing a lack of respect for someone or something. It is also used to express criticism, hostility, or disregard. Sometimes, a term is seen as pejorative in some social or ethnic groups but not in others, or may be originally pejorative and eventually be adopted in a non-pejorative sense. ==Related pages== *Insult *List of pejoratives ==References== Category:Criticisms",
