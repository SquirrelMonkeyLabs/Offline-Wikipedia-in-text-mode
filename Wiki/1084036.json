 "text": "Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States. He was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4th, 1961. He has been married to Michelle Obama since 1992. Some people believe Obama was not born in Hawaii, but instead in Kenya. This made them want to get him off the president title. Even though he had presented his birth certificate and information from the hospital, they still denied it. They tried to get president Obama impeached. Donald Trump started many rumours over the course of 5 years. However, Donald Trump never apologised. == References == Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Barack Obama",
