 "text": "Werner Scholl (1922-1944) was the brother of Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl. Like his siblings, Werner joined the Hitler Youth when Hitler came to power. In 1936, Werner, Sophie, and their sister Inge were arrested by the Gestapo. After being held for a few weeks, Werner was released, but the imprisonment left a mark on him. ==Life== In the Summer of 1939, Werner became the first member of the Scholl family to make an open resistance to the Nazi regime. He resigned from the Hitler Youth, a decision that barred him from being able to take the Abitur (similar to A-Level: the test to be able to enter a University). Werner also climbed on top of the statue of Justice at the Courtroom in Ulm to blindfold the Lady of Justice with a swastika flag. In 1942, Werner was sent out to the Russian front, where, by chance, he was stationed near Hans. The two were able to see each other fairly often. ==White Rose== In February 1943, Werner was given a leave to go home to Ulm. When he came home, he found out that Sophie and Hans had been captured by the Gestapo. Along with his parents, Werner travelled to Munich for the trial, storming into the courtroom just as Roland Freisler was about to give the verdict. After a brief stand-off, the Scholl parents were removed from the room. Because Werner had an army uniform on, he was able to melt into the crowd and be there when the judge announced the verdict: guilty. As those in the courtroom got up to leave, Werner was able to push his way up to see Hans and Sophie one last time. Werner grabbed their hands. Tears welled in his eyes as Hans said to him, “Stay strong. Make no concessions!” After his leave was up, Werner was stationed back at Russia. In the middle of 1944, Werner was classified as Missing in Action. He was 22. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:1944 deaths Category:German people",
