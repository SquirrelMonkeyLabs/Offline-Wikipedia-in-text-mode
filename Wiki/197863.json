Former Independent Democrats included Zadok Casey and Strom Thurmond. Harry F. Byrd, Jr., of Virginia would leave the Democratic Party in 1971, and would call himself an \"Independent Democrat\" from 1971 to 1983. A notable Independent Democrat is U.S. Senator and former Vice Presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who was kicked out of the Democratic Party when he formed \"Connecticut for Lieberman\" to get back in the Senate in 2006. Two incumbent Senators, Bernie Sanders and Angus King, were elected Independents in their respective states of Vermont and Maine but caucus with the Democrats.
