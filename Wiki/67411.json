In many species this does not always mean a sexual act; indeed, some sexual behavior among primates is mostly a social activity. == In humans == What is sexually attractive to humans may change by culture or place.

This involves the impact one's appearance has on the senses, especially in the beginning of a relationship: * Visual perception (how the other looks); * Olfaction (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repellent); * Audition (how the other's voice and/or movements sound). * Vibes, sensory perception (generally biased) of another person based on one's own view or from influence from others.
