In 2001, Luis Havas, an Argentinian soldier expatriated to Jalisco, announced plans to create a flag for the Mexican state of Jalisco. He proposed the old flag of Manuel Rodríguez, consisting of two blue stripes and a stripe of gold with the State Emblem in the center; it resembled the flag of the New Galicia or Intendence of Guadalajara from Priciliano Sánchez. A flag was adopted in February 2008, which was then replaced by the current one on May 7, 2011. The winning flag was the one designed by Luis Havas.
