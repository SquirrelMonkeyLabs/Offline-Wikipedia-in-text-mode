 "text": "The London Underground is a metro system in the United Kingdom. It serves Greater London and the nearby districts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. London Underground was first opened in 1863 which makes it the oldest underground metro system in the world. ==Stations== This list includes all stations on the London Underground and the Docklands Light Railway. Listed for each station is the line or lines serving it, the local authority and London Travelcard zone in which it is located,The London Underground uses a system of nine concentric zones for the calculation of fares between stations. Fares between any station in one zone and any station in another are the same, irrespective of the start and end points of the journey or the route used. the date it opened, previous names and passenger numbers in millions per year, where available. There are three instances where two separate stations share the same name: Edgware Road, Hammersmith and Canary Wharf. Although the Hammersmith & City line platforms at Paddington are on the other side of the mainline station from the platforms of the other Underground lines, it is treated as a single station. It is currently shown this way on the Tube map, but has been shown as two stations at times. Canary Wharf has separate Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway stations, which are shown as one station on current tube map. ==List== Station Line(s) Local authority Zone(s) Opened Mainline opened Other name(s)The other names listed may have been used previously on station signage, on network maps, in advertisements or in planning material – In the early years, slightly different names were sometimes employed contemporaneously for different purposes or on different parts of a station. A number of stations continue to bear obsolete early names where these form part of the physical architecture. For example, the platform wall tiles at Arsenal, Hampstead, Marylebone and Warren Street still carry the original names of these stations. Usage (millions)All usage statistics (total entry plus exits) are in millions per year for 2009 – . TfL does not publish usage data for the DLR.
