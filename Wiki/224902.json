 "text": "The Treaty of Paris was the treaty that formally ended the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain and the United States. The treaty was signed in Paris on September 3, 1783. The Continental Congress ratified the treaty for the Americans on January 14, 1784. British King George III ratified the treaty on April 9, 1784. Under the terms of the treaty, Britain recognized the new nation, agreed to remove all troops, and set new borders of the United States. The United States agreed to allow British troops to leave and to encourage the states pay all debts owed to Britain. It also agreed not to persecute the Tories (people loyal to the British king and so also known as Loyalists) who were still in the United States and to allow those who left America to return. France and Spain, which were allies of the United States, also signed peace treaties with Britain. France got Tobago, Senegal, and some other places. Spain wanted Gibraltar but instead got Menorca and Florida. The Netherlands, which signed later, did not gain or lose land but were forced to allow British trade in the Dutch East Indies. In India, the Kingdom of Mysore, which was supported by the French until the treaty was signed, continued fighting for another year but also neither gained nor lost any land. == Related articles == * Treaty of Paris (1763) == References == Paris 1783 Category:American Revolutionary War Category:1783 Category:1784 Category:1780s in the United States Category:1780s in France Category:18th century in Spain Category:History of the Netherlands Category:18th century in India Category:Treaties of the United States",
