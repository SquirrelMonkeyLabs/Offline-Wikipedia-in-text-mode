 "text": "Martinism is a form of Christian mysticism following with the fall of the first man, his state of material divine source, and the process of his return, called 'Reintegration' or illumination. As a mystical tradition, it was first transmitted through a masonic system created around 1740 in France by Martinez de Pasqually, and later propagated in different forms by his two students Louis Claude de Saint-Martin and Jean-Baptiste Willermoz. == References == ==Other websites== * Traditional Martinist Order (TMO), which operates under the aegis of AMORC—in English. * L'Ordre Martiniste Traditionnel (OMT), which operates under the aegis of AMORC—in French. *Synarchic Martinist Order (Filiation of Greece) *Ordem Martinista em Portugal Category:History of Christianity",
