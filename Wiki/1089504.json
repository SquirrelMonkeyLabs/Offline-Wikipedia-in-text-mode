 "text": "The blue-spotted bush frog or blue-spotted tree frog (Leptomantis cyanopunctatus) is a frog. It lives in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore. Scientists think it could also live in Brunei. People have seen it between 0 and 600 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that have been cut down and grown back. The forests grow in swamps, on flat ground, and up hills. Male frogs sit on plants 2.5 meters above the ground near streams and call for the females. Scientists believe that the female frog lays eggs in streams. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. The frog may be in some danger because human beings cut down the forests where it lives. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks. Sometimes people catch this frog for medical research. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
