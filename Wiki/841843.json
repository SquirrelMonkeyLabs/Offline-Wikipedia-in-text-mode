In the United States, the Special K Cereal has several different varieties: Red Berries, Blueberry Lemon, Original, Blueberry, Fruit and Yogurt and Vanilla Almond. In North America, Special K has meal replacements in two different forms: protein shakes or protein meal bars. In 2013 in the United Kingdom, many shoppers complained that Special K's flakes were too hard. The reason behind the extra crunch was the ingredient barley. Many other shoppers complained the cereal had become too sugary. The difference was some of the sugar was baked on the outside of the flakes. There are four flavors of Special K Protein Granola Bars. They are: Almond Honey Oat, Chocolatey Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate and Greek Yogurt and Fruit. There are five flavors of the Special K breakfast shakes.
