 "text": "\"Baby Got Back\" is a 1992 hip hop song by Sir Mix-A-Lot. The song is about larger than normal buttocks. At the time of its release, some found the lyrics objectionable. At the beginning of the song, two girls are talking. One says: \"Oh my God, Becky. Look at her butt!\" The video of the song was banned by MTV for a short time. The song was #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. In late January 2013, a preview of the show Glee included a cover of \"Baby Got Back\". Jonathan Coulton claimed Glee copied his version of the song. ==References== Category:1992 songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number one songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Obscenity controversies",
