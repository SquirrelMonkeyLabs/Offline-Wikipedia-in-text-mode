 "text": "Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) is a Social Security benefit in the United Kingdom. It is paid by employers to their employees when they are off work because of pregnancy. The mother must have been working for the same employer for six months continuously in the week 14 weeks before the baby is due. For the last eight weeks of that time they must have been getting at least enough to pay National Insurance Contributions. For the first six weeks they get 90% of their normal pay. Then for 33 weeks they get Â£156.66 a week or 90% of their normal pay if that is less. People may get Universal Credit at the same time. Maternity Allowance is usually paid to working women who do not get Statutory Maternity Pay. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom Category:Babies",
