The game was taken off Steam and other platforms on July 17, 2017. Like in the original games and most games in the series, the player can do skateboarding tricks and grinds to boost their score while skating around the levels. There are also objectives in the game such as getting a certain amount of score from tricks, collecting letters that spell out SKATE, and collecting secret DVDs. Both James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo of Metallica are playable characters that can be unlocked in the game. ==Reception== The game was given mixed reviews by game critics. Critics said that they liked the online mode and the soundtrack. However, they did not like that there wasn't modes such as the park creator and the ability to play multiplayer in splitscreen. ==References== Category:2012 video games Category:Tony Hawk video games Category:Activision video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Single-player video games Category:Skateboarding video games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in France Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games",
