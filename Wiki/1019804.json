 "text": "British Sugar plc is a subsidiary of Associated British Foods and is the main producer of sugar from sugar beet in the United Kingdom. It processes all sugar beet grown in the country and produces about two-thirds of the UK's sugar quota. The remaining sugar is produced by Tate & Lyle under license to American Sugar Refining, as well as through imports. British Sugar has a contract called the \"Inter Professional Agreement\" with growers, which determines the price paid for beet and the allocation of quotas. The National Farmers Union negotiates on behalf of the growers. The company was established in 1936 when the British government nationalized the sugar beet processing industry. It initially operated under the name British Sugar Corporation and later changed its name to British Sugar plc. In 1991, it was acquired by Associated British Foods. Over the years, several factory closures have occurred due to various reasons, including changes in sugar quotas and economic factors. Currently, four factories remain in operation: Bury St Edmunds, Cantley, Newark-on-Trent, and Wissington. == References == Category:1936 establishments Category:Food companies of the United Kingdom Category:Manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom",
