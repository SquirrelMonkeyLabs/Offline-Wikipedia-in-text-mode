One of the most famous monster sightings is the Loch Ness Monster. There are also sea monster sightings in apps, such as a mysterious creature in Google Maps found roaming the ocean. Some people think sea monsters exist. Other people say they aren’t real at all. There are also prehistoric creatures that may be called sea monsters. They are not real, so we refer them to as fictional creatures. Although they are not real, some creatures can look like sea monsters, such as anglerfish (Lophiiformes), giant squid (Architeuthis dux), colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), and the blobfish (Psychrolutes marcidus). == Sightings == === Loch Ness Monster === The Loch Ness Monster, better known as Nessie, is one of the most popular sea monsters.
