 "text": "Janenschia (named after Werner Janensch) was a huge, plant-eating dinosaur with an elongated neck and tail. It was a sauropod from the late Jurassic period, about 156 million to 150 million years ago. Janenschia had a small head, blunt teeth, and a short, thick tail; it was about 80 feet (24 m) long. This titanosaurid back may have been covered with bony, armored plates. Fossils have been found in Tanzania, Africa. It is said that this dinosaur was a secondary prey for T-rex. category:Dinosaurs of Africa category:Titanosaurs",
