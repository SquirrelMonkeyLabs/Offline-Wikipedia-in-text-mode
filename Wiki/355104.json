 "text": "Balgo is a small community in Western Australia. It is surrounded by the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert. It is an Aboriginal community; the area is traditionally Kukatja country. There are also some Pintupi families living there, who were displaced in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of them came to live here from Papunya, including some of the original artists of the Papunya Tula movement. Many of them later left Balgo when Kintore and Kiwirrkurra were set up in the 1980s. In 2006, Balgo had about 460 people living there. ==Other websites== * Warlayirti Artists and Cultural Centre * Luurnpa School Website * Balgo Adult Education Centre Website * Kutjungka Parish Website Category:Towns in Western Australia Category:Indigenous Australian communities",
