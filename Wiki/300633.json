 "text": "Dicraeosaurus had some physical differences from the rest of its family. The first fossil of Dicraeosaurus was discovered in 1914. It was named for the spines on the back of the neck. In general, sauropods had long necks and tails, skinny bodies and limbs, and tiny brains and heads. They were light in comparison with the brachiosaurs. Their vertebrae were a lattice of bony struts, used to reduce weight and take maximum stress. The family Dicraeosauridae had shorter tails, larger heads and longer neural spines along their neck and back. Dicraeosaurus lived about 155-150 mya during the time of its predators, Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus. Fossils of Dicraeosaurus have been found in the rocks of Tendaguru Hill in Tanzania. The rocks also yield fossils of an African Brachiosaurus and a Kentrosaurus. The difference in size between these animals suggests they would have browsed for vegetation at different levels. This allowed them to co-exist without significant competition. There is also speculation that female Dicraeosaurus were more dominant than males.
