 "text": "The Isuzu Rodeo was a mid-size SUV sold from 1991-2004. From 1991-1997, the 2.6-liter 4-cylinder 120 horsepower engine was standard on the 2WD Rodeo S. The Rodeo had an optional V6 engine and four-wheel drive. The first series Rodeos had a number of safety issues. It had very poor crash test scores. Front airbags were installed for the first time in 1995. The second generation Rodeo came out in 1998. A new V6 engine gave it much more power. While the exterior design did not change very much, it became known as one of the best SUVs available at the time. But it could not keep up with the other SUVs in the market. Isuzu would later replace the Rodeo with the Ascender, a badge- engineered GMC Envoy in 2005 == References == Category:Automobiles Category:Sport utility vehicles",
