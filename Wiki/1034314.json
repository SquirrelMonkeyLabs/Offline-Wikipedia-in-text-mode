It was started by Avraham Stern when the Irgun decided to stop fighting the British after Hitler attacked Poland so that they could fight the British while the British were fighting World War II. Yitzhak Shamir later took over the Lechi and ordered the assassination of some British politicians he said were anti-Semitic. David Ben-Gurion said the Lechi were terrorists. After Israel became a country, the Lechi joined the Haganah and Irgun in becoming the Israeli army. A lot of people who were in the Lechi also ended up becoming assassins for the Mossad who would hunt down and kill Nazis. Category:Zionists Category:Israeli military people",
