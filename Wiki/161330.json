 "text": "The pubis, or pubic bone, is one of the bones that make up the pelvis. It is ventral and anterior. In other words, it is at the front in humans, and below in most other mammals. The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis. In the female, the pubic bone in front is covered by the urethral sponge. This is a layer of fat, forming the mons pubis or mons Venus. The body of the pubis forms one-fifth of the acetabulum, the area around the hip socket. It contributes to the hip socket itself. Its inner surface is part of the wall of the lesser pelvis. == More images == Illu repdt male.jpg|Male reproductive system. Gray235.png|Right hip bone. Seen from outside. Gray236.png|Right hip bone.
