 "text": "From 1532 to 1762, Extraordinary Lords of Session were regular people who were members of the Court of Session in Scotland. They were part of the old legal system in Scotland. == History == When the Court of Session started in 1532, it had the Lord President, 14 Ordinary Lords, and three or four Extraordinary Lords. The Extraordinary Lords were chosen by the Monarch of Scotland and didn't have to be legally trained. They weren't paid and could choose when to attend court. This might have been a way to keep the barons happy, but it also made it easier for the king to influence court decisions. The Extraordinary Lords usually only showed up for cases that affected them personally. The number of Extraordinary Lords increased to eight in 1553 but was later reduced to four after protests. This number stayed around the same until 1723 when it was decided that any empty positions wouldn't be filled. Archbishop Burnet was the final clergyman to be an Extraordinary Lord, serving from 1664 to 1668. John Hay, the 4th Marquess of Tweeddale, was the last Extraordinary Lord, holding the position from 1721 to 1762. The practice of appointing Extraordinary Lords ended in 1721, and the role was officially ended by the Court of Session Act 1723. This act also stated that Ordinary Lords of Session must have legal qualifications.\"When the four present Extraordinary Lords of Session shall become vacant, no Presentation shall be made by the King to supply such Vacancy.\": Court of Session Act 1732 (Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom 10 Geo. 1 XIX.). 9 October 1722. == List of Extraordinary Lords == * 1539: William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven * 1539: John, Lord Erskine * 1541: William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal * 1541: William, Earl of Rothes * 1541: Robert Maxwell, 5th Lord Maxwell * 1541: John Lindsay, 5th Lord Lindsay * 1542: George Seton, 6th Lord Seton * 1542: Alexander, Lord Livingston * 1542: James Ogilvy, 4th Lord Ogilvy of Airlie * 1542: John, Lord Innermeath * 1554: Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington * 1554: Adam Livingstone of Dunipace * 1561: William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal * 1561: William Maitland of Lethington * 1561: James Balfour, parson of Flisk * 1562: John Wood of Tulliedairie * 1563: Adam, Bishop of Orkney * 1565: Alexander, Bishop of Galloway * 1566: Edward Henryson * 1566: John Wood of Tulliedairie * 1566: Gavin Hamilton, Commendator of Kilwinning * 1567: Sir John Wishard of Pitarrow * 1641: Archibald, Earl of Argyll * 1641: Archibald, Lord Angus * 1641: John, Lord Lindsay * 1641: John Lord Balmerino * 1649: John, Lord Coupar * 1649: John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis * 1661: John Lindsay, 17th Earl of Crawford * 1661: John, Earl of Rothes * 1661: John, Earl of Lauderdale * 1662: John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton * 1664: John Hay, 2nd Earl of Tweeddale * 1664: Alexander Burnet, Archbishop of Glasgow * 1667: Alexander Bruce, 2nd Earl of Kincardine * 1668: James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose * 1669: John, Earl of Dunfermline * 1673: John, Earl of Atholl * 1674: Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll * 1680: Alexander Stuart, 5th Earl of Moray * 1681: William, Earl of Queensberry * 1682: James, Earl of Perth * 1684: Charles Middleton, 2nd Earl of Middleton * 1686: William Douglas-Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton * 1686: Patrick, Earl of Strathmore * 1693: William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry * 1693: William Johnstone, 1st Marquess of Annandale * 1693: Patrick, Lord Polwarth, later Earl of Marchmont * 1693: William Douglas- Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton * 1694: Archibald, Earl of Argyll * 1696: James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry * 1699: Hugh Campbell, 3rd Earl of Loudoun * 1704: John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll * 1708: Archibald, Earl of Ilay * 1712: John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl * 1721: John Hay, 4th Marquess of Tweeddale == References == Category:Judges",
