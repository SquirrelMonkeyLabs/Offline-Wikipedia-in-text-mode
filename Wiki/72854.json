At first, the company only sold women's clothing. At that time, it was called Hennes, Swedish for \"hers.\" In 1968, Persson got the building and inventory of a Stockholm hunting equipment store named Mauritz Widforss. A supply of men's clothing was part of the inventory. This caused Persson to decide to also sell men's clothing. He renamed the store Hennes & Mauritz, later shortened to H&M.; H&M; has more than 1500 stores in 28 different countries. It has more than 60,000 employees. ==References== ==Other websites== * www.hm.com Category:1947 establishments in Sweden Category:Swedish clothing companies",
