In May 2011, an Italian court sentenced him four years in jail for market-rigging related to a 2005 takeover battle over Italian bank Banca Antonveneta. A Milan court has also ordered Fazio to pay a 1.5 million euro ($2.14 million) fine for his role in forcing Dutch Bank ABN AMRO to go against Italy's Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI). ==References== Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Governors of the Bank of Italy Category:Italian criminals",
