 "text": "The Pacific Telesis Group (or PacTel) were one of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies. These RBOCs were created in 1983 or 1984. The Pacific Telesis were made of the Pacific Bell, Nevada Bell and Pacific Telesis International. They were headquartered in San Francisco, California though incorporated in Nevada. The Pacific Telesis vanished rather fast when they were acquired by SBC Commumications (formerly the original Southwestern Bell) in April 1997. In turn, SBC would later become the new AT&T; Incorporated. ==The nickname== The Pacific Telesis were more commonly called \"PacBell\". Before the 1984 Bell System breakup, the actual corporate name for the principal subsidiary Pacific Bell was the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph (also known as the \"PacTel\"). The networks became AT&T; West beginning in 2005 or 2006 after SBC Communications, AT&T; and BellSouth combined to become the \"new\" AT&T.; ==References== Category:Companies of the United States Category:American telephone companies Category:1980s establishments in the United States Category:2000s disestablishments in the United States",
