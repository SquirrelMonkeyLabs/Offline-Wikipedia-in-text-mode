Aviation biofuel can be made from *plant or animal sources such as Jatropha, algae, tallows, waste oils, palm oil, Babassu, and Camelina *solid biomass. *The fuel can be made by an alcohol-to- jet (ATJ) process from waste fermentation *from synthetic biology Small piston engines can be changed, so that they use ethanol as fuel. Synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) is any non-petroleum-based fuel made (or designed) to replace kerosene jet fuel. Sustainable biofuels are an alternative to electrofuels (or e-fuels).
