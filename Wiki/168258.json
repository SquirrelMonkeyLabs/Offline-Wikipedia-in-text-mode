 "text": "Puget Sound is a sound in northwestern Washington State. It is a large area of salt water that is partially cut off from the rest of the Pacific Ocean. Many of Washington's cities, like Seattle and Tacoma are next to the sound. Many boats and ships travel on the sound. Some of the ships are ferries which take people and cars from the main part of Washington to the islands in the sound and to the Olympic Peninsula. Many ships come from across the ocean from places like Japan and China to trade in Washington. ==References== == Other websites == Category:Geography of Seattle Category:Bodies of water of the United States",
