 "text": "The Salyut program was a space program by the Soviet Union to create space stations. There were seven, single-module stations with the name Salyut that made it to orbit. An additional two stations failed during launch and were not given names starting with Salyut. Three of these space stations were part of the Almaz series of millitary space stations, instead of the civilian Salyut program. They used the name Salyut in order to try to hide their military use. Part of the design of the Salyut stations was later used as the basis for the core module of Mir. It was also used in the Zvezda servide module of the International Space Station. Part of the design of the Almaz stations was later used as the basis for the Kvant-1 module in Mir and the Zarya module of the International Space Station.
