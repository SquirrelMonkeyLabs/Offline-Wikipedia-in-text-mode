 "text": "Ynyshir is a village in Rhondda, Wales which neighbours Porth. Its name means \"Long Meadow\" or \"Long Island\". ==History== Before the 18th century only a few farms were found in Ynyshir. In 1845 the first deep coal mine was made in the village, it was the first coal mine to be opened in the Rhondda Fach valley. Ynyshir was part of the British coal empire. Ynyshir village began along the west side of the Rhondda Fach river on the land owned by Ynyshir farm, later followed by the building of houses east of the river on land owned by Maendy and Penrhiw farms. By 1900 much of the village which you can see today was in place. In 1841 the Taff Vale Railway reached the next village, Dinas and with the train this meant the owners of the coal mines could send their coal across South Wales. ==Important Buildings== Ynyshir was home to several chapels/churches, namely Ainon Chapel (Welsh Baptist), Bethany Chapel (English Baptist), Moriah Chapel (Calvinistic Methodist), St Anne's (Church in Wales), Saron Chapel (Welsh Independent), Ynyshir Welsh Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Bethel Chapel (Welsh Baptist), Penuel Chapel (English Independent), Tabernacle Chapel (Congregational Methodist) and Ynyshir English Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. ==Education== In 1882, the first boys school was made. Then, a girls and infants school was made in 1903. In 2009 the new modern Â£5.5 million Ynyshir Community Primary School located on Llanwonno Road was opened; this was to replace the previous Ynyshir Junior School and later in 2010 also replaced the old Ynyshir Infants School off Gynor Place. The first head teacher of the school was Miss Morgan and the present head teacher is Miss Phillips. ==Transport== Ynyshir has bus links. The nearest city is Cardiff. Ynyshir has no train stations.
