Born in Portsmouth, Fanny's mother has two sisters, one of whom has married Sir Thomas Bertram of Mansfield Park miles away and the other lives in a cottage on the grounds of Mansfield. This other sister, in an attempt to show off her own sense of self-importance and charity, offers to take one of her poor sister's children off her hands, and persuades Sir Thomas that Fanny could be her assistant in helping with the daily running of Mansfield and so should live there too. At Mansfield Park, Fanny grows up with her cousins Tom, Maria, Julia and Edmund Bertram. Only Edmund is kind to her. As they grow up, Edmund's kindness to Fanny makes her fall in love with him. However, when Fanny's uncle goes away for business, Mary Crawford and her brother Henry come to the neighborhood. Henry flirts with the Misses Bertram, making them fall in love with him, even though Maria is already engaged to a Mr. Rushworth. Mary and Edmund fall in love with each other, much to Fanny's surprise and sadness, but Mary wants Edmund to become rich and not be a clergyman. They put on a play called Lovers Vows that Fanny does not think Sir Thomas would like, so she does not join in. Just as they are trying to make her act, Sir Thomas returns home.
