 "text": "A community diagnostic centre is a place where people can go for medical tests in England. They were started in 2021 because of the the COVID-19 pandemic. It was important to keep people out of hospitals where they were more likely to get diseases. There were 40 centres at first. £350 million was there for the first year. £2.3 billion was set aside for up to 160 of the centres by March 2025. Most of them are on health care sites, with about 20% in shopping centres and similar places. By October 2022 92 centres had opened and they had done two million tests, checks, and scans. They are run by private companies. In August 2023 the government announced 13 new centres. They can deliver 742,000 more tests a year. 8 will be run by the private sector. People can get MRI scans, ultrasound, X-ray, breast screening, phlebotomy and bone density scans. == References == Category:National Health Service",
