It can be used in different ways, and it is possible to use love bombing either for positive or negative purposes. Psychologists say that love bombing may be part of a cycle of abuse. Love bombing has also been used in a group, to fight against a society, which is seen as hostile. In 2011, clinical psychologist Oliver James advocated love bombing in his book Love Bombing: Reset Your Child's Emotional Thermostat, as a means for parents to correct emotional problems in their children. == Use by new religious movements == The term love bombing was first used in the 1970s, by new religious movements. The Unification Church used it. Family International also used it. Psychology professor Margaret Singer reported on the concept. In her 1996 book, Cults in Our Midst, she writes: == Abusive relationships == Modern social media makes love bombing easy. The abuser can stay in contact with the victim nearly all the tiime. A sign of love bombing can be that at the start of a relationship, there is a lot of attention during a short period of time; there also is a form of pressure for a very very rapid commitment. Another sign of love bombing is being intensely showered with affection, gifts, and promises for the future with the predator. The victim feels or is made to believe that all this is a sign of \"love at first sight\". Since such signs of affection and affirmation may meet felt needs and not look harmful at the surface, the excitement of such a new relationship often does not appear as cause for alarm. However, after the initial excitement, when the victim shows interest or care about anything beyond their new partner, the manipulator may show anger, passive-aggressive behavior, or accuse the victims of selfishness. If the victim does not comply to demands, the devaluation stage begins: the abuser withdraws all affection or positive reinforcement and instead punishes the victim with whatever they feel is appropriateâ€”shouting, beratement, mind games, silent treatment, or even physical abuse. An article in Cosmopolitan explains: The expression has been used to describe the tactics used by pimps and gang members to control their victims. == Positive cases == Excessive attention and affection is not a form of love bombing if there is no intent or pattern of further abuse.
