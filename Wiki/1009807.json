The area was named after the Kvænangen fjord, which is the main geographic feature for the municipality. Over time, fisheries became a primary industry, and the community exported dried fish to southern areas.

The population is primarily of Sámi origin, although the Kven people also make up a part of the population.

In large part due to the generosity of the local population, prisoners had ample food. As the German Wehrmacht retreated in early 1945, the population was evacuated by force, and all buildings were burned. Today, a local museum shows typical reconstruction houses. Archeological finds indicate nomadic activity in the area going back 10,000 years. == Geography == The geography of Kvænangen is varied, with coastal and plains geography, extending into Finnmarksvidda. There are mature pine forests in the valley at the head of the fjord, and there are several rivers, the largest of which is Kvænangselva. The Øksfjordjøkelen glacier is located in the northern part of the municipality on the border with Loppa. ==Related pages== *List of mayors in Norway that are elected until 2027 == References == Category:Municipalities of Troms",
