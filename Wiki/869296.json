 "text": "Phyllomedusa bahiana is a frog that lives in Bahia and Brazil. Scientists have seen it up in the mountains, between 280 and 1000 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in forests near bodies of water that do not dry up. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. Some of the places it lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
