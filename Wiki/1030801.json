 "text": "Wing foiling or wing surfing or winging is a water sport similar to kitesurfing, windsurfing and surfing. The sailor, standing on a board, holds directly onto a wing. The wind acting on the wing moves the board across the water. Hydrofoil fins under the board allow the boards to lift out of the water and fly silently and smoothly above the water surface. == References == Category:Surfing Category:Wind energy",
