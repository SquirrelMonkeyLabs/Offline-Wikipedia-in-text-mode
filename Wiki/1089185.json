 "text": "The Critique of the Gotha Programme is an important document written in 1875 by the famous German philosopher, economist, and socialist revolutionary Karl Marx. In the document, Marx analyzed the proposed program of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), known as the Gotha Programme. == Background == The Gotha Programme was drafted during the unification congress of the SPD held in Gotha, Germany, in 1875. Its purpose was to establish the ideologies and politics that would guide the party's future actions and policies. However, Marx, along with his collaborator Friedrich Engels, criticized parts of the program. == Key themes == Critique on Lassalle: Marx's biggest criticism was that the Gotha Programme seemed to be based on the ideas of Ferdinand Lassalle. Lassalle was an important figure in the German workers' movement. Marx acknowledged Lassalle's contributions, but wrote that Lassalle focused too much on state intervention and the role of the state in transforming society. Marx argued for a more radical approach that would involve overthrowing the capitalist system. Labor Theory of Value: In his critique, Marx discussed the labor theory of value. He criticizes the Gotha Programme for not addressing labor compensation and the distribution of wealth. Marx argued that under socialism, individuals should be paid based on how much labor they did, not their needs. This contrasted with the principle of \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,\" as advocated by the Gotha Programme. Critique of the State: The Gotha Programme supported the idea of a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" Marx thought this would only perpetuate divisions among social classes. He thought a dictatorship of the proletariat would make it more difficult to achieve a society without social class. == Legacy == The Critique of the Gotha Programme has become a central text within Marxist theory and socialist thought. It has inspired numerous debates and interpretations among scholars and activists. It has also shaped discussions on the nature of socialism, the role of the state, and the organization of the economy. It is still relevant in today's discussions about socialism and communism. == References == * Marx, Karl. \"Critique of the Gotha Programme.\" *Marx/Engels Selected Works*, vol. 3.
