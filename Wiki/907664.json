 "text": "Arabisation (or Arabization) is a process where the influence of Arabic populations grows in an area. This will mean that the Arab ways of doing things will replace other ways over time. It will also mean that the Arabic lanuage will become more important. Usually, this will also mean that Islam will spread in the area. Non-Arabic populations will be assimilated over time (or leave the area altogether). Examples where Arabization happened are the south of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal, called Mozarabs), in the Middle Ages (undone by the Reconquista). In the Mahgreb, Arabization drove away many Berber people. Arabization also happened in the Near and Middle East. In Sudan and other parts of East Africa, Arabization also took place. In those areas, it was driven by trade. When Turkish troops and their allies conquered the city of Afrin in Syria, in 2018, they settled Arab people there. According to Kurdish sources, in June of 2018, almost 60 percent of the population of Afrin were Arabs. Before the Turkish troops took the city, the German newspaper, 'Die Welt' reported that ninety percent of the popuation of Afrin had been Kurds. == References == Category:Cultural assimilation",
