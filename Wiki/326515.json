 "text": "Daikin Park is a baseball park in Houston, Texas. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Houston Astros. It was originally called Enron Field. After Enron dropped its naming rights, the ballpark was temporarily renamed Astros Field. The park was renamed again when Minute Maid bought the naming rights. After the 2024 season, Minute Maid's parent, Coca- Cola, pulled out of its naming rights contract. Japanese conglomerate Daikin, which owns locally-based air conditioning manufacturer Goodman Global, bought the naming rights, and the stadium's name changed on January 1, 2025. Because the ballpark is small and cozy, it was sometimes called \"The Juice Box\" when Minute Maid held the naming rights. The stadium has a special roof which can be opened during nice weather and closed during rain. It also has a train above the outfield wall that moves on its track when the Astros get a home run. ==References== Category:Major League Baseball venues Category:Houston Astros Category:Buildings and structures in Houston Category:Sports buildings in Texas",
