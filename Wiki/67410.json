Most breakfast cereals are made for children, but there are many for adults as well. Some adult cereals are made for diets or other health benefits. == History == In the 19th century, Americans ate meat a lot for breakfast and usually did not eat grains and fiber. But after that, people who were interested in eating more healthy foods began a push for healthy breakfasts. This brought up the creation of Granula. The name Granula comes from granulates, formed of grain. In 1863 this became the first breakfast cereal and included heavy nuggets made from bran, the outer husk of a grain that is taken out when making flour. The cereal had to be soaked overnight before being eaten. Simply pouring milk over it was not enough to make it eatable. The cereals eaten today grew out of a health campaign that began in the 1860s. Thin baked dough served to patients in hospitals inspired two men, C.W. Post and W. K. Kellogg. These two men started their own companies, named them after themselves. ==Related pages== * Corn * Wheat * Grain == References == == Other websites == * Cereal site - All About Cereal * Cereals by the Vegetarian Society * Nutrition Facts on hundreds of cereals Category:Breakfast foods Category:Grains",
