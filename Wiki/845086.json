The adult male frog is 24.1 to 28.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult females frog is 31.8 to 35.4 mm. The frog is brown in color with white or yellow stripes on its head and back. This frog changes color: It is lighter at night. Scientists saw the frog in bodies of water in places that humans beings had changed, for example cacao farms and places where cows and other animals eat grass. Scientists named this frog nekronastes, which is Greek for \"thing that lives in the death-place,\" because it lives in cemetaries too. Scientists say this frog is in the same group as Dendropsophus leucophyllatus. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
