 "text": "Gregorio Rosa Chávez (born 3 September 1942) is a Salvadoran Latin Catholic prelate who was an Auxiliary Bishop of San Salvador from 1982 to 2022. He was a close collaborator of the slain Archbishop Saint Óscar Romero. Pope Francis made Rosa a cardinal on 28 June 2017 and he is the first cardinal from El Salvador. It is rare for the pope to name an auxiliary bishop as a cardinal as the bishop or archbishop of a diocese typically is afforded that distinction. In archdiocesan affairs the archbishop still has precedence, but Rosa ranks higher in the official structure. Besides his native Spanish, he can speak French and has some knowledge of both English and Portuguese. Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Salvadoran people",
