 "text": "DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) is a planned mission for a spacecraft and an atmospheric probe to the planet Venus. With the VERITAS, will also study Venus. It was selected by NASA on June 12, 2021 as a part of the Discovery Program. Its acronym is inspired by Leonardo da Vinci. DAVINCI will send an orbiter and a descent probe to Venus. the orbiter will take some images of Venus, while the atmospheric probe will study the Venus's atmosphere. The DAVINCI orbiter and descent probe will launch in 2034 or in 2035. DAVINCI scientists will explore how Venus's atmosphere evolved overtime. Goals: * Understand the begining of Venus's atmosphere and how it has changed * Investigate the possibility of an ocean in Venus's past. * Get high resolution imagese of the geological features of Venus. == Scientific payload == DAVINCI's descent probe will have DAVINCI'S Venus Analytic Laboratory instruments will have measurements during the probe's descent in the upper clouds of Venus. DAVINCI has four scientific instruments: the Venus Mass Spectrometer (VMS) will study the noble and trace gases at Venus, the Venus Tunable Laser Spectometer (VLTS), the Venus Atmospheric Structure Investigation (VASI) will provide measurements of the structure of the Venus's atmosphere, and the Venus Descent Imager (VenDI) will have high resolution images of Venus. The orbiter would also have scientific instruments. == Related pages == * Venera, a series of Soviet probes and landers Category:Venus Category:Proposed NASA space probes",
