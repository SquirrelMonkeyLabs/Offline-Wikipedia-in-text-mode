Two or more rappers compete to see who has the better verses. The raps can be rehearsed or freestyled. A freestyle battle is where the rappers use improvised lyrics. Battling can also occur on recorded songs. Each competitor's goal is to insult their opponent through clever lyrics. They must also convince the audience that they are the better rapper.
