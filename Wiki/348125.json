 "text": "The Astacus astacus (or noble crayfish, European crayfish, and broad-fingered crayfish) is a species of crayfish in Europe. Like other crayfish, the Astacus astacus lives in fresh water. It can live in streams, rivers, and lakes if it is not polluted. The Astacus astacus can be found living in France, Central Europe, Balkan peninsula, the British Isles, Scandinavia, and western parts of the former Soviet Union. Males can reach 16 cm long and females can reach 12 cm. The Astacus astacus is nocturnal, which means that it is only active at night. They eat worms, aquatic insects, mollusks, and plants. They spend the day resting in a burrow. They are sexually mature after three to four years. They breed in October and November of every year. The eggs will stay with the female until May. There are many predators that eat the Astacus astacus such as, minks, eels, perch, pike, otters, and muskrats. Because of the crayfish plaque that was brought from the American species the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), it is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. ==References== Category:Decapods",
