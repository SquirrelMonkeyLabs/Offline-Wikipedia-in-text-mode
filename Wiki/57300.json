 "text": "Archie Moore (born Archibald Lee Wright; December 13, 1913 – December 9, 1998) was an American boxer. He held the light heavyweight championship between 1952 and 1962. Moore won the title from Joey Maxim by unanimous decision in November 1952. He later lost the belt because he did not defend the title enough times. Moore also fought for the heavyweight championship twice. He lost to Rocky Marciano on September 22, 1955, and to Floyd Patterson on November 30, 1956, in both of those attempts. One of his last fights was with Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali. Afterwards, Moore trained Ali for a few short months. ==Filmography== Year Title Role Notes 1960 The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Jim 1964 The Carpetbaggers Jedediah 1964 The Hanged Man Xavier TV movie 1966 The Fortune Cookie Mr. Jackson 1970 My Sweet Charlie TV movie 1973 The Outfit Packard 1975 Breakheart Pass Carlos 1993 The Adventures of Huck Finn cameo role ==Professional boxing record== Result Record Opponent Type Round Date Age Location Notes 220 Win 186–23–10 Mike DiBiase TKO 3 (10) Mar 15, 1963 219 Loss 185–23–10 Cassius Clay TKO 4 (12) Nov 15, 1962 218 Draw 185–22–10 Willie Pastrano MD 10 May 28, 1962 217 Win 185–22–9 Howard King KO 1 (10) May 7, 1962 216 Win 184–22–9 Alejandro Lavorante TKO 10 (10) Mar 30, 1962 215 Win 183–22–9 Pete Rademacher TKO 6 (10) Oct 23, 1961 214 Win 182–22–9 Giulio Rinaldi UD 15 Jun 10, 1961 213 Win 181–22–9 Buddy Turman UD 10 Mar 25, 1961 212 Win 180–22–9 Buddy Turman UD 10 Nov 28, 1960 211 Loss 179–22–9 Giulio Rinaldi PTS 10 Oct 29, 1960 210 Win 179–21–9 George Abinet RTD 3 (10) Sep 13, 1960 209 Win 178–21–9 Willi Besmanoff TKO 10 (15) May 25, 1960 208 Win 177–21–9 Yvon Durelle KO 3 (15) Aug 12, 1959 207 Win 176–21–9 Sterling Davis TKO 3 (10) Mar 9, 1959 206 Win 175–21–9 Yvon Durelle KO 11 (15) Dec 10, 1958 205 Draw 174–21–9 Howard King PTS 10 Aug 4, 1958 204 Win 174–21–8 Howard King UD 10 Jun 9, 1958 203 Win 173–21–8 Charley Norkus UD 10 May 26, 1958 202 Win 172–21–8 Howard King UD 10 May 17, 1958 201 Win 171–21–8 Willi Besmanoff SD 10 May 2, 1958 200 Win 170–21–8 Bob Albright TKO 7 (10) Mar 10, 1958 199 Win 169–21–8 Bert Whitehurst TKO 10 (10) Mar 4, 1958 198 Win 168–21–8 Julio Neves KO 3 (10) Feb 1, 1958 197 Win 167–21–8 Luis Ignacio PTS 10 Jan 18, 1958 196 Win 166–21–8 Roger Rischer KO 4 (10) Nov 29, 1957 195 Win 165–21–8 Eddie Cotton UD 10 Nov 5, 1957 194 Win 164–21–8 Ralph Hooker TKO 5 (10) Oct 31, 1957 193 Win 163–21–8 Tony Anthony KO 7 (15) Sep 20, 1957 192 Win 162–21–8 Alain Cherville TKO 6 (10) Jun 2, 1957 191 Win 161–21–8 Hans Kalbfell UD 10 May 1, 1957 190 Loss 160–21–8 Floyd Patterson KO 5 (15) Nov 30, 1956 189 Win 160–20–8 Roy Shire TKO 3 (10) Sep 8, 1956 188 Win 159–20–8 James J.
