It is held each autumn in the English seaside resort of Blackpool on the Fylde Coast in Lancashire. Also known locally as The Lights or The Illuminations, they run each year for sixty six days. It starts from late August until early November at a time when most other English seaside resorts' seasons are coming to an end. Dubbed as The greatest free light show on earth, they are 6 miles (10 km) long and use over one million bulbs.Go To Blackpool \"Blackpool Illuminations\" , Go To Blackpool, accessed November 01, 2010. ==References== Category:1879 establishments in England Category:Blackpool Category:Festivals in the United Kingdom",
