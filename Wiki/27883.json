 "text": "Adult Swim (stylized as [adult swim] since 2003 and is also shortened to [as]) is an American adult-oriented nighttime programming block on the basic cable network Cartoon Network that is programmed by its in-house production studio, Williams Street. Marketed as a separate network for ratings purposes, Adult Swim broadcasts from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. (Mondays-Saturdays) and from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. (Sundays) ET/PT. Debuting on March 2, 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and it was established as alternative programming during late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience would normally be sleeping. By 2005, Adult Swim would be granted its own separate Nielsen ratings report from Cartoon Network due to it targeting a different audience. The block features stylistically varied animated and live- action shows, including original programming, syndicated series, anime, original video animations, and short films with generally minimal or no editing for content. Adult Swim has frequently aired adult animation features, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, and pilots. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and surrealist in nature. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurd and shock comedy. ==References== Category:2001 establishments in California Category:Adult Swim Category:American television networks Category:American television series Category:American television stations Category:NBCUniversal",
