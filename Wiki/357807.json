 "text": "The Waltons (September 14, 1972-June 4, 1981) was an American television series. It was about a family in rural Virginia between 1933 and 1946, during the Great Depression and the Second World War. The series was distributed by Lorimar and syndicated via Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. Six television movies followed this: three in 1982, and another three in the 1990s. The series lasted almost nine years. Although the story takes place in Virginia, the entire series was filmed in Los Angeles in the Warner Bros. Studios. The house (outside and inside) was build in the studio, just for the series. The mountain in the background (which has the Hollywood Sign that was hidden, and which was shown as heavily forested and green with special effects) stood in for the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. == Other websites == * Category:1970s American television series Category:1972 American television series debuts Category:1981 American television series endings Category:Fictional families Category:English-language television programs",
