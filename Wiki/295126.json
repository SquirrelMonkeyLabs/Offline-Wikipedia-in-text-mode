He played with the Montreal Canadiens, Tampa Bay Lightning, Toronto Maple Leafs and Colorado Avalanche. He was drafted 151st overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1993 NHL Entry draft. He became known in Long Island during the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs after Tucker delivered a hip check to New York Islanders' captain Michael Peca during game five of the first round. The hit blew out Peca's MCL and ACL on his left knee which ended his season and delayed his entry into the 2002â€“03 season. There was no penalty given out. Tucker retired from playing professional ice hockey on October 1, 2010. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian ice hockey left wingers Category:Colorado Avalanche players Category:Fredericton Canadiens players Category:Ice hockey people from Alberta Category:Kamloops Blazers players Category:Memorial Cup winners Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:Tampa Bay Lightning players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players",
