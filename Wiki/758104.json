 "text": "King's Field is an action RPG made by FromSoftware. The game's design would influence how FromSoftware would make their later games, especially the Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. Like From's later games, it is a high difficulty RPG where the player would have a slow attack speed. Due to this. the player will need to master the spacing and time of their attacks. However, what makes King's Field different from the later From games is that the game is played from a first-person point-of-view, whereas the later games would be from a third-person point-of-view. Confusingly, the game called King's Field that came out in the United States was actually called King's Field II in Japan.
