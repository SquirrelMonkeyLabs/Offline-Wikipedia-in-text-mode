 "text": "Walk of Life is the second album by pop singer Billie Piper, released in 2000. Piper's second album did not match the successful start in terms of album sales despite producing three Top 30 singles - \"Day and Night\" went to #1 and \"Something Deep Inside\" managed to get to #4 and \"Walk of Life\" finishing at #25 on the UK charts. Despite good reviews, the album was not released in the US. Piper then decided have a break from the music industry and concentrate on acting. ==Track listing== # \"Day & Night\" # \"Something Deep Inside\" # \"Walk of Life\" # \"Safe with Me\" # \"Bring It On\" # \"Ring My Bell\" # \"The Tide Is High\" # \"Run That By Me\" # \"Promises\" # \"Because of You\" # \"What Game Is This?\" # \"Misfocusing\" # \"Makin' My Way (Anyway That I Can) - Pokemon Official Soundtrack\" ==References== Category:2000 albums Category:Billie Piper albums Category:Pop albums",
