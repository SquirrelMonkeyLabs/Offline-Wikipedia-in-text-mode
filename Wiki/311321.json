The high number of Cuban refugees Florida receives is due to its proximity to Cuba. It is called Little Havana because Cuba's capital is Havana. There is also a smaller Little Havana in Tampa, Florida. In recent years, increasing numbers of Honduran, Nicaraguan, and Guatemalan immigrants have moved into the neighborhood. At the same time, increasing numbers of Cubans left the area for the suburbs in western Miami. Part of Little Havana is now called Little Managua named after the Nicaraguan capital. == Calle Ocho Festival == The Calle Ocho Festival is held in Little Havana. Category:Miami",
