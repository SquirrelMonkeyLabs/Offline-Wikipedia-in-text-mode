Once you pluck a string or strum a chord, the vibration of the strings is amplified by the highest of the guitar and thru the soundhole. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum (\"pick\"), to make them sound.
