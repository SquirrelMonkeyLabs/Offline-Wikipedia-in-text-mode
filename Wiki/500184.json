The book caused both praise and controversy. Some of Boris Pasternak's story had been available in Samizdat for some time after World War II. But the novel did not get written until 1956. The book had to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union, because their government banned it for its views against Communism. It was taken by a trusted friend to an Italian publisher who printed and released it. Many people heard about the book because of the Soviet Union actions taken against the novel. It became very popular in the non-communist world. It spent 26 weeks at the top of the New York Times best-seller list. A great poet who wrote about how he felt, Pasternak was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature. Even though the award was given for his poetry, it was known that the prize was mainly for Doctor Zhivago. The Soviet Union saw this Nobel Prize as a personal attack against their government itself. Pasternak was said to be a traitor by their leaders, so he refused to accept the Prize. The public now thought Pasternak was a Cold War symbol of rebellion against Soviet communism. The movie plot was the same as the novel in some ways, but some changes were made. Many critics said that the movie gave too much attention to the love story between Zhivago and Lara. This downplayed the events of the Russian Revolution and the civil war that it caused. ==References== Category:1965 romantic drama movies Category:1960s historical movies Category:1960s epic movies Category:Italian romance movies Category:Italian drama movies Category:American romantic drama movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies about revolutions Category:Movies set in Russia Category:Movies set in Saint Petersburg Category:Movies set in the 1890s Category:Movies set in the 1900s Category:Movies set in the 1910s Category:Movies set in the 1920s Category:Movies set in the 1930s Category:Movies set in the 1940s Category:Academy Award winning movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies composed by Maurice Jarre",
