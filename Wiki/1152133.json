 "text": "The Christianization of the Croats refers to the process through which the Croats adopted Christianity. This transformation occurred during the early Middle Ages, primarily in the 7th to 9th centuries. The process was influenced by interactions with Byzantium, Rome, and neighboring Christianized tribes. == Historical context == # Arrival of the Croats: The Croats migrated to the territory of present-day Croatia in the early 7th century, following the decline of the Roman Empire. Initially pagan, they practiced polytheistic beliefs centered around Slavic gods and natural elements. # Missionaries and Christian influences: Christian missionaries from both the Eastern Byzantine Empire and the Western Roman Catholic Church played a significant role in spreading Christianity. The Croatsâ€™ proximity to Dalmatian coastal cities, which were already Christianized, also contributed to the process. == Key developments == # Baptism of leaders: Early Croatian rulers embraced Christianity as a political and cultural strategy to align with powerful Christian empires. According to tradition, the baptism of Croatian leaders took place in the 9th century under the guidance of missionaries sent by Rome. # Establishment of the Church: By the 9th century, Christian dioceses were established in Dalmatian cities like Split, Zadar, and Dubrovnik. These cities became centers for spreading Christian teachings further inland. # Cultural transformation: The adoption of Christianity brought significant changes to Croatian society, including the construction of churches, monasteries, and the integration of Christian holidays and moral values into daily life. == Legacy == The Christianization of the Croats solidified their ties with Western Europe and the Roman Catholic Church. This alignment influenced Croatia's political, cultural, and religious identity for centuries. Today, Christianity remains a cornerstone of Croatian national identity.
