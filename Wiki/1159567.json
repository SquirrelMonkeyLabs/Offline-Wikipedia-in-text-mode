Vyommitra plans to visit space multiple times. Some journeys she will travel alone and others she will be in a team. She will run tests and help to track important data such as air quality and temperature on the Indian spacecraft Gaganyaan. Vyommitra will also help to inspire and educate the public about space, robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Vyommitra is called a \"half-humanoid\" robot because she has a head, shoulders, arms and torso â€“ but no legs. == References == Category:2020 in India",
