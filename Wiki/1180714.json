 "text": "Arkalon is a ghost town located in Seward County, Kansas. It is located northeast of Liberal on the west side of the Cimarron River. == History == After the Chicago, Kansas, and Nebraska Railway was built through the area in 1888, a town sprang up and platted. The town was named Arkalon for Arkalon Tenny, the father of the first postmaster of the town, Hosea Eugene Tenny. A post office named Arkalon opened in 1888 and continued operating until 1929. The Arkalon News newspaper was published from April 1888 until December of 1892. In 1891, a one-room schoolhouse was opened for children. A large stockyard was build to ship cattle to market. While the nearby river was promising for the early settlers, the land next to it was sandy and flooded often. By the 1920s most of the early settlers had left, leaving only railroads and the stockyard behind. Category:United States Category:Ghost towns in Kansas",
