It is available in many electronic devices, particularly those of greater value but of little weight or size. It is made by a small, metal-reinforced hole, in which a padlock tied by means of a cable can be attached to a fixed object to prevent the device from being pulled. == Descriptive images == File:Kensington-lock- slot.jpg|link=Fitxer:Kensington-lock-slot.jpg|alt=Forat per al connector|Plug slot File:Kensington-lock-connected.jpg|link=Fitxer:Kensington-lock- connected.jpg|alt=Connexi√≥|Connection File:Kensington- lock.jpg|link=Fitxer:Kensington-lock.jpg|alt=El connector en si|The plug itself == References == Category:Security technology",
