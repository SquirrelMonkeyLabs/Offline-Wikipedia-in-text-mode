 "text": "The Bergen Line or the Bergen Railway is a standard-gauge railway line between Bergen and HÃ¸nefoss, in Norway. It is the highest mainline railway line in Northern Europe. This route is very picturesque because of the many mountains. The railway opened from Bergen to Voss in 1883. In 1909 the route was continued over the mountain to Oslo and the whole route converted to standard gauge. ==References== Category:Rail transport in Norway Category:Bergen Category:Buskerud",
