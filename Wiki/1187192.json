 "text": "The Olive spiny-chest frog (Alsodes verrucosus) is a frog. It lives in Chile. Scientists think it may also live in Argentina. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog under logs and in other places with water in Nothofagus forest. Scientists have seen the frog between 500 and 1000 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in one protected place: Puyehue National Park. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in deep, cold streams. They are most active at night. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frogs live to get wood to build with and make dams for electricity. In Argentina trout fish from from other parts of the world might eat this frog or its young. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
