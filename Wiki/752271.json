 "text": "The flag of Serbia and Montenegro was originally adopted on 27 April 1992 as the flag of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and was used as such from 1992 to 2003. After the country was renamed to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003, it was still used as the national flag until the country's dissolution in June 2006. Aside from a different aspect ratio, it is almost the same flag that used by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1943â€“1992) but without the red star in the center. It was like an inverted Dutch flag. == Related pages == * Coat of Arms of Serbia and Montenegro * Flag of Yugoslavia * Flag of Montenegro * Flag of Serbia == References == Serbia and Montenegro Category:National symbols of Montenegro Category:National symbols of Serbia",
