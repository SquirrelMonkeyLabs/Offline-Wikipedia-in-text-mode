 "text": "At midnight EST on Saturday, December 22, 2018, the Federal government of the United States began a shutdown because neither legislative funding was passed for the upcoming fiscal year or a continuing resolution. It lasted until 25 January 2019, the longest shutdown in history. This was also a response from President Donald Trump’s refusal to sign a bill to keep the government open due to lack of funding for his border wall. The shutdown could cost billions of dollars. ==References== Category:2018 in the United States Category:2019 in the United States Category:December 2018 events Category:Donald Trump Category:January 2019 events",
