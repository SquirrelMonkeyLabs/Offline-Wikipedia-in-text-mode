 "text": "Ferguson v. McKiernan is a 3-2 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling from 2007 which reversed a lower court's ruling. The lower court ruled that sperm donor Joel McKiernan had to pay child support. In its ruling, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that sperm donors would be less likely to donate their sperm if they were at risk of being forced to pay child support. The two dissenting Justices said that there was no basis in existing Pennsylvania law for the court's ruling. ==References== Category:2000s in Pennsylvania",
