It was the home ground of SK Rapid Wien from 1912 till 1978.Geschichtewiki Wien (German) ==History== After the loan for the Sportplatz Rudolfsheim was quited SK Rapid went to Hütteldorf where they built a new home.Rapid Archiv (German) The place was owned by the St Peter's Abbey in Salzburg and managed by the parish of Hütteldorf. This is the reason why the ground was called \"Pfarrwiese\". The loan was 800 Kronen/Year (which is approximately 4.300 €). Also two tickets for each match were part of the contract. The ground was built between August 1911 and April 1912. Architect was Eduard Schönecker, who also planed the Hohe Warte Stadium. The capacity was 4 000 and was step by step expanded to 8000. The pitch was borderd with a cinder track. The place was opened on 28 April 1912 with two matches in front of 3000 visitors. Rapid played versus WAC and won 2-1. The main match was Amateure versus Cricketer. The club decided to built a stadium because Rapid became very sucessful and the old place was therefore to small. In June 1919 15 000 people where at the Pfarrwiese to see the match versus MTK Budapest. The new stadium was also planed by Eduard Schönecker. It had a capacity of 24. 150. If a lot of people were expected Rapid went often to the Praterstadion. The demages in the Second World War were small so the first match on the Pfarrwiese was held on 1 May 1945. A combined team of SK Rapid and Vienna played versus a team of the Red Army. The last modifications were made in 1955. In 1977 the Weststadion was built and Rapid left the Pfarrwiese.
