Diego Semerone gave the movie 0.5 stars out of 4. He said: \"The film is an unquestionably pornographic fantasy barely trying to pass as something other than masturbation material. Below Her Mouth's stiff acting and dialogue suggest a Blue is the Warmest Color influence reduced to sexy aesthetics of lesbian sex.\" Katie Walsh from the Los Angeles Times said: \"Despite female filmmakers at the helm, the film treads into the exploitative territory, with the ratio of screen time given to writhing female bodies far outweighs that given to their unique experience as gay or closeted women in the world.\" ==References== Category:2016 romantic drama movies Category:2016 LGBT movies Category:Canadian drama movies Category:Canadian LGBT movies Category:Canadian romance movies",
