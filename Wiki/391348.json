 "text": "Corrective rape (sometimes called curative rape) is a hate crime where a person is raped, because of their perceived sexual orientation. People claim to be able to \"cure\" homosexuals by raping them. Additionally, studies relying on convenience samples can result in higher rates of abuse, which have limited validity describing rates of abuse in the wider population. The people raping say that they can \"correct\" their orientation, to turn them heterosexual, or to make them \"act\" more in conformity with gender stereotypes. The term was coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rapes of lesbians like Eudy Simelane and Zoliswa Nkonyana became public. There are many health problems associated with corrective rape, and although some countries have laws protecting LGBT people, corrective rape is often overlooked.
