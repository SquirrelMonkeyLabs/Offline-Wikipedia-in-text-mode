 "text": "Bernard Charles \"Barry\" Sherman, (February 25, 1942 – December 13, 2017) was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist. He was born in Toronto. He was the chairman and CEO of Apotex Inc. With an estimated net worth of US$3.2 billion at the time of his death, according to Forbes, Sherman was the 12th-wealthiest Canadian. Another publication, Canadian Business, said his fortune at $4.77 billion (CAD), ranking him the 15th richest in Canada. On December 15, 2017, police officers entered Sherman's home in North York, Toronto, where they discovered the bodies of Sherman and his wife Honey hanging side by side next to their indoor pool. Sherman was 75 years old. Post-mortem examinations showed the cause of death for both deceased was \"ligature neck compression\". In response, the couple's four children said their deaths may be murder–suicide theory. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Toronto Category:Canadian billionaires Category:Canadian murder victims Category:Deaths by strangulation Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Unsolved murders",
