 "text": "Stryper is a Christian metal band from Orange County, California. The group's lineup consists of Michael Sweet (lead vocals, guitar), Oz Fox (guitar), Tim Gaines (bass guitar), and Robert Sweet (drums). In 2004 Gaines left the band and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar) but rejoined in 2009. Formed in 1983 as Roxx Regime, they would change their message and name to Stryper to go on to be the first Christian rock band to be recognized by the mainstream. In 1983 they were signed by Enigma Records and released their first album The Yellow and Black Attack. By the mid-1980s, Stryper saw their most successful period starting with the release of To Hell with the Devil which achieved Platinum sales status. Stryper would go on to release two more Gold albums before breaking up in 1992. In 2003 Stryper came out of retirement for a reunion tour and subsequently signed a multi-album contract with Big3 Records in 2005. The name \"Stryper\" derives from the King James Version of the Bible. \"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\" The reference, Isaiah 53:5, is frequently included as part of their logo. Stryper's drummer, Robert Sweet, also created a backronym for their name: \"salvation through redemption, yielding peace, encouragement and righteousness\". ==Discography== *The Yellow and Black Attack (1984) *Soldiers Under Command (1985) *The Yellow and Black Attack (Re-Issue) (1986) *To Hell with the Devil (1986) *In God We Trust (1988) *Against the Law (1990) *Reborn (2005) *Murder by Pride (2009) *The Covering (2011) ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Homepage *Michael Sweet's site *Stryper at Metal Archives *Stryper Expo 2000 *Stryper Expo 2001 *Kingdom Extreme Magazine interview with guitarist Oz Fox 2009 Category:1980s music groups Category:1990s music groups Category:2000s music groups Category:2010s music groups Category:American heavy metal bands Category:Glam metal bands Category:Christian metal bands Category:American hard rock bands Category:American rock bands Category:Christian rock bands Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Enigma Records artists",
