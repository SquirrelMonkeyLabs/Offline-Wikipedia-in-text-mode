There is a predecessor to this game named Donkey Kong Land and a sequel called Donkey Kong Land III. ==Story== The plot is similar to Donkey Kong Country 2's plot. It has King K. Rool once again kidnapping Donkey Kong, who can only be freed if Diddy Kong gives the bananas from the Banana Hoard to K. Rool. ==Worlds== This game has seven total worlds in the game, as opposed to eight in Donkey Kong Country 2. The second and third worlds (Crocodile Cauldron and Krem Quay) of Donkey Kong Country 2 have been merged into Krem Cauldron, possibly to save memory on the game's cartridge. Like Donkey Kong Country 2, there is a Lost World which can be unlocked if Diddy and Dixie pay Klubba fifteen Kremkoins to a level per world. The worlds include: #Gangplank Galleon #Krem Cauldron #Krazy Kremland #Gloomy Gulch #K. Rool's Keep #The Flying Krock #Lost World Category:1996 video games Category:Donkey Kong Category:Rare (company) games Category:Game Boy games Category:Platform games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about pirates Category:Virtual Console games",
