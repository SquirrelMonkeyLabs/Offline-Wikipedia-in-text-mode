 "text": "Dutch Americans (Dutch: Nederlandse Amerikanen), not to be confused with the Pennsylvania Dutch, are Americans of Dutch descent whose ancestors came from the Netherlands. Dutch settlement in the Americas started in 1613 with New Amsterdam, which was exchanged with the English for Suriname at the Treaty of Breda (1667) and renamed to New York City. The English split the Dutch colony of New Netherland into two pieces, and named them New York and New Jersey. More immigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries. ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in the United States",
