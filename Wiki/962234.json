 "text": "Hyloscirtus is a genus of frogs. They are Neotropical frogs. They are in the family Hylidae. Scientists stopped using this genus fora time, but they started again in 2005 after they looked at the Hylidae family again. They decided to put these species in the same genus because of their DNA: They all have the same 56 transformations in nuclear and mitochondrial proteins and ribosomal genes. Of these species, 28 species had been in Hyla before 2005. These frogs have fringed skin on the toes of their front and back feet. Most of these frogs live in the hills and mountains in the Andes mountain range. They live as far south as Bolivia and as far north as Venezuela. A few species live in places near the Andes that are not hills are mountains. These places are called páramo. Two species (H. colymba and H. palmeri) live in Panama and Costa Rica. They live near streams where they lay their eggs. Some of the species in this genus are dying out. This is because humans change the places where they live, because of pollution, because humans brought new animals that eat the same food, because humans brought trout, whuch eat them, and because the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis makes them sick.Stuart, Hoffmann, Chanson, Cox, Berridge, Ramani and Young, editors (2008). Threatened Amphibians of the World, pp. 249–252. The first frogs in Hyloscirtus existed 51 million years ago. ==Species== There are 37 species in this genus: AmphibiaWeb also lists Hyloscirtus estevesi as its own species but the Amphibian Species of World following Barrio-Amorós and colleagues (2019) says it is the same frog as Hyloscirtus jahni. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America Category:Frogs of South America",
