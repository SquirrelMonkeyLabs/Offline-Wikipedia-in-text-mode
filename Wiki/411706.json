 "text": "The Pays de Bray is a small natural region of France. It is northeast of Rouen and is in the French départements of the Seine-Maritime and Oise. It was in the historic provinces of Normandy and Picardy since 911. The landscape is mainly bocage, a land use which has to do with its clay soil. This makes it suitable for pasture for the raising of dairy cattle. It produces famous butters and cheeses such as Neuchâtel. == Notes == == References == Category:Oise Category:Seine-Maritime",
