The main building has a Mansard roof, decorated with 5 skylight windows, which replaced a higher roof that was burned in 1741. The grounds include a French-style garden and a 10-hectare park. In 2009, the chateau was honored with the Emile Garcin-Paris Prize for work on the pigeon house, which was built in the 15th century. ==Related pages== * Communes of the Orne department ==References== ==Other websites== * INSEE * Les Comptes des Communes *Château de Villers-en- Ouche * Park of the castle of Villers Villers-en-ouche",
