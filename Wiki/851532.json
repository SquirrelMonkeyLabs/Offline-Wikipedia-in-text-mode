 "text": "Esperanto's grammar (rules of language) is meant to be simple. The rules in Esperanto never change and can always be applied in the same way. == Articles == Esperanto has only definite article la (the same thing as \"the\" in English) and no indefinite article (the same thing as \"a\" or \"an\" in English). They use definite article when they talk about things, about which they have already told something. == Nouns, adjectives, adverbs == Nominative Accusative Singular -o -on Plural -oj -ojn Nouns end with -o. For example, patro means father. To make a noun plural add -j. For example: patroj means fathers. Nominative Accusative Singular -a -an Plural -aj -ajn Adjectives end with -a, adverbs end with -e, for example granda means big, bona means good, bone means well. The -n ending is the mark of the direct object (the Accusative case) in nouns and adjectives. For example: * Mi vidas vin. - I see you. * Li amas ŝin. - He loves her. * Ili havas belan domon. - They have a nice house. In adjectives and adverbs is comparison made by words pli (more) and plej (most). For example: * pli granda - bigger * plej granda - biggest * pli rapide - faster * plej rapide - fastest == Pronouns == Singular Plural First person First person mi (I) ni (we) Second person Second person ci (thou singular) vi (you singular or plural) Third person Masculine li (he) ili (they) Third person Feminine ŝi (she) Third person Neuter ĝi (it) Uncertain Uncertain oni (\"one“) Reflexive si (self) * Personal pronouns are: mi - I, ci - thou singular, li - he, ŝi - she, ĝi - it, ni - we, vi - you singular or plural, ili - they, oni - one/they, si (self). The pronoun oni is used for uncertain subject (like man in German). The pronoun ci means thou but people do not use it much. Instead they use vi, almost exclusively, as the singular form of you, or the plural form - you all. * Possessive pronouns are made by adding of ending -a to a personal pronoun: mia - my, cia - your singular, lia - his, ŝia - her, ĝia - its, nia - our, via - your plural, ilia - their. People use possessive pronouns like adjectives. * Accusative case (the -n ending) is used in pronouns as well: min - me, cin - thee, lin - him, ŝin - her, ĝin - it, nin - us, vin - you or you all, ilin - them. As noted with ci, cin is very seldom used in modern spoken Esperanto. So, to say how old somebody is in Esperanto, just say: * Lia aĝo estas dudek = He is twenty (20) years old. (word for word: His age is twenty (20).) == Verbs == Indicative mood Active participle Passive participle Infinitive Jussive mood Conditional mood Past tense -is -int- -it- -i -u -us Present tense -as -ant- -at- Future tense -os -ont- -ot- Verbs end with -as when they are in present tense. English uses I am, you are, he is. But in Esperanto, there is just one word for am, are, is - estas. Similarly, kuras can mean run or runs. Infinitives end with -i. For example, esti means to be, povi means to can. It is easy to make past tense - always add -is ending. To make future tense, add -os. For example: * kuri - to run * mi kuras - I run * vi kuras - you run * li kuris - he ran * ĝi kuros - it will run Many words can be made opposite by adding mal at the beginning. * bona = good. malbona = bad * bone = well, malbone = poorly * granda = big, malgranda = small * peza = heavy, malpeza = light Examples of sentences which show the rules: * = I can run fast. * = You cannot run fast. * = I am a boy. * = I am a bad Esperantist. === Yes/No questions === To make a yes-or-no question, add Ĉu at the beginning. For example: * = Do you speak Esperanto? * = Yes, I speak Esperanto very well. * = No, I am a beginner. Unlike in English, they can answer to a yes/no question only jes (yes) or ne (no). == Numbers == The numbers are: 0 nul 1 unu 2 du 3 tri 4 kvar 5 kvin 6 ses 7 sep 8 ok 9 naŭ 10 dek 100 cent 1000 mil Numbers like twenty-one (21) are made by their compounding by order of magnitude. For example: dek tri means thirteen (13), dudek tri means twenty-three (23), sescent okdek tri means six hundred eighty-three (683), mil naŭcent okdek tri means (one) thousand nine hundred and eighty-three (1983). == Prefixes and suffixes == Esperanto has over 20 special words which can change the meaning of another word. People put them before or after the root of a word. These words combined can make very long words, such as malmultekosta (cheap), vendredviandmanĝmalpermeso (prohibition of eating a meat on Friday). === Prefixes === Prefixes are added before the root of the word. * bo- – means \"in-law\".
