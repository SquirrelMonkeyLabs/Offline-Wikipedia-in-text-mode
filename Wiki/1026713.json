 "text": "Healthcare in Switzerland covers everyone. It is regulated by the Swiss Federal Law on Health Insurance. It is not run by the government. Private health insurance is compulsory for everyone who lives in Switzerland (within three months of moving in or being born in the country). People have to pay part of the cost of their treatment. Insurers have to offer basic insurance to everyone, whatever their age or medical condition. Some people get help from the government to pay. There are both public and privately owned hospitals. Some of the private hospitals are subsidised by the government. People in hospital have to pay Â£12 a day. Switzerland spends more on healthcare per person than any country apart from the USA. 26% of total health spending comes directly from the patients. == References == Category:Switzerland Switzerland",
