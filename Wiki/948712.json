 "text": "The Nipmuc or Nipmuck people are Native Americans originally from present-day Massachusetts and parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island. They are from the Northeastern Woodlands culture. Their language is in the Eastern Algonquian language family. They did hunting, fishing and farming (mostly corn). They moved for different seasons. Family groups lived in villages. They were led by chiefs. These villages were often not allied with other Nipmuc villages. Villages allied with stronger neighbors like the Mohegan or Massachuset. Many Natives died from European diseases. Nipmuc supported Metacomet in King Philip's War. Many were forced to stay in Boston Harbor. Others were killed or forced into slavery. The Puritan missionary John Eliot converted Natives and created praying towns. The state of Massachusetts recognizes the Nipmuc people. == References == Category:Native Americans",
