 "text": "Elasmobranchii is a subclass of the Chondrichthyes or cartilaginous fish. It includes the modern sharks and the rays and skates. == Evolution == Fossilised shark teeth are known from the early Devonian, around 400 million years ago. During the following Carboniferous period, the sharks underwent a period of diversification, with many new forms evolving. Many of these became extinct during the Permian, but the remaining sharks underwent a second burst of adaptive radiation during the Jurassic, around which time the skates and rays first appeared. ==Taxonomy== *Subclass Elasmobranchii **†Plesioselachus **†Order Squatinactiformes **†Order Protacrodontiformes **†Infraclass Cladoselachimorpha ***†Order Cladoselachiformes **†Infraclass Xenacanthimorpha ***†Order Xenacanthiformes **Infraclass Euselachii (sharks and rays) ***†Order Ctenacanthiformes ***†Division Hybodonta ****†Order Hybodontiformes ***Division Neoselachii ****Subdivision Selachii (Selachimorpha) (modern sharks) *****Superorder Galeomorphi ******Order Heterodontiformes (bullhead sharks) ******Order Orectolobiformes (carpet sharks) ******Order Lamniformes (mackerel sharks) ******Order Carcharhiniformes (ground sharks) *****Superorder Squalomorphi ******Order Hexanchiformes (frilled and cow sharks) ******Order Squaliformes (dogfish sharks) ******†Order Protospinaciformes ******Order Squatiniformes (angel sharks) ******Order Pristiophoriformes (sawsharks) ****Subdivision Batoidea (rays) ******Order Torpediniformes (electric rays) ******Order Pristiformes (sawfishes) ******Order Rajiformes (skates and relatives) ******Order Myliobatiformes (stingrays and relatives) ==References== Category:Cartilaginous fish",
