 "text": "\"Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50)\" is a song by Canadian rapper Drake. The song was officially released on April 19, 2024 and was first leaked on April 13, 2024. The song is a diss song towards many people in the hip hop industry including Kendrick Lamar, Future, Metro Boomin, The Weeknd, and Rick Ross. Basketball player Ja Morant is also dissed in the song. When the song was leaked, many people thought the song was artificial intelligence at first but it was later confirmed to be real. ==Background== The feud between Drake and Lamar goes back to 2013 when Lamar mentioned Drake along with others by name and said \"I got love for you all but I'm trying to murder you niggas.\" The two would then subliminally diss each other for years after. J. Cole would shoutout Lamar in Drake's 2023 song \"First Person Shooter\". In the song he said that the \"Big Three\" of hip hop was Drake, Lamar and himself. Lamar didn't agree and would respond to this on his \"Like That\" feature by rapping \"Motherfuck the big three, nigga, it's just big me\". He also compared his rivalry with Drake to Michael Jackson and Prince, stating that Prince outlived Jackson. J Cole would release a diss song called \"7 Minute Drill\" in response but later removed it and apologized. ==Song== In the song, Drake responds to all the disses that have been thrown at him by multiple rappers. The song starts with Drake responding to Future by saying he had to give him his first #1 hit song (\"Way 2 Sexy\"). Drake then responds to Lamar's diss by saying that he's short (\"How the fuck you big steppin’ with a size 7 men’s on?\"), a reference to Lamar's 2022 album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers and he wouldn't take his chains. Drake also claims that Lamar's old label Top Dawg Entertainment was taking 50% of Lamar's profits and told him to do pop songs with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift. He goes after Lamar's streaming numbers, saying SZA, Travis Scott, and 21 Savage all have more streams. Drake flips Lamar's Michael Jackson-Prince line by saying \"What’s a Prince to a King? He a son, nigga\" Drake dismisses Metro Boomin, saying \"Metro, shut yo hoe ass up and make some drums, nigga.\" Before moving on to dissing The Weeknd. Telling him that he isn't from the 6ix and that his manager is spending his money. Drake then moves on to dissing Rick Ross by mentioning his past as a correctional officer, the fact that he was about to turn 50 years old and that all his number one hits were because they were features on Drake songs. He would diss professional basketball player Ja Morant before reminding Lamar that he is superior in streaming numbers and wealth. ==References== Category:2024 songs Category:Drake (musician) songs Category:Diss tracks Category:Hip hop songs",
