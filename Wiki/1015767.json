 "text": "\"Let's Go Brandon\" is a political slogan and Internet meme used as a substitute for \"Fuck Joe Biden\". The phrase is used by critics and to make fun of Joe Biden, the 46th president of the United States. ==Background== The phrase began when people chanting \"Fuck Joe Biden\" began during sporting events in early September 2021. On October 2, 2021, during a televised interview with the Sparks 300 race winner Brandon Brown and NBC Sports reporter Kelli Stavast incorrectly described the chant in the background as \"Let's Go Brandon\". The slogan has become well known through use by Republican politicians and critics of Biden. While President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were taking phone calls for NORAD's Santa tracker hotline on December 24, 2021, a caller ended his chat by saying, \"Merry Christmas and let's go Brandon,\" to which President Biden smiled and responded, \"Let's go Brandon, I agree.\" ==Dark Brandon== In mid-2022, a another meaning of the phrase, \"Dark Brandon\", became a meme by supporters of Biden. \"Dark Brandon\" initially was a meme created by online progressives to mock supporters of \"Dark MAGA\". Biden's 2024 re-election campaign has also used the meme, using a picture of \"Dark Brandon\" on their website's error message page. President Biden even mentioned \"Dark Brandon\" during the 2023 White House Correspondents Dinner. ==References== Category:Joe Biden Category:Internet memes Category:Political slogans",
