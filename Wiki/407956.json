 "text": "An epistolary novel is a novel written as a series of letters or other documents. The word epistolary comes from the Latin form of the Greek word (epistolē), meaning a letter (see epistle). The epistolary form of writing can make the story seem more realistic to the reader. This is because it is more personal, and is more like the workings of real life. Some examples of modern epistolary novels are: *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848) by Anne Brontë is written in the form of a letter from the narrator to his friend. *Dracula (1897) by Bram Stoker uses not only letters and diaries, but also newspaper accounts. *The Screwtape Letters (1942) by C. S. Lewis *Carrie (1974) by Stephen King is written in an epistolary structure, through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books *Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2007) by Jeff Kinney is written in the form a diary, including hand-written notes and cartoon drawings Category:Novels",
