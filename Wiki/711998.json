 "text": "A writ of election is a writ [rit/] issued ordering the holding of an election. In Canada, a writ is the only way of holding an election for the House of Commons. When the Government wants to or is required to dissolve Parliament, a writ of election is drawn up for each riding in Canada by the Chief Electoral Officer. They are then formally issued by the Governor General. Where a single seat becomes vacant, a writ is also issued to trigger the by-election for that seat. Category:Elections",
