 "text": "Melon Day is a holiday in Turkmenistan that has happened since 1994, on the second Sunday every August. It celebrates the Turkmenbashi melon (named after the country's first president's preferred name), a crossbreed muskmelon. Its smell, taste and big size are praised. In the capital of Ashgabat, there are a big display of all versions of the fruit and dance and music events. In 2004, Saparmurat Niyazov told farmers \"Almighty God has turned Turkmen soil into a fertile source of an abundance of the tastiest fruits. Among them are Turkmen melons, which are the result of farmers' hard work and which have a unique taste reminiscent of the fruit of paradise.\" Newspapers say he has said \"The Turkmen melon is the source of our pride. Its taste has no equals in the world, the smell makes your head spin.\" Melon Day is one of the 24 public holidays in Turkmenistan. Normal titles for these include Drop of Water is a Grain of Gold Festival, Festival of the Poetry of Magtymguli, Good Neighborliness Day, Racing Horse Day, and Carpet Day. ==Related pages== *Public holidays in Turkmenistan ==References== ==Other websites== *Niyazov's address on the occasion of the Turkmen Melon Day *Turkmen leader inspires devotion to melon BBC, August 11, 2003. *Turkmenistan celebrates 'Melon Day' UPI, August 11, 2002. *Turkmenistan celebrates Melon Day Al Jazeera, August 23, 2005.
