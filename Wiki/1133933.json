 "text": "A blue supergiant (BSG) is a hot, luminous star, also called an OB supergiant. They are usually thought to be those with luminosity class I and spectral class B9 or earlier, although sometimes A-class supergiants are also called blue supergiants. They are bigger than the Sun but smaller than a red supergiant, with surface temperatures of 10,000â€“50,000 K and luminosities from about 10,000 to a million times that of the Sun. They might form when two stars merge together. == Related pages == * Red supergiant * Supergiant * Luminosity == References == Category:Stars Category:Types of stars",
