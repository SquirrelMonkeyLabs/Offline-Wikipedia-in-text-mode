 "text": "The green bush frog (Philautus bunitus) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia in western Sabah. People have seen it near Pakka Cave and near Mount Kinabalu. People have seen it between 640 and 1800 meters above sea level. This frog is not in danger of dying out, even though it doesn't live in a very large place. This is because most of the frog's home has two protected parks in it: Kinabalu and Crocker Range National Parks. There, human beings are not allowed to change the things the frog needs or harm the frog. In some places, tourists travel to hear this frog for fun. The frog sits on branches 2 to 5 meters above the ground, so human beings hear them more than they see them. Scientists think this frog hatches from its egg as a young frog and not a swimming tadpole. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
