A Saxon defencive mound existed in Bridgnorth as early as 912. Earliest names for Bridgnorth include Brigge, Brug and Bruges, all referring to its position on the Severn. In 1101, the town was founded when Robert of BellÃªme, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury built a castle and a church here. The town was attacked and burnt in 1322. During the English Civil War, in 1646, Oliver Cromwell and his cavaliers attacked roundhead Bridgnorth. By the time the castle was in ruins, the entire town was on fire. After a three-week siege, Cromwell was successful and he ordered that the castle be demolished in 1647.Bridgnorth Castle , ShropshireTourism.co.uk, accessed May 2010 == References == Category:Towns in Shropshire Category:Civil parishes in Shropshire",
