 "text": "The Devil May Cry series is a hack and slash video game series where the player fights demons using both melee weapons and firearms. The video game series has five main games and one reboot game. For most of the series, the player plays as Dante, a demon-hunter who is half-human and half-demon. The player earns upgrades, learns new moves, and buys power-ups using Red Orbs, items the player gets by exploring the level and killing enemies. The player gets more Red Orbs from enemies by getting a higher Style Ranking. The player increases their Style Ranking by killing multiple enemies quickly without getting hurt and by using many different attacks in a short amount of time. The first Devil May Cry game was supposed to be Resident Evil 4. However, the game became so different from earlier Resident Evil games that the development team decided that the game should be a new IP instead of a Resident Evil game. The first Devil May Cry game sold well and got good reviews. Due to the game's popularity, it had several sequels and inspired other hack and slash games like Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Despite the first game getting good reviews, the sequel, Devil May Cry 2, got poor reviews. This was due to the game being subpar because it was handed to several game studios instead of just one. The last game studio had a very short amount of time to complete Devil May Cry 2, so they patched together a mediocre game. Nonetheless, since the second game sold well and there was enough money to make Devil May Cry 3, which got many good reviews, although it got some criticisms for being such a difficult game. Many people refunded the game due to it having such a steep difficulty spike, specifically on the Cerberus boss fight. Devil May Cry 4 also got good reviews, and the difficulty was made a little easier so that more people could enjoy it, but it was criticized for reusing levels instead of making more levels. Worried that the game series could lose its appeal to video game players if it did not change the game series much, Capcom hired a British game developer named Ninja Theory to reboot the game series with DmC: Devil May Cry. The game was loosely based on the story of the earlier games, but the game had a much darker tone and Dante's look and personality was changed a lot. While the game got positive reviews from professional critics, it was criticized very heavily by fans of the series, who did not like Dante's new look and personality. Due to harsh criticisms from the fans, Capcom decided to continue the original series by making the critically acclaimed Devil May Cry 5. Devil May Cry 3, Devil May Cry 4, and Devil May Cry 5 have special editions, which are re-releases that introduce new features to the games such as new playable characters.
