 "text": "Plasticity, or plastic deformation, is the ability of a solid material to have a permanent change in shape. In physics and materials science, this is called deformation. For example, a solid piece of metal being bent or pounded into a new shape shows plasticity. Permanent changes occur in the material itself. In engineering, the transition from elastic behaviour to plastic behaviour is known as yielding. == References == Category:Solid mechanics Category:Engineering Category:Materials science",
