 "text": "Sofia Mendoza (1934-2015) was an activist. She worked towards improving the East San Jose, California community. == Accomplishments == Mendoza started a group in East San Jose called “United People Arriba”. United People Arriba watched the police. They watch that people of color were treated equally to white people. She also lead a walk-out. The protest was to stop discrimination in local schools. The government counts the number of students in school to know how much money to give the school. In this walk-out, Sofia Mendoza proved that students had the power to not show up. This action could cause the school to lose money. == Death == Mendoza died at the age of 80, in Santa Clara. She was supposed to have surgery before she died. == Legacy == Mendoza died in 2015. She left behind the idea that people are always stronger when they work together in groups. Despite the fact that she left behind an important legacy, she did not receive any awards for her actions. == References == Category:1934 births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from California Category:American activists",
