 "text": "The Boring Company is a tunnel boring company founded by Elon Musk, who earlier started SpaceX. It aims to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas. It operates an underground \"Las Vegas Convention Center Loop\". Elon Musk complained via Twitter about Los Angeles traffic and the same day, December 17, 2016, founded the company. It built a short test tunnel in Los Angeles. To raise money for the expensive project, Elon Musk started selling promotional merchandise - first caps and then flamethrowers (branded as 'Not a flamethrower' to stop customs) and then fire extinguishers to go with them. The company website is written in a lighthearted tone, for example describing the fire extinguishers as 'overpriced'. == References == Category:American technology companies Category:Elon Musk Category:Companies based in California",
