 "text": "Nullarbor Plain (Latin: nullus, \"no\", and arbor, \"tree\") is an area of flat, dry land in southern Australia on the coastline of the Great Australian Bight. It is the world's largest single piece of limestone, and occupies an area of about . At its widest point, it stretches about from east to west between South Australia (SA) and Western Australia (WA). As to what causes these huge and distinctive limestone areas, no-one knows. Perhaps it is significant that one of the best-known area, the Yukatan, was in or near a hit by a huge meteorite.
