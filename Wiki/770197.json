These frogs have some webbing on their front feet and more webbing on their hind feet. They have been seen laying eggs in a roadside marsh. The scientists who first described (wrote the first formal paper about) Litoria lodesdema named it from the Latin phrase loca demissa septentrionalis domicilium habemus or \"in the lowlands of the north we have our home.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania Category:Frogs",
