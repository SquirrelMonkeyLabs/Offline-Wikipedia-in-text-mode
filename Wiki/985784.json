 "text": "A sleeper hit is a movie, song, video game, or other entertainment release that was not successful when it was released, but later on became a success. A sleeper hit may have little to no promotion. It also might not have had a successful launch until a fan of the sleeper hit gathers its attention by advertising it. Because of this its popularity increased. Examples: Foundations-Kate Nash Talk to me-Chris Andreucci ==References== Category:Entertainment",
