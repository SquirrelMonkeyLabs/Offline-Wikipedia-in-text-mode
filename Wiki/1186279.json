 "text": "Since the Gaza war began on October 7, 2023, Israel has been accused of committing war crimes. These include collective punishment of Palestinians, attacks on civilians in crowded areas (such as hospitals, schools, refugee camps, and public services), torture, executions, sexual violence, and genocide. Other accusations include forced evacuations, mistreatment of prisoners, and destruction of cultural sites. Organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, B’Tselem, Oxfam, and UN experts have reported on these actions. Israel has been legally accused of committing genocide in Gaza, including a case brought to the International Court of Justice. == Bombing Israeli hostages == On November 10, 2023, an Israeli airstrike killed three hostages—Corporal Nik Beizer, Sergeant Ron Sherman, and Elia Toledano. An investigation by the IDF later found it was highly likely the airstrike caused their deaths. The IDF said they didn’t know the hostages were in the tunnel complex they targeted. ==References==",
