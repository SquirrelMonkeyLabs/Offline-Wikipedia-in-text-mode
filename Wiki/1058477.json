In Hindu mythology, wasting food is considered a bad sign; the Temple crew follows the same. A total number of people visiting the temple varies between 2,000 to 200,000 people every day. Miraculously, the Parsadam prepared every day is never wasted, not even a bite. The most interesting Buddhist claim has to do with an unknown substance called â€œBrahma\" that lies inside the navel of the main idol, Jagannath. Hindus say that it was the original blue stone, but Buddhists say that this Brahma is Buddha's tooth relic that was brought from Kushi Nagar, where he died, to Puri.
