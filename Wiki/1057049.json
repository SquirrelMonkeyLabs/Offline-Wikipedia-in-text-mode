He wants to also make dolls when he grows up. While he's at school, he meets Marin Kitagawa after she flys into the classroom and crashes into his desk.

He decides that he will start making them at school using the sewing machine there. Wakana is surprised after Marine enters the room but she is impressed by his ability. She asks him if he can make her a cosplay outfit. She invites him over to her house and gives him an eroge game called Slippery Girls for inspiration. Wakana and Marine bond after shopping for supplies for her costume. Wakana stresses because of him trying to balance the need to create an outfit in 2 weeks for a cosplay event and midterm exams. He shows her the outfit. She loves it but also feels bad after she admits that the time limit was a lie. They go to the event and on the train ride back, Marine tells Wakana that she wants him to help create 50 more costumes which he agrees to. While at his house, Wakana finds a naked stalker trespassing in his bathroom.

They all meet her Shinju, sister at a dinner and she teaches them photography. They have a photoshoot at an abandoned hospital for Sajuna's outfit. Wakana shows up to the shoot with Shinju and both Marine and Sajuna are surprised to see her in a cosplay outfit. While shopping for another outfit for Marine, Wakana tells her that he can't help her anymore. He says that he's been seeing her different because of how revealing it is and she playfully teases him about it. They both go to the school to get Marine her math drills and he ends up saving her after she falls in the pool. She invites him to a festival and they watch fireworks.
