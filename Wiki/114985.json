His name then becomes Shaheed-e-Azam Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (\"The Great Martyr\") or sometimes Quaid-e-Awam (The Leader the Community). He was married to Nusrat Bhutto (née Ispahnie) from 1951 until his death. Their elder daughter, Benazir Bhutto (1953-2007), was also Prime Minister of Pakistan, twice.
