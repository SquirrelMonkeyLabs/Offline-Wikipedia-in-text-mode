 "text": "The Sudarshana Chakra (सुदर्शन चक्र) is a spinning, disk-like weapon literally meaning \"disk of auspicious vision,\" having 108 serrated edges used by the Hindu god [Vishnu]. The Sudarshana Chakra is generally portrayed on the right rear hand of the four hands of Vishnu, who also holds a shankha (conch shell), [Gada] (mace) and a padma (lotus).[1] While in the Rigveda the Chakra was \"[Vishnu]'s\"symbol as the wheel of time, by the late period Sudarshana Chakra emerged as an ayudhapurusha (anthropomorphic form), as a fierce form of Vishnu, used for the destruction of an enemy. In Tamil, the Sudarshana Chakra is also known as Chakkrath Azhwar (translated as Ring/Circlet of God). Category:Hindu mythology Category:Mythological weapons",
