 "text": "Anomalopidae (lanterneye fishes or flashlight fishes) are a family of fish. They have bioluminescent organs under their eyes. These light organs contain glowing bacteria. They can be \"shut off\" by the fish. It does this by either using a dark lid or by being drawn into a pouch. The organs are used to communicate, attract prey and evade predators. Flashlight fish are found in tropical ocean waters across the world. They are normally about in size. Some species can be twice this length. They are nocturnal. The fish feed at night on small crustaceans. Some species move to shallow waters near coral reefs at night. Most species are deep water fish. This tends to make research of the family difficult. They are a poorly understood group of fish. == Related pages == * Stephanoberyciformes ==References== Category:Teleosts",
