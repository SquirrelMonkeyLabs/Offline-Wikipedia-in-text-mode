 "text": "The Son Koli, or Sona Koli is a subcaste of the Koli caste found in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The Son Kolis are the original residents of what is now Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra. They practice both Hinduism and Christianity because Son Kolis were converted to Christianity during the Portuguese rule in India and worship Our Lady of Mount and Hindu deities. Historically, the Son Kolis have been fisherman by profession. All of the islands around Mumbai are inhabited by Son Kolis. == Military == The Son Kolis were villein for Portuguese but later they were enlisted as mariners and maintained the Portuguese Navy. The British Bombay Navy in the early 18th century was largely manned by Son Kolis of Mumbai. Not only this, the Maratha Navy of Kanhoji Angre (who was also a Son Koli) was served by Son Kolis. During wartime, the Son Kolis used their own galivats to fight, so the Portuguese king built two expensive warships for the Son Kolis. == Titles == * Patil, A hereditary title held by the chief of the Son Kolis, who maintains law and order in the community. == Classification == The Son Kolis are classified as Special Backward Class by the Government of Maharashtra. == Notable people == * Kanhoji Angre, grand admiral of Maratha Navy and founder of the Colaba State and Angre dynasty * Laya Patil, fleet chief in Maratha navy of Shivaji under Kanhoji Angre == References == == Other websites == * Indian Sociology Through Ghurye, a Dictionary by S.
