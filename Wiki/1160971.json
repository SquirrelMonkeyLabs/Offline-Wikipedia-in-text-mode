 "text": "Ancient Jerico/Tell es-Sultan is a an archaeological site and former settlement located northwest of present-day Jericho in the Jordan Valley in Palestine. The World Heritage Site the property is an oval-shaped tell, or mound, that contains the prehistorical deposits of human activity, and includes the adjacent perennial spring of 'Ain es-Sultan. This article incorporates text available under the CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0 license. By the 9th to 8th millennium BC, Neolithic Ancient Jericho/Tell es-Sultan was already a sizeable permanent settlement, as expressed by surviving monumental architectural features such as a wall with a ditch and a tower. It reflects the developments of the period, which include the shifting of humanity to a sedentary communal lifestyle and the related transition to new subsistence economies, as well as changes in social organisation and the development of religious practices, testified by skulls and statues found. The Early Bronze Age archaeological material on the site provides insights into urban planning, while vestiges from the Middle Bronze Age reveal the presence of a large Canaanite city-state, equipped with an urban centre and technologically innovative rampart fortifications, occupied by a socially complex population. == References == Category:Neolithic Category:Archaeological sites in the State of Palestine",
