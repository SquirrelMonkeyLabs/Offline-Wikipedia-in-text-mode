 "text": ": For movies of the Indian state of Karnataka, see Sandalwood (cinema). Sandalwood is a precious, fragrant and fine-structured wood, yellow in color. A special use that this wood allows is in delicate, highly detailed carving. Sandalwoods are found in India, Australia, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands and are yielded by trees of the genus Santalum. The trees are often grown in plantations. The entire trees are used for extracting a fragrant oil, sandalwood oil, which is used for perfume and medicine. In religious ceremonies (such as cremations) the wood is sometimes burned for its smell, as incense. In Indonesia and Malaysia, its local name is Cendana. Category:Wood Category:Perfumery",
