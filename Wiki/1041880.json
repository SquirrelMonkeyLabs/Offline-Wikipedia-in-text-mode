 "text": "The Garibaldi, known historically also as the Catalina goldfish and marine goldfish and now commonly as the Garibaldi damselfish (Hypsypops rubicundus) is a species of bright orange fish in the damselfish family. It is found in the subtropical northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean. The English name, Garibaldi, is based on an Italian surname and is a reference to the Italian general and political figure Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose followers often wore a characteristic scarlet or red shirt. As is the case in all damselfish, male Garibaldis aggressively defend the nest site after the female lays eggs. ==Description== Adult fish in this species are orange in color. It is the largest member of the damselfish family and can grow up to in length. Young ones are more reddish, and have many small iridescent (glowing, reflective) blue spots, which they lose as they become adult. Adult Garibaldis also have a more opaque tail and dorsal fin. The Garibaldi is the official marine state fish of California and is protected in Californian coastal waters.California State Library - History and Culture - State Symbols ==Distribution and habitat== Garibaldis are found in water from a depth of up to depth, usually near rock reefs, and typically over rocky sea-bottoms. This species is native to the north-eastern subtropical parts of the Pacific Ocean, ranging from Monterey Bay, California, to Guadalupe Island, Baja California. ==Behavior== Garibaldis feed mainly on invertebrates, which they remove from the rocks. Like most damselfish, adult Garibaldis maintain a home territory. The male clears a sheltered nest site within his territory; the female then deposits eggs within the nest. The male guards the nest area until the eggs hatch, which takes 19â€“21 days. During the time period that the eggs are developing, the male Garibaldi aggressively tries to keep all other fish away from the (very edible) eggs, and will boldly attack much larger swimming creatures, including humans, to the point of biting divers in order to try to drive them away from the area where the eggs are deposited. ==In aquarium== It is peaceful during the juvenile period. But as long as the body is slightly larger, it will show territorial rights to other meek fish and compete with other small fish for territory.Youtube <> Creatures section, Damselfish - Author:Sublanding Fish[2020-06-19] ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:Pomacentridae Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean",
