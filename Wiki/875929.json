 "text": "The South West Africa People’s Organisation (, SWAPO; , SWAVO; , SWAVO), officially known as the SWAPO Party of Namibia is a political party in Namibia. It has been the most powerful party in the country since the country became independent from South Africa in 1990. It was a former independence and populist movement in South West Africa and was one of the main groups fighting in the South African Border War. ==History== ===Foundation=== SWAPO was started on 19 April 1960. The leaders named the party to show that it represented all Namibians, but the organisation is popular among Ovambo people of northern Namibia, who are nearly half the total population of South West Africa. ===South West Africa=== During 1962, SWAPO had became the main independence, anti-colonial organisation for the people in Namibia. SWAPO used guerrilla tactics to fight the colonial South African Defence Force. A major conflict broke out on 26 of August 1966, when a group of the South African Police and SWAPO forces shot at each other. This became the start of what became known in South Africa as the Border War. The neighbouring country of Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975 during the Portuguese Colonial war. The leftist Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) came to power as the main party of Angola. In March 1976, the MPLA offered SWAPO bases in Angola for launching attacks against the South African military. ===Modern Namibia=== Namibia gained its independence in 1990. SWAPO have since become the dominant political party of Namibia. ==Notable members== *Sam Nujoma *Hifikepunye Pohamba *Hage Geingob *Henock Kankoshi *Adolf Hitler Uunona *Jacob Kuhangua *Jafet Penda Ya Ndakolo *Theo-Ben Gurirab *Louis Nelengani *Nahas Angula *Lucas Nepela ==Election history== ===Presidential elections=== Election Party candidate Votes % Result 1994 Sam Nujoma 370,452 76.34% Elected 1999 Sam Nujoma 414,096 76.82% Elected 2004 Hifikepunye Pohamba 625,605 76.45% Elected 2009 Hifikepunye Pohamba 611,241 75.25% Elected 2014 Hage Geingob 772,528 86.73% Elected 2019 Hage Geingob 464,703 56.3% Elected ===National Assembly elections=== Election Party leader Votes % Seats +/– Position Result 1989 Sam Nujoma 384,567 57.33% 41 1st 1994 Sam Nujoma 370,452 76.34% 12 1st 1999 Sam Nujoma 414,096 76.82% 2 1st 2004 Sam Nujoma 625,605 76.44% 1st 2009 Hifikepunye Pohamba 611,241 75.25% 1 1st 2014 Hifikepunye Pohamba 785,671 86.73% 23 1st 2019 Hage Geingob 536,861 65.45% 14 1st ===National Council elections=== Election Seats +/– Position Result 1992 19 1st 1998 2 1st 2004 3 1st 2010 1st 2015 16 1st 2020 12 1st == References == Category:Political parties in Namibia Category:Communist parties Category:Social democratic parties Category:Socialist International Category:1960 establishments in Africa Category:20th-century establishments in Namibia",
