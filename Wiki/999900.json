 "text": "The 1906 United Kingdom general election was held from 12 January to 8 February 1906. The Liberals, led by Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman, won a big majority at the election. The Conservatives led by Arthur Balfour, who had been in government until the month before the election, lost more than half their seats, including Balfour's own seat in Manchester East. This left the party with its fewest recorded seats ever in history. ==References== Category:United Kingdom general elections Category:1906 in Europe",
