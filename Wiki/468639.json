He tells her to locate a video camera which is hidden inside her closet. He tells her to watch the videos and to call him back.

Dr. Nasch also tells her that she lost her memory after she was attacked and left for dead at a nearby airport hotel. Christine wonders why Ben lied to her about the accident.
