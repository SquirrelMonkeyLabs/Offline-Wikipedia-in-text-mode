 "text": "The flag of Liguria is one of the official symbols of the region of Liguria, Italy. The current flag was adopted on 7 July 1997. ==Symbolism== Each color has the following meaning: * The green represents the Ligurian Alps and the Ligurian Apennines; * The red represents the blood shed for Italian unification; * The blue represents the Ligurian Sea. At the center of the flag is the coat of arms of Liguria: a stylized caravel, symbolizing the maritime traditions of the region and its great navigators, positioned below the historical flag of the Republic of Genoa (the current flag of the modern-day city of Genoa). The four six-pointed stars imposed on the Genovese flag represent the four provinces of Liguria: the Province of Genoa, the Province of Imperia, the Province of La Spezia, and the Province of Savona. === Gallery === File:Flag of the Marquisate of Finale (12th century-1602).svg|Marquisate of Finale File:Flag of the Republic of Noli.svg|Republic of Noli File:Flag of Genoa.svg|Flag of the Republic of Genoa (1005â€“1797), and the current flag of the modern-day city of Genoa.
