 "text": "Penetrating trauma is an injury that occurs when an object pierces the skin and enters a tissue of the body, creating an open wound. The penetrating object may remain in the tissues, come back out the way it entered, or pass through the tissues and exit from another area. An injury in which an object enters the body or a structure and passes all the way through is called a perforating injury, while penetrating trauma implies that the object does not pass through. ==References== Category:Injuries",
