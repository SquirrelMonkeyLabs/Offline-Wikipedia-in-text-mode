 "text": "Isabel Toledo (born Maria Isabel Izquierdo; April 9, 1960 – August 26, 2019) was a Cuban-American fashion designer based in New York City. Quote: Ms. Toledo’s tunics and sundresses, by contrast, will probably find fewer customers. They were complex in color and pattern, surprising in their design, and for that reason more interesting. She was born in Camajuaní, Cuba. Her career was based in New York City. She was known for designing Michelle Obama's first inaugural dress. Toledo died at a Manhattan hospital on August 26, 2019 from breast cancer at the age of 59. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from breast cancer Category:American fashion designers Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Cancer deaths in New York City Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States",
