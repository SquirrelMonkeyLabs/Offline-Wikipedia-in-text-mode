The shrine is unique in that it has no main building, but instead uses the mountain itself as a Kannabi, or a rock as an Iwakura. It is located in a valley between Mount Yudono and Shinakurasan Mountain. Yudonosan is the final destination in the Shugendo pilgrimage between all the mountains and is also associated with meeting potential spouses. The mountain itself, Mount Yudono, is highly regarded as a training ground for ascetic discipline, and many yamabushi and ascetics believe that their pilgrimage is not complete until they reach the summit of Mount Yudono. The mountain is known for its goshintai, a sacred object believed to be connected to a god..Earhart, H. Byron. (1965). Four ritual periods of Haguro shugendo in northeastern Japan.
