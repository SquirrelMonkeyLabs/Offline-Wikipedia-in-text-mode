 "text": "The Nintendo Switch (known as NX before its release) is a video game console created by Nintendo. It is the successor to the Wii U and was released on March 3, 2017. The Switch is a hybrid console, similar to the lesser known Sega Nomad. The player can either connect it to a television or use it by itself as a handheld gaming device. It uses controllers called Joy-Cons, which can attach to both sides of the console. They can be attached to a grip when playing on a TV. The Joy-Con also have a feature known as HD Rumble, which allows for immersive vibration of the controllers. There is an infrared sensor on the bottom of the right Joy-Con that can detect shapes, and distance. There are more than 1000 games for the Nintendo Switch. Some notable titles include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and Pokémon Sword and Shield, with new titles coming out for the Nintendo Switch such as Mario + Rabbids: Sparks Of Hope. ==Background== In 2012, Nintendo released the Wii U, but it was a complete failure selling only 13.56 million units. It remains the worst-selling mainline console Nintendo has released. However, Nintendo's handheld console, the Nintendo 3DS, was selling quite well. In 2017, the Nintendo Switch was launched through a trailer. The Wii U would end up being discontinued before the Switch even came out. Most Wii U games have been ported and/or upgraded on the Switch, with games like Mario Kart 8 and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze being some notable ones. == Reception == The Nintendo Switch received widespread acclaim. The Switch became the fastest-selling console, outselling the Wii U in only nine months. In May 2020, it was announced that the Nintendo Switch had sold over 107 million consoles since its release. As of November 2020, the Switch is the best-selling Nintendo home console. On 6 May 2021, Nintendo Switch sold more units than the Nintendo 3DS, with 84.59 million units. One major complaint about the console relates to the Joy-Con controllers and a frequent \"stick-drift\" issue. \"Stick-drift\" is when the joystick receives input that the user doesn't initiate, causing the stick to \"drift\" in a direction not intended. Common reasons for this issue is wear and tear on the contact pads responsible for interpreting input and dirt. The Switch sold over 132.5 million units as of November 2023. According to an extrapolation, the Switch is going to be the best-selling console of all time. ==Models== Original Model The original Switch model had an LCD screen and had 32GB of internal memory. It costs $299. Lite version A version called the Nintendo Switch Lite was released on September 20, 2019. It costs less and is smaller than a normal Nintendo Switch, doesn't use wires or anything and is a standalone device, but can not connect to a television like the normal Nintendo Switch and does not have detachable Joy-Con. Some games require an additional Joy-Con to play them. OLED model The Nintendo Switch OLED Model is an upgraded version of the Switch that has a 7-inch OLED display, improved speakers, a larger and more adjustable stand, 64 GB of internal storage and a dock that includes a LAN cable port was announced by Nintendo on July 6, 2021. It was released on October 8, 2021 with a price of $349.99 (£309.99). ==Accessories== The Nintendo Switch has several accessories. Nintendo Labo is a series of cardboard add-ons which the user builds to play games with. Ring Fit Adventure includes a circular piece of rubber called a Ring-Con, and a leg strap. Similar to the Wii, the Switch also has a wheel shaped holder for the Joy-Con. ==Hardware== The original model of the Nintendo Switch has a 720p LCD screen, 1.02 GHz quad-core CPU, 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage. The OLED model has the same CPU and amount of RAM, but with an OLED screen and 64 GB of storage. ==References== Category:2017 establishments Category:Nintendo video game consoles",
