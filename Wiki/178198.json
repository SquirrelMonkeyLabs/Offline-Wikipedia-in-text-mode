 "text": "The Babri Mosque (; ) (Transliteration:Babri Masjid ) or Mosque of Babur was a mosque in Ayodhya, India. It was constructed by order of the first Mughal emperor of India, Babur, in Ayodhya in the 16th century. Statues of Hindu deities were kept in the mosque overnight and claimed by hindus as the birth place of lord Rama. Later, the site was declared disputed by the court. The mosque was destroyed in 1992 when a rally of Hindu extremists and nationalists entered in Ayodhya and demolished it. After the demolition of the Babri Mosque there was violence between Muslims and Hindus. On 27 September 2010 an Indian High Court (Allahabad High Court) decided that the Mosque was built on the Ram Temple which was destroyed by Babar. Allahabad High Court decided to split the site into three parts. On 22 January 2024, Ram mandir was built upon the place while muslims where given another place to build a mosque. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Mosques in India Category:Mughal architecture Category:16th-century buildings and structures Category:1520s establishments in Asia",
