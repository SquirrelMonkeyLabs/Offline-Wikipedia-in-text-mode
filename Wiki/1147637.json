 "text": "Old Hindi (Old Hindi: It was spoken by the peoples of the Hindi belt, especially around Delhi, in roughly the 13thâ€“15th centuries. It is attested in only a handful of literature, including some works by the poet Amir Khusrau, verses by the poet-saint Namdev, and some verses by the Sufi saint Baba Farid in the Adi Granth. The works of Kabir also may be included, as they use a Khariboli-like dialect. Old Hindi was originally written in Devanagari and later in the Perso-Arabic script as well. Old Hindi poetry can be found as early as 769 AD. ==References== Category:Urdu dialects Category:Urdu language Category:Hindi",
