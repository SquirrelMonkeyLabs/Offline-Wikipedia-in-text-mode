It originated from China and is now widely practised in Korea. 道 Dao, also Romanized as Tao, is the \"Force\" that Taoists believe makes everything in the world. It is very mysterious, and instead of spending a lot of time trying to explain what the Tao is, Taoists focus on living a simple and balanced life in harmony with nature. This is one of the most important principles in Taoism. Taoists also believe that conflict is not good and that if you have a problem with something, it is better to find a way around it. Some important Taoists are: * 老子 Lao Zi. Some say he wrote Dào Dé Jīng. * 庄子 Zhuangzi. He wrote a book with stories that talk about Taoism. * 黄帝 Huang Di the Yellow Emperor. People say he was one of the first Taoists, but it is disputed whether he even existed or not.",
