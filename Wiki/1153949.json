 "text": "Pump.Fun is an Internet platform that allows users to create crypto- currencies. It was founded in the United States. It charges a 1% fee on sales. It was set up to be easy, cheap and secure from built-in sub-programs that can steal from memecoin purchasers. \"The idea was to give people a safer way to trade memecoins by standardizing the underlying code, which prevents developers from building in malicious mechanisms to steal funds, in whatâ€™s known as a hard rug pull.\" Pump.Fun went online in January 2024. It has been called the fastest growing crypto platform ever. The first coin which was created for community by Pump.fun developers was COMCOIN. Despite the platform's built-in safety features to prevent theft, it has been accused of not having protection from other kinds of abuse, such as the posting of suicide threats. Pump.Fun has been banned in the United Kingdom. ==References== == Other websites == * Home-page of Pump.Fun * https://cointelegraph.com/news/fca-issues-warning-bans-pump-fun-uk * https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-bottom-and-pump-funs-fallout/ * https://cointelegraph.com/news/pump-fun-revenue-dropped-66-percent-backlash Category:Cryptocurrency Category:2024 establishments",
