 "text": "\"El Segadors\" (, ; \"The Reapers\") is the national anthem of Catalonia. ==Lyrics== ===Catalan original=== Catalan original (official) Central Catalan (Eastern) IPA North-Western Catalan (Western) IPA ===Translations=== Poetic English translation Occitan translation Spanish translation I Catalonia triumphant Shall again be rich and abundant. Drive away these folks Who are so proud and arrogant. Strike with Thy sickle! Strike with Thy sickle, Defenders of the Land! Strike with Thy sickle! II Now is the time, Reapers. Now is the time to stand wise. Let us sharpen well our means, For when another June cometh. III May the enemy tremble Upon seeing our symbol. Just as we cut the wheatâ€™s golden ears, When time calleth, we sever chains. ==References== Category:Catalonia Category:Spanish anthems",
