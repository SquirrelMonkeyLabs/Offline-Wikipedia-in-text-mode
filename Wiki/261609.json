 "text": "Team Umizoomi is an American animated children's television series. The show was on Nickelodeon from January 25, 2010 to April 24, 2015. The show follows 2 siblings: Milli and Geo, and their best robot friend: Bot. The show uses lots of mathematical ideas as numbers, sequences, shapes, songs and patterns. It is produced by Curious Pictures and Nickelodeon Animation Studios. ==Characters== * 1 2 and 3 in the early Season 1 * Austin for the thing that needs to be built, and then interact with the child viewing the show to figure out which building supplies are needed to fill in the shape belt by singing Super Shapes! * Luna who loves to sing and dance and has a fun-loving, childlike personality. His abilities are more functional than math-related. His arms and legs can be extended to reach things, by saying \"Arms Extendo\" or \"Legs Extendo\". He has a small Milli (like a satellite dish) on his head to receive calls (called the Umi Alarm). He also has a screen on his front (called a \"Belly Belly Belly Screen\") that they can see videos/pictures on as well as have a video call with someone who needs their help. He also has a storage compartment on the back of his body, called a Bot-o-mat, which frequently is carrying whatever the team happens to need. In each episode, he is introduced, usually by Milli, as their Best Robot Friend. * UmiCar is the team's orange car that talks by only his name, provided by P.T. Walkey, who drives the team wherever their help is needed. He also beeps. UmiCar has been shown as not being a character in many early season 1 episodes, but since he gained a face, becomes a character rather than an object. ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2010)=== #The Kite Festival — January 25, 2010 #The Aquarium Fix It — January 26, 2010 #Carnival — January 27, 2010 #Picnic — January 28, 2010 #Super Trip to the Supermarket — January 29, 2010 #Subway Heroes — February 1, 2010 #The Milk Out — February 2, 2010 #The Dinosaur Museum Mishap — February 3, 2010 #The Rolling Toy Parade — February 4, 2010 #Special Delivery — February 12, 2010 #Ready for Take Off — February 19, 2010 #Ice Cream Truck — April 12, 2010 #The Wild West Toy Train Show — April 13, 2010 #The Butterfly Dance Show — April 14, 2010 #The Elephant Sprinkler — April 15, 2010 #Playground Heroes — April 23, 2010 #To The Library — September 13, 2010 #Race Around Umi City — October 18, 2010 #Favorite Things Show — October 19, 2010 #The Big Boat Race — October 20, 2010 ===Season 2 (2010–2011)=== #21 Fantastic Pilot Fight — October 21, 2010 #22 Chicks in the City — October 22, 2010 #23 The Ghost Family Costume Party — October 25, 2010 #24 Santa's Little Fixers — December 6, 2010 #25 The Great UmiCar Rescue — January 10, 2011 #26 Purple Monkey Mission — January 11, 2011 #27 Day at the Museum — January 12, 2011 #28 Super Soap — January 13, 2011 #29 Counting Comet — February 25, 2011 #30 Crazy Skates — March 21, 2011 #31 Milli Saves the Day — March 22, 2011 #32 Umi Fire Truck — March 23, 2011 #33 Ellee the Elephant — March 24, 2011 #34 Umi Egg Hunt — April 15, 2011 #35 The Legend of the Blue Mermaid — May 13, 2011 #36 Shark Car — July 15, 2011 #37 The King of Numbers — October 3, 2011 #38 Umi Toy Store — October 10, 2011 #39 Buster the Lost Dog — October 17, 2011 #40 Into the Snow We Go! — November 25, 2011 ===Season 3 (2012)=== #41 Cuckoo Bears — January 16, 2012 #42 The Incredible Presto — January 17, 2012 #43 Stompasaurus — January 18, 2012 #44 Job Well Done — January 19, 2012 #45 Rainy Day Rescue — January 20, 2012 #46 The Shape Bandit — January 27, 2012 #47 Shooting Star — April 27, 2012 #48 Presto's Magic House — May 18, 2012 #49 DoorMouse in Space — May 25, 2012 #50 The Umi Games — August 13, 2012 #51 The Kitty Rescue — September 21, 2012 #52 The Great Shape Race — September 28, 2012 #53 Animal School House — October 1, 2012 #54 Doctor Bot — October 2, 2012 #55 Broadwalk Games — October 3, 2012 #56 Lost and Found Toys — October 4, 2012 #57 Let's Play Math Dragons — November 26, 2012 #58 Haircut Hijinx — November 27, 2012 #59 The Umi City Treasure Hunt — November 28, 2012 #60 A Sledding Snow Day — November 29, 2012 ===Season 4 (2013–2015)=== #61 The Boy With the Dragon Skateboard — February 4, 2013 #62 City of Lost Penguins — February 11, 2013 #63 UmiCar's Birthday Present — April 22, 2013 #64 Robo Tools — May 13, 2013 #65 The Sunshine Fairy — May 20, 2013 #66 Little Panda Joe — June 14, 2013 #67 Stolen Lunches — September 9, 2013 #68 Meatball Madness — September 16, 2013 #69 Umi Grand Prix — October 11, 2013 #70 Gloopy Fly Home — November 18, 2013 #71 Movie Madness — November 25, 2013 #72 Umi Ninjas — January 10, 2014 #73 Umi Cops — January 17, 2014 #74 Umi Knights — April 29, 2014 #75 Lost Fairy Tales in the City — May 5, 2014 #76 Sleeping UmiCar — September 8, 2014 #77 Gizmos Gone Wild — September 15, 2014 #78 Mega Quest Journey — November 28, 2014 #79 Umi Space Heroes — February 16, 2015 #80 Umi Rescue Copter — April 24, 2015 Category:Nick Jr. Category:Nicktoons Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2010s American children's television series Category:2010 American television series debuts Category:2015 American television series endings Category:English-language television programs",
