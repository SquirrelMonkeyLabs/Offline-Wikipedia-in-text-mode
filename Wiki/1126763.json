It is south of Carmel-by-the-Sea, at an elevation of 318 feet (97 m). Carmel Highlands is just south of the Point Lobos State Reserve, and serves as the northern gateway of the Big Sur coastline along California State Route 1. Carmel Highlands was founded in 1916 by developers Frank Hubbard Powers and James Franklin Devendorf and the Carmel Development Company. ==History== In 1906, the Carmel Development Company purchased of land from the local ranchers south of Point Lobos, where it developed the Carmel Highlands. In 1915, Frank Devendorf developed the Carmel Highlands as a residential community of creative people dedicated to the arts. Devendorf and his foreman, Frank DeAmaral developed the area with the Highlands Inn as a resort hotel at the center of the development. He planted pine trees and laid out the roads and building sites. His friend, marine artist William Frederic Ritschel, helped him plan sight lines for the hotel that had views north along the coast. ==References== ==Other websites== * Carmel Highlands Association Category:Unincorporated communities in California Category:Northern California Category:Settlements in Monterey County, California",
