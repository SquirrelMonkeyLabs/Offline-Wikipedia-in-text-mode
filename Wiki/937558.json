 "text": "Sphaenorhynchus is a genus of frogs. They are in the family Hylidae. They are the lime treefrogs or hatchet-faced treefrogs. They live in the places where water goes into the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers in South America. They live in the Guianas, Trinidad, and Brazil. Most of them live in Brazil in the Atlantic Forest. ==Systematics== Scientists think the frogs in Sphaenorhynchus are closely related to the frogs in Scarthyla and Scinax. Faivovich and other scientists (2005) put Sphaenorhynchus in the group Dendropsophini. Dendropsophus, Lysapsus, Pseudis, Scarthyla, Scinax, and Xenohyla are in Dendropsophini too. ==Appearance== Sphaenorhynchus are small and middle frogs in size. They are bright green or yellow green in color. Their faces come together to a point. Most frogs have skin flaps on each side of the rear end. There is some webbed skin on the front feet and more webbed skin on the back feet. Male frogs have a vocal sac on their necks so they can make sounds. ==Species== These species are in the genus Sphaenorhynchus: ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
