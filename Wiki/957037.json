It is a village of upper Ballia district in what is now Uttar Pradesh. He was born to a Hindu Brahmin family.

They rebelled because the Company brought a new weapon. It was called the Enfield Rifle. These rifles had cartridges which were greased with the fats of animals. Many Indian soldiers believed that the grease was made with cow fat which are a holy animal for Hindu. This led to the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny. Pandey shot two British officers. He was tried in a military court. He was accused of working against Company. He was hanged on 8 April 1857 at Barrackpore in Bengal Presidency. == References == == Other websites == * * * * Man who led the mutiny == Further reading == * Amin, Agha H., The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857-59: Reinterpreted, 1998, Strategicus and Tacticus * Mukherjee, Rudrangshu, Mangal Pandey: Brave Martyr or Accidental Hero?, 2005, Penguin Books (India), Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2022 Category:1827 births Category:1857 deaths Category:Indian revolutionaries",
