 "text": "Gorillaz are an animated British rock band. The band was invented by Damon Albarn, a member of the band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, who has worked on the comic book series Tank Girl. Even though the band members are fictional, they have released a large number of albums and music videos. The band's animated members are 2-D, Noodle, Russell Hobbs, and Murdoc Niccals. The band's genre is mostly a combination of alternative rock, alternative hip hop, and electronica. It also has elements of experimental, trip hop, dub, and psychedelic rock. ==Live performances== Since they are an animated group, they cannot perform live, like other bands can. At Gorillaz concerts, the real members of the band stand behind screens which show computer-generated images of the animated group performing. Despite the animated performances, the actual band members did go on tour as the Gorillaz (which the animated band referred to as that Gorillaz tribute band), playing at various venues across the states, headlining at Coachella. The live Gorillaz band played at the 2010 Glastonbury Festival, performing in place of u2 due to Bono's emergency back surgery. Nevertheless, they were a hit with the crowd. ==List of albums== ===Studio albums=== *Gorillaz (2001) *Demon Days (2005) *Plastic Beach (2010) *The Fall (2010) *Humanz (2017) *The Now Now (2018) *The Song Machine, Season 1: Strange Timez (2020) *Cracker Island (2023) ===Compilation albums=== *G-Sides (2002) *Laika Come Home (with Spacemonkeyz) (2002) *D-Sides (2007) *The Singles Collection 2001â€“2011 (2011) ==References== Category:1998 establishments in England Category:1990s British music groups Category:2000s British music groups Category:2010s British music groups Category:Animated characters Category:English rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Musical groups from Essex Category:Warner Bros.
