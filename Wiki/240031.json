 "text": "Zanesville is a city in and the county seat of Muskingum County, Ohio, United States. The population was 24,765 at the 2020 census. It was founded by Ebenezer Zane. Zane had constructed Zane's Trace, a pioneer road through present-day Ohio. He settled in the area in 1797 with his son-in-law, John McIntire. They put the town at the point where Zane's Trace met the Muskingum River. From 1810-1812, the city was the second state capital of Ohio. The National Road runs through Zanesville as U.S. Route 40. Novelist Zane Grey, a descendant of the Zane family, was born in the city. The city has two engineering landmarks: the Muskingum River Canal, designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark; and the Zanesville Y-Bridge, the only such structure in the United States still in use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==TV station== Zanesville has 2 TV stations WHIZ- TV and WOUC-TV ==References== ==Other websites== * City of Zanesville's official website * Zanesville and Muskingum County, Ohio * Zanesville Ohio Community Directory * Zanesville Tourism site * Zanesville-Muskingum County Chamber of Commerce * John McIntire Library website * South Branch Library website * Downtown Zanesville Artist Colony website Category:Cities in Ohio Ohio Category:County seats in Ohio Category:1790s establishments in the Northwest Territory Category:1797 establishments in the United States",
