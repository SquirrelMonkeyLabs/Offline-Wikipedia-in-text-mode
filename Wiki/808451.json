 "text": "Scouse (; sometimes called Liverpool English or Merseyside English) is an accent and dialect of English beginning in the northwest county of Merseyside. It originated mostly from Irish (from the Irish Potato Famine) and Welsh immigrants. The Scouse accent is very noticeable and is not similar with those of the neighbouring regions. The accent is named after the stew scouse, which Liverpudlians eat a lot. Liverpool's accent is often thought to be informal, like most of the \"Northern\" English accents. The accent can now be found in areas close to Liverpool, like Widnes and Runcorn, because Liverpool was developed a lot in the 1950s. A lot of different types of the accent exist, for example, the Northern accent, which is different from the southern accent. == Words it uses == * Abar: About * Antwacky: Old-fashioned * Arl arse: Unfair/mean * Aul fella: Father * Bail/ Bail it: To leave or decide to not do something * Baltic: Freezing * Barnet: Hair * Barneted: On drugs * Be arsed: Can't be bothered * Beak/lemo: Cocaine * Bevvy: Alcoholic drink * Bevvied: Drunk * Bezzy: Best friend * Bifter/ciggy: Cigarette * Bird: Girlfriend * Bizzy: Police officer * Blag: Fake * Blueshite: Used by Liverpool fans to talk to Everton or its fans * Boss: Great * Brass/Brass House: Prostitute/Brothel * Brekkie: Breakfast * Butty: Sandwich * Chocka: Heavily populated/busy * Clobber: Clothes * Clocked/Clocked it: To notice or see something * Cob on: Bad mood * Da: Father * Dead: Very * Devoed: Devastated * Divvy: Idiot * Gary: Ecstasy pill.
