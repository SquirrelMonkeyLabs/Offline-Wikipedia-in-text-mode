 "text": "Pop icon is a celebrity whose popularity stays the same or even increases as time goes by. Most pop icons achieve their status through death, typically at a young age. The worship of pop icons is due only in part to their actual accomplishments. Some of the most notable pop icons are Whitney Houston, James Dean, Việt Hùng, Michael Jackson, John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley. Death nearly always increases the fame of a pop icon. Many people respect the dead. Others feel a close personal connection with the dead icon and want to remember the celebrity. Death also increases any value of all items that belonged to the pop icon. == Pop icons == * ABBA * Aerosmith * Christina AguileraKim, Esther (March 7, 2011). \"Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera in 2011\". seventeen.com.
