 "text": "When a person needs to get away from a fire, inside a building or a tunnel, they need to do this quickly. For this reasons, fire escapes are installed, and signaled. Very often fire escapes are separate stairways, often outside the building. The first fire escape was invented in England by Daniel Maseres, in 1784. Such installations are most common in the United States, particularly in metropolitan areas. Category:Firefighting Category:Safety",
