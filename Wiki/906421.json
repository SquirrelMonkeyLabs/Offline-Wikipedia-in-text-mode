 "text": "Havilah is a land mentioned a few times in the Bible. No one is sure where it is located, although some suggestions include southern Arabian Peninsula, Horn of Africa, and even as far as Libya. In the Book of Genesis (Chapter 2), one of the rivers that flows out of the Garden of Eden, the Pishon river, flows through Havilah, which is described as having gold and other precious stones. It is said to be populated by Ham's grandson and a son of Joktan, both of whom are named Havilah. Category:Bible",
