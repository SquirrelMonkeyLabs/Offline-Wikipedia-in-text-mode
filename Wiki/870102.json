 "text": "Phyllomedusa neildi is a frog that lives in Venezuela. Scientists have only seen this frog in one place: Sierra de San Lu√≠s. People have seen this frog between 550 and 1150 meters above sea level. This frog is smaller than other frogs in Phyllomedusa. The skin where its legs meet the body is striped white and pink. This frog is awake at night. It lives in forests with leaves that fall and forests with trees that are evergreen. The female frog lays 250-280 eggs at a time and pulls one or two leaves around them. Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out, but they say that the forests where it lives are in a lot of danger. Human beings take wood to burn for fuel. Humans cut down forests to make towns and farms and places for goats to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
