 "text": "In chemistry, a sulphate (sulfate US English) is a salt of sulphuric acid. The sulphate ion is a group of atoms with the formula SO4 and two negative charges. It consists of a central sulphur atom surrounded by four (equivalent) oxygen atoms. It occurs when sulphuric acid loses two hydrogens. If it only loses one, a hydrogen sulphate ion is made.
