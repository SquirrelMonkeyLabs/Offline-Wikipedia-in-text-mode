 "text": "The flag of South Africa from 1928 to 1994 was the flag of the Union of South Africa from 1928 to 1961 and the flag of the Republic of South Africa to 1994. It was also the flag of South West Africa (now Namibia) to 1990, when that territory was under South African administration. The design features three horizontal bands of orange, white and blue with three small flags (the flag of the United Kingdom to the left, the vertical version of the flag of the Orange Free State in the centre and the flag of the South African Republic to the right) centered on the white band. Because of its colours it was known as the Oranje, Blanje, Blou (Afrikaans for Orange, White, Blue) by citizens. The flag is viewed as a symbol of apartheid and white supremacy, since 2019 it is illegal to display this flag in public in South Africa and is classified as a hate speech. This ruling is seen as a political move on the part of the ANC government, who has been ruling the country since 1994. The banning of the Oranje, Blanje, Blou is challenged by many in the South African Supreme Court of Appeal. In 2023, the ban was partially upheld by the Supreme Court which ruled that \"gratuitous\" display was unlawful but did not rule on if private display was unlawful. ==Gallery== Flag of South Africa (1928–1982, Prince's Flag).svg|Prince's Flag Flag of South Africa (1928–1982, small flags).svg|Flags of the United Kingdom, Orange Free State and South African Republic ==References== Category:Historical flags Category:1928 establishments Category:1994 disestablishments Category:Apartheid Category:Controversies Category:South African flags Category:National symbols of South Africa",
