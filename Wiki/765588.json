Outside the 50 states, there is a store located in Guam and one in Panama. The chain is recognizable by the A-frame style roofs of its older restaurants, similar to the original structures used by IHOP, Tastee-Freez, Nickerson Farms, and Whataburger. Structures that have been converted from Wienerschnitzels into other restaurants often retain the distinctive architecture. The chain's advertising mascot is an anthropomorphized chili dog known as The Delicious One, who runs from people who want to eat him.'The Delicious One' speaks in new TV spots for Wienerschnitzel Wienerschnitzel sponsors the tongue-in-cheek Wiener Nationals, the de facto national dachshund racing championship series for the United States. ==Related pages== * List of hot dog restaurants ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:American fast food restaurants Category:1961 establishments in the United States Category:Companies based in California",
