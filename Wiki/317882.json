 "text": "Green chemistry (or sustainable chemistry) is a type of chemical research and engineering. It supports the design of products and processes that use as little dangerous substances as they can. Environmental chemistry is the chemistry of the natural environment and of pollutant chemicals in nature. But green chemistry wants to reduce and prevent pollution at its source. In 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act was passed in the United States. This law sought original and new ways to handle pollution. It aims to avoid problems before they happen. Green chemistry applies organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and even physical chemistry. While green chemistry seems to focus on just industrial applications, it does apply to any chemistry choice. Green chemists reduce the hazards and increase the efficiency of any chemical choice. It is distinct from environmental chemistry which focuses on chemical phenomena in the environment. == The 12 principles of green chemistry == 1\\. Prevent waste Create products without or with minimal wastes so that the wastes do not need to be taken care of afterwards. 2\\. Design safer chemicals and products Design chemicals to have little or no toxicity, without affecting effectiveness. 3\\. Design less hazardous chemical synthesis Design a way of synthesising products without it being toxic to humans or the environment. 4\\. Use renewable raw materials Use renewable raw materials, like plant materials, other than depleting ones, such as Fossil fuels. 5\\. Use catalysts, not stoichiometric reagents Use of catalysts because of their ability to be able to be reused and that they are less harmful than reagents. 6\\. Avoid chemical derivatives Chemical derivatives generate wastes that can be avoided. 7\\. Maximize atom economy Make sure that a greater percentage of the atoms present in the reactants of a chemical reaction are used in the products that are also usable. 8\\. Use safer solvents and reaction conditions Avoid using harsh solvents, but if that cannot be avoided, then use benign chemicals. 9\\. Increase energy efficiency Use the normal ambient temperature and pressure wherever possible. 10\\. Design for degradation Design materials to breakdown into benign substances by bacterial or other environmentally sound ways. 11\\. Analyse in real time to prevent pollution Monitor and control the formation of by-products during a reaction. 12\\. Minimize the potential for accidents Design chemicals to minimize the potential for accidents. ==References== ==Other websites== *EPA Green Chemistry Program Website *Introduction to Green Chemistry and Recent Literature *American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute *California Department of Toxic Substances Control, Green Chemistry Initiative *University of California, Berkeley, Program in Green Chemistry and Chemicals Policy *Center for Green Chemistry and Green Engineering at Yale University *Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence at the University of York, UK *Center for Sustainable and Green Chemistry at the Technical University of Denmark *Mediterranean Countries Green Chemistry Network *Next Generation Environmental Technologies Published by RAND *Green Chemistry at Tel Aviv University *Green Chemistry, Journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry *Green Chemistry Book Series published by the Royal Society of Chemistry *Green Chemistry Letters and Reviews, Taylor & Francis Category:Environmental chemistry",
