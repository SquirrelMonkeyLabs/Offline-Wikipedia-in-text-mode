 "text": "The 1982–83 NHL season was the 66th season of the National Hockey League. Twenty-one teams each played 80 games. Before the start of the season, the Colorado Rockies moved to East Rutherford, New Jersey where they were renamed New Jersey Devils. They were also moved to the Patrick Division, making the unwilling Winnipeg Jets to leave the Norris Division and take Colorado's place in the Smythe Division. This would be the last time an NHL team moved until 1993. The last remaining players from the Original Six era, (Carol Vadnais, Serge Savard, and Wayne Cashman) all retired after this season. Cashman was the last to play, losing in the Wales Conference Finals as a player for the Bruins. The New York Islanders won their fourth Stanley Cup in a row by beating the Edmonton Oilers four games to none. No team in any major professional North American sport has won four championships in a row since the Islanders. ==Regular season== The Boston Bruins led the league in total points with 110. The defending Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders went from first overall and finished tied for 6th overall. The high-scoring Edmonton Oilers tied for second overall. The Oilers set a new record, which they had just set the previous year, for most goals in a season with 424. They were led by Wayne Gretzky, who had 196 points. The Oilers also tied the Boston Bruins' 1971 record for most 100-point players in one season as Wayne Gretzky, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, and Mark Messier all had more than 100 points. ===Final standings=== Note: GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalties in minutes Note: Teams that qualified for the playoffs are highlighted in bold ====Prince of Wales Conference==== Adams Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Boston Bruins 80 50 20 10 110 327 228 1202 Montreal Canadiens 80 42 24 14 98 350 286 1116 Buffalo Sabres 80 38 29 13 89 318 285 1031 Quebec Nordiques 80 34 34 12 80 343 336 1648 Hartford Whalers 80 19 54 7 45 261 403 1392 Patrick Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Philadelphia Flyers 80 49 23 8 106 326 240 1337 New York Islanders 80 42 26 12 96 302 226 1266 Washington Capitals 80 39 25 16 94 306 283 1329 New York Rangers 80 35 35 10 80 306 287 1100 New Jersey Devils 80 17 49 14 48 230 338 1270 Pittsburgh Penguins 80 18 53 9 45 257 394 1859 ====Clarence Campbell Conference==== Norris Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Chicago Black Hawks 80 47 23 10 104 338 268 1185 Minnesota North Stars 80 40 24 16 96 321 290 1520 Toronto Maple Leafs 80 28 40 12 68 293 330 1481 St. Louis Blues 80 25 40 15 65 285 316 1281 Detroit Red Wings 80 21 44 15 57 263 344 1064 Smythe Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Edmonton Oilers 80 47 21 12 106 424 315 1771 Calgary Flames 80 32 34 14 78 321 317 1146 Vancouver Canucks 80 30 35 15 75 303 309 1639 Winnipeg Jets 80 33 39 8 74 311 333 1089 Los Angeles Kings 80 27 41 12 66 308 365 1367 ===Scoring leaders=== Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points Player Team GP G A Pts PIM Wayne Gretzky Edmonton Oilers 80 71 125 196 59 Peter Stastny Quebec Nordiques 75 47 77 124 78 Denis Savard Chicago Black Hawks 78 35 86 121 99 Mike Bossy New York Islanders 79 60 58 118 20 Marcel Dionne Los Angeles Kings 80 56 51 107 22 Barry Pederson Boston Bruins 77 46 61 107 47 Mark Messier Edmonton Oilers 77 48 58 106 72 Michel Goulet Quebec Nordiques 80 57 48 105 51 Jari Kurri Edmonton Oilers 80 45 59 104 22 Glenn Anderson Edmonton Oilers 72 48 56 104 70 Kent Nilsson Calgary Flames 80 46 58 104 10 ==Stanley Cup playoffs== ===Playoff bracket=== ===Finals=== New York Islanders vs. Edmonton Oilers Date Visitors Score Home Score Notes May 10 New York 2 Edmonton 0 May 12 New York 6 Edmonton 3 May 14 Edmonton 1 New York 5 May 16 Edmonton 2 New York 4 New York wins the series 4–0. ==NHL awards== Prince of Wales Trophy: New York Islanders Clarence S.
