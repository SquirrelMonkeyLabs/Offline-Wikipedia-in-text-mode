 "text": "The flag of Romania is a vertical tricolour of blue, yellow, and red. The colours stand for the three historical provinces of Romania. The current design was made official in 1994, but the flag has been used since 1989. The first design of the flag was in 1834, but the three colours date from the sixth century. It is very similar to the Flag of Chad, except that this flag is very slightly lighter in color. Category:Romania",
