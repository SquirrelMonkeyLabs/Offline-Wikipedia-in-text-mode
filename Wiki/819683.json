 "text": "The Mexican burrowing tree frog or cross-banded tree frog (Smilisca) is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. They live in Mexico, southern Texas and Arizona, Central America, and northwestern South America. Scientists studying Hylidae recently decided that two species from Pternohyla were really Smilisca., 2005: Systematic Review of the Frog Family Hylidae, with Special Reference to Hylinae: Phylogenetic Analysis and Taxonomic Revision. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Num. 294, pp.1-240. The name \"smilisca\" is from the Ancient Greek for \"little knife.\" The Mexican burrowing tree frogs are called Smilisca because they have pointed frontoparietal processes. ==Species== Binomial name and author Common name S. baudinii Common Mexican tree frog S. cyanosticta Blue-spotted Mexican tree frog S. dentata Upland burrowing tree frog S. fodiens Lowland burrowing tree frog S. manisorum Masked tree frog S. phaeota New Granada cross-banded tree frog or masked tree frog S. puma Nicaragua cross-banded tree frog S. sila Panama cross-banded tree frog S. sordida Veragua cross-banded tree frog ==References== * .
