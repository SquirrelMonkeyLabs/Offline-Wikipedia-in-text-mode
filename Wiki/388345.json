 "text": "The Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major (\"Turkish\"), K. 219 is a work for solo violin and orchestra. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1775. He wrote five concertos for violin between April and December 1775. These were probably written for his own use as concertmaster of the Archbishop of Salzburg's orchestra. The five concertos are the only violin concertos he wrote. The concerto begins with a quick Allegro aperto movement which is followed by a slow Adagio second movement. The third and final movement is a rondo in minuet tempo. \"Turkish\" music was popular at the time this concerto was written. The rondo's wild, frenzied contrasting section gives the concerto its nickname. ==References== Category:Compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Mozart 5 Category:Compositions in A major",
