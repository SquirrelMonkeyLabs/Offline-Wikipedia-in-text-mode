 "text": "Fuck is a common English language swear word. It can be used either as an expression or to mean the act of sex. However, the word fucking is used as an intensifier before a word (e.g. \"I fucking hate this game\"). It is commonly used to express anger and frustration (e.g. when something is not going in favor of someone), however it is a word that is offensive to most people. ==Related pages== *Bitch *Bullshit *Cunt *Shit Category:English profanity",
