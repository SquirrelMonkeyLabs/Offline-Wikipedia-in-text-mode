 "text": "The ichthys or ichthus (/ˈɪkθəs/), from the Greek ikhthū́s (ἰχθύς, 1st century AD Koine Greek pronunciation: [ikʰˈtʰys], \"fish\") is a symbol consisting of two intersecting arcs, the ends of the right side stretching beyond the meeting point to look like a fish. ==In the Gospels== Fish are mentioned and given symbolic meaning several times in the Gospels. Several of Jesus' 12 Apostles were fishermen. He tells them that \"I will make you fishers of men\". (Mark 1: 16-18). Having been resurrected, Jesus was given grilled fish in Luke 24:41-43.
