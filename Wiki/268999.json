 "text": "Fruitadens is a genus of heterodontosaur dinosaur. It was a small ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to 75 cm (26 to 30 in) in length and 0.5 to 0.75 kg (1.1 to 1.7 lb) in weight. The name means \"Fruita tooth\", in reference to Fruita, Colorado, where its fossils were first found. Paleontologists have found partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals from rocks in the Morrison Formation in Colorado. == Characteristics == Fruitadens was an omnivore. The dinosaur's lower jaws had an enlarged canine-like tooth, opposite a gap in the upper jaw (a 'diastema'). Unlike Echinodon, there wasn't an enlarged tooth in the upper jaw. A small peg-like tooth was present in front of the canine-like tooth. Replacement teeth were present in the jaws, unlike most other heterodontosaurids. category:Heterodontosaurs",
