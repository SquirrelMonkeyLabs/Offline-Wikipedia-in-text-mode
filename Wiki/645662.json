Aaron Alexandre trained as a rabbi. He arrived in France in 1793.Saint-Amant [Pierre-Charles Fournier de], Nécrologie: A. Alexandre, La Régence, 1st ser., 3, no. 1 (January 1851): 3–13. He taught German and was a mechanical inventor. He later became a full-time chess player. He wrote a book of all the known chess openings, the Encyclopédie des échecs (Encyclopedia of Chess, Paris, 1837). In the book, he used the algebraic notation and the castling symbols 0–0 and 0–0–0. His next book was about the endgame and a collection of about 2000 chess problems, which he published in 1846 as Collection des plus beaux Problèmes d'Echecs, Paris. English and German translations: Beauties of Chess, London, and Praktische Sammlung bester Schachspiel-Probleme, Leipzig.Knight's Tour Notes, Part Cb: Chronology 1800 – 1899.
