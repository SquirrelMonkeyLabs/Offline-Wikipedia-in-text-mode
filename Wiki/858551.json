 "text": "The Datschiburger Kickers are a charity association football team from Augsburg with a changing line-up. The team featured well-known athletes, local Augsburg celebrities and show stars. The team was founded in 1965 by Max Gutmann, an Augsburg entrepreneur and promoter of sports and science, and sports journalist Horst Eckert. The impetus came from a charity match between FC Schmiere and Augsburg's celebrity team on July 17, 1965, which 30,000 people came to watch at Rosenaustadion. The Datschiburger Kickers are still active today. More than 300 games have been played since 1965 and over 1.5 million Euros have been raised for social causes. Since the club was founded in 1965, the Kickers remained undefeated for almost 45 years. On July 23, 2010, the Datschiburg Kickers' winning streak ended in a match against the Sport Press team, which they lost 4–3. The team's name is derived from a nickname for Augsburg citizens, the Datschiburgers. This in turn is based on the Zwetschgendatschi, a yeast cake invented in Augsburg. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Datschiburger Kickers played in Augsburg's Rosenaustadion in front of up to 20,000 spectators. The most famous team members were athletes such as Helmut Schön, Günter Netzer, Sepp Herberger, Helmut Haller, Uwe Seeler, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Fritz Walter, Uli Biesinger and Max Schmeling. However, celebrities such as Gunter Sachs, Gert Fröbe and Uschi Glas also competed. == References == All references are in German. * Horst Eckert (Text), Günter Swoboda (Gestaltung): 40 Jahre Datschiburger Kickers e.V. 1965–2005.
