 "text": "Tropical Storm Arlene was the first named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Arlene was a large storm that formed early in the year. It had maximum wind speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h). It also caused one death and created $11.8 million (2005 USD) in damage. The storm formed near Honduras on June 8 and moved north. It came close to western Cuba on June 10 before entering the Gulf of Mexico. Arlene strengthened just below hurricane strength before making landfall on western Florida. The storm quickly weakened while moving inland, and later became an extratropical remnant on June 13. ==Naming== When Tropical Storm Arlene formed on June 8, it was the ninth time that the name has been used to name a storm in the Atlantic. This meant Arlene kept its position as the most commonly used name for Atlantic storms. But because the storm did not cause any major damages, its name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the 2011 season. ==Related pages== * 2005 Atlantic hurricane season * List of hurricanes in Florida ==Other websites== * NHC's archive on Tropical Storm Arlene. * The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center's (HPC) archive on Tropical Storm Arlene. * NHC's Tropical Cyclone Report on Tropical Storm Arlene Category:2005 in Alabama Category:2005 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Atlantic tropical storms Category:Hurricanes in the United States Category:2005 in Cuba Category:2005 in Florida Category:June 2005 events Category:Hurricanes in Mississippi",
