After she died, anti-war activist Emily Hobhouse used her death as a example of the sufferings of the Boers in the concentration camps. Hobhouse visited Lizzie in the concentration camp and described that she was a \"weak and frail child in desperate need of good care.\" Hobhouse also took a photograph of Lizzie during her visit. Initially, Hobhouse's reporters refused to show the photograph to the world. == References == Category:1894 births Category:1901 deaths Category:Afrikaner people",
