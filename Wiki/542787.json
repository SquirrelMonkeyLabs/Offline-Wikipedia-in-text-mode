 "text": "Metal spinning is a process where a piece of sheet metal is rotated on a machine (often a lathe) to produce an object.Henry Ericsson Theis, Handbook of Metalforming Processes (New York; Basel: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1999), p. 407 The object usually has the qualities of being round, hollow and symmetrical. Metal spinning dates back thousands of years to Ancient Egypt. It is closely related to the potter's wheel. == Process == The process begins with a flat piece of metal or a metal cylinder. It is cut to a specific size based on the size of the finished part. A form is used to create the internal shape of the spun metal part. The form is often made of aluminum or hardened steel. Metal spinning used to be used for creating prototypes and where only a few parts needed to be made. With the introduction of automatic lathes, metal spinning can be used to create a larger number of parts inexpensively. == References == == Other websites == * Metal Spinning a Bowl on a Lathe Category:Metalworking",
