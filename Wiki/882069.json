 "text": "International non-government organisation Human Rights Watch identified in its Annual Report for 2020 that discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities remains a significant human rights issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian constitution prohibits ethnic minorities such as the Jewish people and the Roma people, which are the two largest minority groups in the country, from running for presidency. == LGBT rights == Same-sexual activity is legal in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Same sex marriage and relationships are not legally recognised under Bosnian law. Transgender persons are allowed to change their legal gender. In the United Nations Human Rights Council's 2019 report on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture expressed concern at the lack of investigation by authorities of hate crimes committed towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Homophobia and violence and hate crimes against members of the LGBT community is widespread in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 2008, seven civilians and a police officer were injured by anti-LGBT protestors at the Queer Festival Sarajevo. The organisers of the festival received anonymous death threats leading up to the festival. Six people were hospitalised with head injuries and one of the attackers was detained by police. In September 2019 Bosnia's first LGBT pride parade was held in Sarajevo, the country's capital city. One thousand police officers were present to protect the protestors from violence and hate crimes. Counter-protests were held in Sarajevo by anti-LGBT groups at the same time as the Pride parade. == References == Bosnia Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina",
