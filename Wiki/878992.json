 "text": "The Whanganui River is a major river in the North Island of New Zealand. It is long and is the third-longest river in New Zealand. It has special status owing to its importance to the region's Māori people. In March 2017 it became the world's first river to be given its own legal identity, with the right of legal person. The river source is on the north-western side of Mount Tongariro. The river flows to the north-west before turning south at Taumarunui. It reaches the seat at Whanganui. == References == Category:Rivers of New Zealand Category:Manawatū-Whanganui",
