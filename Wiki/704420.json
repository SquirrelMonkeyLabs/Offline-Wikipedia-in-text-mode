 "text": "Bennett's tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus bennettianus) is a large tree-kangaroo. Males can weigh from 11.5 kg up to almost 14 kg (25 to 31 lbs), and female about 8 to 10.6 kg (17.6 to 23 lbs). They are very agile and are able to leap 9 metres (30 ft) down to another branch. They have been known to drop as far as 18 metres (59 ft) to the ground without injury.Cronin (2000). ==Habitat== This very elusive (cryptic) tree-kangaroo is found in both mountain and lowland tropical rain forests south of Cooktown, Queensland to just north of the Daintree River. It is occasionally found in sclerophyll woodlands. It lives on the leaves of rainforest trees, notably Schefflera actinophylla (the umbrella tree), vines, ferns and various wild fruits.Martin (2005). ==Diet== The Bennett's tree-kangaroo is a herbivore. It eats leaves from 33 different plant species. Now that it is rarely hunted by Aborigines, its main predators are pythons and the dingo. It is thought to be the closest tree-kangaroo to the ancestral form.Martin et al 1996, pp. 94â€“95. == Physical description == Like other tree-kangaroos it has longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs than terrestrial kangaroos and a long bushy tail. It is mostly dark brown above and lighter fawn on chin, throat and lower abdomen. The forehead and muzzle are greyish. The feet and hands are black. The tail has a black patch at the base and a light patch on the upper part. The ears are short and rounded. == References == Category:Macropods",
