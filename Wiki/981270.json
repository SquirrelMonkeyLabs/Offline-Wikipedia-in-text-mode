 "text": "King Animal is the sixth and final studio album by American rock band Soundgarden, released on November 12, 2012 by Seven Four Entertainment and Republic Records. Produced by both the band and Adam Kasper, the album is the band's first in sixteen years, and the first not to be released on A&M; Records since 1988's Ultramega OK. ==Overview== Soundgarden reformed in 2010 after a 13-year hiatus. Following the success of the band's Telephantasm compilation release that year, Soundgarden had been working on a new album with an undefined release date. The band went on an extended world tour between the release of Telephantasm and the summer of 2012 before word broke that a new Soundgarden album would be ready for a fall release in the United States. \"Been Away Too Long\" was the first single released from King Animal on September 27, 2012. On October 31, \"Non-State Actor\" was released through Soundgarden's official YouTube channel. The son'gs video features an American flag waving back and forth with the King Animal logo replacing the stars. The week before its release, the album was streamed in its entirety for free on iTunes. ==References== Category:2012 albums Category:Soundgarden albums Category:A&M; Records albums",
