 "text": "The paramilitary forces of Pakistan consist of various organizations constitutionally charged to safeguard Pakistan's national interests. They protect from threats that could come from within the country to important areas or safeguard the entry points into the country such as the borders. They also protect citizens from threats that could come from inside the country. These threats started in 1971. They are currently made up from more than 300,000 soldiers. Some divisions of the force are now incorporated under other organizations. For example, the Northern Light Infantry was a paramilitary force until 1999, when it became part of the Pakistan Army.
