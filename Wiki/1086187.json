 "text": "The Malayan slender tree frog or Malayan whipping frog (Polypedates mutus) is a frog. It lives in Thailand and Malaysia. People have seen it between 61 and 206 meters above sea level. Scientists are not sure how this frog lives, but they have seen it in grass that grows close together near ponds that dry up for part of the year. They also saw the frogs on plants over the water. The scientists think the female frog lays eggs on these plants, and the tadpoles fall into the water. The adult frog's skin is not grown into its skull. The adult male frog makes four different sounds. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people cutting down its forests to grow palm oil plants may harm it. People would sometimes sell this frog as pets or for people to eat. But because scientists used to think this was the same frog as Polypedates leucomystax, they are not sure whether the frogs sold were P. leucomystax or P. discantus. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
