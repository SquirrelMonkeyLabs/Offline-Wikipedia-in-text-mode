It is about 5 nautical miles (5.8 miles or 9.3 km) northwest of Aberdeen city centre. 2.76 million passengers used Aberdeen Airport in 2010, a reduction of 7.4% from 2009. It is the 15th busiest airport in the UK. The airport was the second busiest airport in Scotland, and sixth busiest in the United Kingdom by number of flights in 2010. The airport is owned and operated by BAA, which is a Spanish company. It operates six British airports, including Heathrow Airport. Aberdeen Airport is a base for BMI Regional (part of BMI) and Eastern Airways. The Airport is also the main heliport for the Scottish offshore oil industry. The airport has one main passenger terminal, serving scheduled and charter holiday flights as well as some international flights with airlines such as, Air Baltic and KLM. There are three terminals for North Sea helicopter operations, used by Bristow Helicopters, CHC-Scotia, and Bond Offshore Helicopters. There is also a small terminal next to the main passenger terminal, Broomfield House, used for oil company charter flights to Scatsta in Shetland, operated by Eastern Airways. ==Heliport== Aberdeen Airport has the world's largest commercial heliport which has more than 400,000 passengers each year. With the newer aircraft, helicopters can reach the northern most platforms on both the East and west of Shetland areas. However, helicopters often use Wick, Kirkwall, Scatsa and Sumburgh for refuelling stops. ==References== Category:Airports in Scotland Category:Buildings and structures in Aberdeen",
