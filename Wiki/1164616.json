 "text": "Nikolas Cruz (born September 24, 1998) is the perpetrator of the Parkland high school shooting on February 14, 2018. He killed 17 people and injured 17 others before being arrested. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2022. Cruz qualified for special education assistance in addition to an IEP because of his behavioral problems, which date back to preschool. Cruz was \"well-known to school and mental health authorities and was entrenched in the process for getting students help rather than referring them to law enforcement,\" claimed The Washington Post. Cruz was given an oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis by Stephen E. Moskowitz. In an attempt to address these issues, he completed six school transfers in three years. In 2014, he was moved to a school for kids with learning or mental disorders. He was alleged to have threatened other pupils. Cruz attended Stoneman Douglas High School again two years later, but he was expelled for disciplinary reasons in 2017. == References == Category:American murderers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:1998 births Category:Living people",
