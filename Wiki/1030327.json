 "text": "The heritability of autism is how much of people getting autism is because of their genes. It is also the way that the genes create autism. Autism is mostly genetic, and it has a heritability of 80% to 90%. Heritability is how much genes can explain who gets autism and who doesn't. The environment can still be very important even with a large heritability. Heritability is estimated by studying twins. Since both twins have autism most of the time, it is more genetic. It is caused by many different genes working together, not just one. ==References== Category:Autism",
