Originally built in the mid-19th century as a royal palace and Moorish bathhouse for King William I, the castle later developed into a public zoo and botanical garden. Today, it covers approximately 30 hectares and is home to more than 11,000 animals from nearly 1,200 species. This makes it one of the most species-rich zoos in Germany. The zoo is renowned for its commitment to species conservation and breeding, especially endangered species such as gorillas, okapis and rhinos. Wilhelma Zoo combines zoological exhibitions with a rich botanical collection, which includes a historic greenhouse, subtropical plants and beautifully landscaped gardens. Visitors can experience a rich mix of architecture, nature and wildlife in the same place.
