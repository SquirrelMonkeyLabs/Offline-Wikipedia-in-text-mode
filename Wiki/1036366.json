 "text": "Healthcare in Australia is partly public and partly private. Most of the cost is met by the Australian Medicare system, which is a national single-payer funding model. The state and territory governments run public hospitals where people can get care free of charge. Primary health services, such as GP clinics, are mostly privately owned but attract Medicare pays part of the cost. Australian citizens, people who live in Australia, and some visitors and visa holders can get health services under the Medicare system. People can get health insurance to cover services offered in the private sector. The government pays about 25% of the cost. Private insurers have to charge people the same without taking into account any existing or previous conditions. Doctors are paid for seeing and treating people, and people can choose where they are treated. The federal Minister for Health sets national health policy. State and territory governments regulate and administer doctors, public hospitals and ambulance services. One third of hospital places are run privately. In 2017–18, total health spending was $185.4 billion, about $7,485 per person. Most of the money went on hospitals (40%) and primary health care (34%). Health spending was about 10% of overall economic activity. In 2020–21 it was $220.9 billion, 7.1% more than in 2019–20. 70% was paid by the government. Health spending as a proportion of GDP was 11th highest of OECD countries in 2019. In 2023, 81% of Australians said their healthcare system was ‘good’ or ‘very good’. ==References== Category:Australia Aus",
