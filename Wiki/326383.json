 "text": "John Harbaugh (born 9/23/1962 in Toledo, Ohio, USA) is the head coach for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. Since taking over the position from Brian Billick in 2008, Harbaugh has gotten the Ravens to the playoffs in each season, and is the only NFL head coach to do so. Harbaugh was previously the special teams coordinator and secondary coach of the Philadelphia Eagles for nine seasons. He is part of the famous Harbaugh coaching tree, that includes Father Jack Harbaugh and younger brother Jim Harbaugh. ==Reputation== Harbaugh has been respected as a great coach. As previously mentioned, Harbaugh is the only head coach in NFL history to take his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons. Harbaugh has also been successful on most challenge attempts. However, Harbaugh has sometimes been criticized for keeping unpopular offensive coordinator Cam Cameron, among some other things. But in 2013 he led the Baltimore Ravens to the Super Bowl. ==References== *Jim Harbaugh: Ravens will take to new coach-Baltimore Sun == Other websites == *Baltimore Ravens bio Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Ohio Category:National Football League coaches",
