In Bhutanese culture, the Druk is often associated with thunder and lightning, and is considered to be a powerful and benevolent creature. According to legend, the Druk was the emblem of the founder of Bhutan, the Tibetan saint and ruler, Ngawang Namgyal. The Druk on the Bhutanese flag is depicted holding jewels that represent the wealth and prosperity of the country. Its white color represents purity and loyalty, while the snarling mouth symbolizes the strength and courage of the Bhutanese people. The overall design of the flag, which features a yellow and orange background, is said to represent the colors of Buddhism and the country's position between India and China. Overall, the Druk is an important symbol of Bhutanese identity and cultural heritage, and is deeply ingrained in the country's history and mythology.
