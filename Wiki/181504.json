 "text": "Homotopies are studied in a branch of mathematics known as Algebraic Topology. A homotopy is a deformation (change of form) of one thing into another without cutting it. For example, if we imagine a stretchy object, then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are \"homotopy equivalent\". One famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a coffee cup and a donut. To a topologist, these two shapes are the same. The first example of a homotopy that a topology student is introduced to is a homotopy between functions. A homotopy between two functions f and g provides a collection of functions that start at f and eventually become g. What this means is that this homotopy takes a parameter and gives a function, and there is a possible parameter that gives f and one that gives g. Typically, we choose the interval [0, 1] because this has a starting and ending point, and numbers are allowed to vary smoothly within [0, 1]. To output a function, this means that the homotopy takes a second parameter, which is the argument of the output function. That is, if f takes a number in the interval and outputs pairs of real numbers, the homotopy takes a number in the interval as the parameter and another number in the interval for f. The homotopy then outputs the interpolated function evaluated at the given pair. That is, if H is a homotopy from f to g, then we know H: [0,1]\\times [0, 1]\\to\\mathbb{R}^2where H(p, 0)=f(p)and H(p, 1)=g(p). Category:Topology",
