 "text": "The 2010 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes were an armed conflict that took place on February 18 on the line of contact dividing Azerbaijani and the Karabakh Armenian military forces. Azerbaijan blamed the Armenian forces of shooting at the Azerbaijani positions near Tap Qaraqoyunlu, Q覺z覺loba, Qapanl覺, Yusifcanl覺 and Cavahirli villages. As a result, three Azerbaijani soldiers were killed and one wounded. The attack became the second deadliest peace violation since 1994, after the 2008 Mardakert clashes. == Incidents == The incidents included two regions in Nagorno-Karabakh (Tartar Rayon, Agdam Rayon) and one region out of it (Goranboy Rayon). Azerbaijani sources claim that on 13:00 local time the Karabakh Armenian military fired from Talysh towards the Azerbaijani positions in Tap Qaraqoyunlu. Accordingly, at 15:00 Armenian troops supposedly fired from Agdam Rayon, killing one Azeri soldier. == Casualties == Following the incidents the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry announced the names of those killed: Private Sahil Mammadov (born 10 April 1991, called up by Shaki Commissariat in April, 2009), Corporal Royal Farajov (born 8 March 1991, called up in April, 2009), Private Davud Rustamov (born 22 July 1991, called up in October, 2009). Private Elvin Adigozalov (born 10 December 1990, called up in January, 2009) was injured. Although the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense estimated Armenian casualties to be equal, Armenian military spokesman Senor Hasratian denied that the Armenian side had encountered any casualties. == Notes == Category:2010 in Asia Category:Conflicts Category:Azerbaijan Category:February 2010 events",
