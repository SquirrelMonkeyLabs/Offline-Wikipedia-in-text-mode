 "text": "A coordinate system is a system of numbers used to uniquely determine the position of a point. For two-dimensional systems, the numbers (scalars) are in ordered pairs. More dimensions call for more numbers. For example, (3) is one- dimensional, (1, 4) is two-dimensional, (1, 5, 9) is three-dimensional, (2, 6, 5, 3) is four-dimensional, and (5, 8, 9, 7, 9) is five-dimensional. ==Related pages== * Analytic geometry * Cartesian coordinate system * Celestial coordinate system * Polar coordinate system * Spherical coordinate system Category:Coordinate systems",
