 "text": "\"The Contest\" is the 51st episode of the television show Seinfeld. It was first broadcast on NBC on November 18, 1992. The episode is about the show's main characters starting a contest on how long they can go without masturbating. NBC thought that masturbation was not a good topic to show on television. The word \"masturbation\" is not said in the episode. The phrase \"master of my domain\" (meaning someone who is trying not to masturbate) has been made as a catchphrase in popular culture. Larry David won a Primetime Emmy Award (for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series) for writing the episode. TV Guide put the episode as the 1st in their list of Greatest Episode of All-Time.\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\" TV Guide; June 15, 2009; Pages 34-49 == References == == Other websites == * Category:Seinfeld Category:1992 television episodes",
