 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Jura department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. The arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Jura department are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 391 Dole Dole 83,701 1,171.2 191 392 Lons-le-Saunier Lons- le-Saunier 126,071 2,825.4 258 393 Saint-Claude Saint-Claude 50,909 1,002.6 60 ==History== Since its creation, the Jura department has had few changes: * 1790 : six districts: Dole, Salins, Poligny, Lons-le-Saunier, Orgelet, Saint- Claude. * 1800 : the six districts were changed into four arrondissements: Lons-le-Saunier, Dole, Poligny and Saint-Claude. * 1926 : the arrondissement of Poligny was eliminated. ==Related pages== * List of arrondissements of France == References == Jura",
