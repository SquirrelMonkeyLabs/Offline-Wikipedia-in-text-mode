 "text": "The President of the Republic of Hungary (, államelnök, or államfő) is the head of state of Hungary. The office has a largely ceremonial (figurehead) role. The president may also veto legislation or send legislation to the Constitutional Court for review. Most other executive powers, such as selecting Government ministers and leading legislative initiatives, are given in the office of the Prime Minister instead. The current President of the Republic is Tamás Sulyok, who took office on 5 March 2024. ==List of presidents (since 1989)== Parties Picture Name (Birth–Death) Term of Office Term of Office Political Party Position(s) Term (Election) — Mátyás Szűrös (born 1933) 23 October 1989 2 May 1990 MSZP Provisional President of the Republic — — Árpád Göncz (1922–2015) 2 May 1990 3 August 1990 SZDSZ Acting President of the Republic — 1 4 August 1990 4 August 1995 President of the Republic 1 (1990) 4 August 1995 4 August 2000 2 (1995) 2 Ferenc Mádl (1931–2011) 4 August 2000 5 August 2005 Independent 3 (2000) 3 László Sólyom (born 1942) 5 August 2005 6 August 2010 4 (2005) 4 Pál Schmitt (born 1942) 6 August 2010 2 April 2012 (resigned) Fidesz 5 (2010) — László Kövér (born 1959) 2 April 2012 10 May 2012 Acting President of the Republic — 5 János Áder (born 1959) 10 May 2012 8 May 2017 President of the Republic 6 (2012) 8 May 2017 10 May 2022 7 (2017) 6 Katalin Novák (born 1977) 10 May 2022 26 February 2024 President of the Republic 8 (2022) — László Kövér (born 1959) 26 February 2024 5 March 2024 Acting President of the Republic — 7 80px Tamás Sulyok 5 March 2024 Incumbent Independent President of the Republic 9 == Living former presidents == There are four living former Hungarian presidents: File:Szűrös Mátyás (Heti Válasz).JPG|Mátyás Szűrös (1989–1990) File:László Sólyom.jpg|László Sólyom (2005–2010) File:SchmittPal-2011-01.jpg|Pál Schmitt (2010–2012) File:Ader Janos.jpg|János Áder (2012–2022) File:Katalin Novák, 2023 (cropped).jpg|Katalin Novák (2022–2024) ==Other websites== * Official Website *",
