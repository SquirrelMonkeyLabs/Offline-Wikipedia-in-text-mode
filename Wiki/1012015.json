 "text": "The Ottoman Empire used to have a different anthem for each ruler. The first Sultan that appeared to have a personal anthem was Mahmud II. He started reforms which included the modernization of Ottoman imperial and military bands. This process went to Italian-born composer Giuseppe Donizetti, who was also the composer of first Ottoman Imperial anthem – Mahmudiye Marşı, and second – Mecidyie Marşi. Mehmed VI, the last Ottoman sultan didin't choose a special march composed for him but rather chose to use the “Mahmudiye”. == List of ottoman Imperial anthems == * Mahmudiye Marşı, March of Mahmud – for Mahmud II (1829–1839, 1918–1922), by Giuseppe Donizetti * Mecidiye Marşı, March of Mecid – for Abdulmejid I (1839–1861), by Giuseppe Donizetti * Aziziye Marşı, March of Aziz – for Abdülaziz (1861–1876), by Callisto Guatelli * Hamidiye Marşı, March of Hamid – for Abdul Hamid II (1876–1909), by Necip Paşa * Reşadiye Marşı, March of Reşad – for Mehmed V (1909–1918), by Italo Selvelli == Lyrics == Only the Hamidiye Marşı and Reşadiye Marşı used to have lyrics, the first three anthems were completly instrumental.
