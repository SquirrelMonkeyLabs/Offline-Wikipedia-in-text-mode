 "text": "A tram stop is a place where a tram stops so passengers can get on or get off. Tram stops are similar to bus stops, but because trams move on rails, they may include railway platforms. Platforms are needed if the tram system uses stepless entries for accessibility. However, trams may also stop at mid-street pavements when they run along streets. A tram stop may also be called a tram station or streetcar stop. ==Related pages== * Bus stop * Train/railway station ==Other websites== Category:Tram transport",
