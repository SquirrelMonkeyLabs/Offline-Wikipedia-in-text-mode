 "text": "Nyctaginaceae, the four o'clock family, has about 33 genera and 290 species of flowering plants. It grows in tropical and subtropical regions, with a few representatives in temperate regions. It includes plants like the Bougainvillea and the four o'clock. Most of the species are vines. The family has a unique fruit type, called an \"anthocarp\".An anthocarp is an accessory fruit: some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some exterior tissue. Many genera have extremely large (>100 Âµm) pollen grains. A curious aspect of M. jalapa, the four o'clock, is that flowers with different colours grow simultaneously on the same plant. == Notes == Category:Caryophyllales Category:Plant families",
