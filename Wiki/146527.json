 "text": "101 Dalmatians is a movie made by The Walt Disney Company in 1996. It is a remake of the 1961 animated movie 101 Dalmatians (which was based on Dodie Smith's 1956 novel The 00 and 1 Dalmatians). The movie's main actor is Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil. Unlike in the earlier versions of the story, the dalmatians are played by real dalmatian actors, and none of the dalmatians talk. A sequel, 102 Dalmatians, was made in 2000 and was released in November. This movie is called simply 101 in Japan, like its sequel, which is called 102. == Cast == * Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil * Jeff Daniels as Roger Dearly * Joely Richardson as Anita Campbell-Green-Dearly * Joan Plowright as Nanny * Hugh Laurie as Jasper * Mark Williams as Horace * John Shrapnel as Skinner * Tom Juddy as Pongo (speaking) * Julie Moorthie as Perdita (speaking) * Billy Neltane as Lucky * Michael Bantel as Kipper * Craig DeSeve as Sergeant Tibbs * Giselle Neith as Cow * Henry Banvali as Pig * Phil LaHerr as The Captain * Tim Jarry and Bob Maltz as 2 Goat * Mike Walker as Raccoon * J.
