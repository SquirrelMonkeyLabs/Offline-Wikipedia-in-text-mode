It lives in the southeastern United States, from Illinois south to Florida and west to Texas. Human beings have also brought it to Puerto Rico. ==Appearance== This frog has a pointed snout. It has two rows of vomerine teeth. Some fo these frogs have no stripes, but most have one yellow and white stripe down each side of the body. These frogs have yellow spots. ==Home== This frog lives in swamps, marshes, sloughs, and the edges of lakes where grass grows in the water. ==Threats== This frog is not endangered but there are fewer of them than there were because human beings change the places where they live. Human beings cut down trees for logging and build artificial lakes and ponds. Also, human beings brought the Cuban tree frog to the places where the American green tree frog lives. ==Salt== Most amphibians die if they try to swim in seawater, but the American Green tree frog can live in water that has some salt. Scientists have found that the frog uses the chemical glycerol to do this. They also only stay tadpoles for a short time. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
