 "text": "Wang Film Productions Co., Ltd. (also known as Hong Guang Animation (宏廣) and Cuckoos' Nest Studio) is a Taiwanese-American animation studio since 1978. == History == Wang Film/Cuckoos' Nest, the studio's original name, was founded by James C.Y. Wang (王中元)/Wang Zhongyuan, Hsu Chih-wei and Lu Kuang-chi started the studio in 1978 as an overseas facility for the U.S. animation outlet Hanna–Barbera. Hanna-Barbera sent Jerry Smith to help set up the company and eventually owned half the company. Many employees from Chunghwa Cartoon came to work at Cuckoos' Nest Studio along with employees from Ying Ren Cartoon and Shang Shang. Don Patterson was brought on board as a trainer. The company started with about 50 employees but soon had 300. In the company's first year, 17 episodes were produced for Hanna-Barbera. Quickly, they had contracts with Walt Disney, Warner Brothers, and Universal. With increased wages and foreign exchange rates, Cuckoos' was being priced out of the outsourcing market. Thus the CNS began restructuring. A Chinese subsidiary was opened in 1990 in Zhuhai, southern Guangdong province. In 1991, Cuckoos' Nest had to lay off 200 employees in Taipei. The company began computerization to reduced cost, while training some that would have been laid off to operate the computers. By 1993, the company had capacity to produce 200 half hour episodes each year. In 1993, a Shanghai unit, possibly a joint venture, was under consideration with Bangkok as an alternative. Also, internal developed and produced material was expected to start hitting the market in mid-1994. In early 1991, Hanna-Barbera sold its digital ink and paint software to the company which was developed by Marc Levoy. The company is also famous for their work on the overseas production for Nelvana's Care Bears franchise, Film Roman's Garfield and Friends and Bobby's World, Klasky Csupo's Rugrats pilot and first season, Disney's DuckTales and Stretch Films' Courage the Cowardly Dog. They also helped produce effects for the 1982 film Tron and some Peanuts television specials, production ink & paint matting, and animation assistance. == Filmography == === TV series === ==== Outsourced from Disney Television Animation ==== * 101 Dalmatians: The Series (1997–1998) * The 7D (Season 2) * Aladdin (1994) - 14 half-hour episodes: Elemental, My Dear Jasmine, To Cure a Thief, My Fair Aladdin, Web of Fear, Seems Like Old Crimes: Part 1, Seems Like Old Crimes: Part 2, The Love Bug, The Vapor Chase, The Day the Bird Stood Still, Smells Like Trouble, Armored and Dangerous, Dune Quixote, The Prophet Motive and Sea No Evil. * American Dragon: Jake Long * Bonkers (1993–1994) * Brandy & Mr. Whiskers * Buzz Lightyear of Star Command * Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (1989–1990, Season 2 only) - 16 episodes: The Luck Stops Here, An Elephant Never Suspects, Fake Me to Your Leader, Last Train to Cashville, The Case of the Cola Cult, Throw Mummy from the Train, A Wolf in Cheap Clothing, Robocat, Does Pavlov Ring a Bell, Seer No Evil, Chocolate Chips, The Last Leprechaun, Double 'O Chipmunk, Short Order Crooks and Out of Scale. * Darkwing Duck (1991) - 3 half-hour episodes: The Darkwing Squad, Inside Binkie's Brain and Slime Okay, You're Okay. * Dave the Barbarian * DuckTales (some 1987 and 1989–1990 episodes only) * The Emperor's New School (2006–2008) * Fillmore!
