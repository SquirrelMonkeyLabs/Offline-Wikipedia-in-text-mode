His songs often had ambiguous sexual content which he sung with a toothy grin and air of innocence His song When I'm Cleaning Windows was banned by the BBC in 1936. The director general John Reith said \"if the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, they'll have to be content to hear it in the cinemas, not over the nation's airwaves\". He later sang it before the King and Queen at the Royal Variety Performance. It was unbanned. During the Second World War he worked all over the world for the Entertainments National Service Association.

It was also considered rude and a BBC manager in 1946 said \"We have no record that 'With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock' is banned. We do however know, and so does Formby, that certain lines in the lyric must not be broadcast\". ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Actors from Greater Manchester Category:Actors from Lancashire Category:English singer- songwriters Category:Comedians from Lancashire Category:People from Wigan",
