 "text": "The WAGR J class were a total of 3 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1891 to 1924. The WAGR J class were built in 1891 by Kitson & Coy of Leeds, England to work the mail train from Fremantle to Beverley. Due to the small size of their fireboxes, they had Q class boilers fitted in 1907. In early 1924 all three locos were withdrawn and sold to State Saw Mills (SSM) who continued to operate them into the 1930s before they were scrapped.
