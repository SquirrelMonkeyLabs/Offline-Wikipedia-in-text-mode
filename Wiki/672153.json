 "text": "SAM Colombia Flight 501 was a SAM Colombia Boeing 727-46 that crashed on May 19, 1993, killing all 132 on board, including several Panamanian dentists on their way to a convention. The crew reported over the Abejorral NDB beacon at FL160, approaching Medellín. The flight was then cleared to descend to FL120. The 727 had actually not yet reached the beacon, and descended into mountainous terrain. The flight struck Mount Paramo Frontino at 12,300 feet. Thunderstorm activity in the area made ADF navigation more difficult and the Medellín VOR/DME had been attacked by terrorists and was unserviceable. == References == == Other websites == * ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 727-46 HK-2422X Medellín Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the 1990s Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in South America Category:20th century in Colombia Category:1990s in South America Category:1993 disasters",
