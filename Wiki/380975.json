 "text": "The George Inn is a public house in Southwark, London. It is on the east side of Borough High Street, close to London Bridge. It is the last galleried inn in London. It stands on a site where Shakespeare was said to have once acted in a similar galleried inn. The present inn was built in 1677. It was an important coaching post in the past. Charles Dickens speaks of the inn in Little Dorrit. The inn's long wooden exterior galleries are the only means of moving from one room to another on the first and second floors. A Victorian coffee room is downstairs. Upstairs, there is a large paneled dining room. The George Inn is owned by the National Trust. == References== * Fedden, Robin and Rosemary Joekes. 1973.
