The adult female frog is 64.9 mm long from nose to rear end. It is gray-green in color with yellow and black marks. The iris of the eye is pink and black in color. There are yellow and black spots on the belly and sides too. It has some fringed skin on the front and back toes. These frogs live in land near streams and rivers. The tadpoles live in cracks in the rocks underwater. The adult frogs move around at night. Scientists saw them on high tree branches not far from the water.
