In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger; \"I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I’m obsessed, and it’s a really fun thing that I’ve never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it’s... the only one on the record that sounds like that. It’s really different and a lot of my friends I’ve played it for really like it. I’m having a lot of fun with that one.\" Lyrically, Lavigne told Digital Spy; \"'Hello Kitty' was such an interesting topic and subject [...] It was really exciting for me. I didn't want it to sound like anything I'd done before. I wanted it to sound over the top so I ended up hiring a new producer to help me with it.\" She was later asked about the double meaning abut the song, to which she responded \"Obviously it's flirtatious and somewhat sexual, but it's genuinely about my love for Hello Kitty as well.\" Additonally, she said at MuchMusic \"It’s really fun [and] it’s about a slumber party and loving the kitty.\"MuchMusic interview. Entertainment Weekly's Nick Catucci exclaimed \"Hello Kitty,\" a dubstep track that seems to acknowledge its own tokenism by adopting a \"J-Pop American Funtime Now!\" sheem (and whose title may or may not enclose a double entendre that in any case I’d rather not entertain) [...]\" Craig Manning from AbsoultePunk said \"The biggest leap of faith is made on “Hello Kitty,” a trippy patchwork of EDM and pop that pays loving tribute to Lavigne's sizable Japanese following.\"Avril Lavigne review. Muumuse's Bradley Stern had discussed the song in a lengthy review and explained; \"Hello Kitty\" is an offbeat EDM-infused stomper. Conjuring Gwen Stefani's lively Japanese-minded Love. Angel. Music. Baby (plus a Fashionable Dubstep Breakdown for good measure!), Avril lets her love affair for the beloved Japanese mascot go wild across pulsing beats and sputtering electronica as she shouts outs hilarious commands: \"Like a fat kid on a pack of smarties / Someone chuck a cupcake at me!\" He also referred Lavigne's nature towards the song as \"insane\".Muumuse review. == References == Category:Avril Lavigne songs Category:2013 songs",
