 "text": "Thomas Gerard Tancredo (born December 20, 1945), usually called Tom Tancredo, is an American politician from Colorado. From 1999 to 2009, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives. He represented the state's sixth district. He is a Republican. He is best known for his oppostion to illegal immigration. While George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan were president, Tancredo worked in the United States Department of Education. From 1977 to 1981, he was a member of Colorado's state house. He ran for President of the United States in 2008. He also ran for Governor of Colorado in 2010. In the Colorado governor election, he ran as a member of the Constitution Party. He got second place with 36 percent of the vote. This is the best election result ever won by the Constitution Party. The winner of that election was Democrat John Hickenlooper. He won 51 percent of the vote. The Republican candidate, Dan Maes, only won 11 percent. Tancredo's result made the Constitution party a \"major party\", or a large party, in Colorado. If a party is \"major\", they get to have their candidate placed near the top of the ballot. They didn't run a candidate in the next election, so they became a \"minor\", or small party in 2014. Tancredo tried to run for Governor again in 2014 and 2018 as a Republican, but did not win their nomination either time. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Politicians from Denver Category:United States representatives from Colorado Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
