The Heike were badly outnumbered and out manoeuvered. Antoku`s guardian was his grandmother,( lady Ni) When it became clear the Heike had lost the battle, the boy emperor`s grandmother resolved not to be caught by the enemy alive. \" Where are you to take me?\" asked the boy emperor. Blinded by tears, the child emperor recited a Buddah prayer, then prayed to the east, then to the west to say farewell to the Buddah. Lady Ni took him in her arms, and with the words: \" In the depths of the ocean is our capital.\" They jumped together into the sea and drowned. Then followed a frenzied mass suicide by the remaining Heike forces. Only 43 Heike survived, all women in waiting. They were reduced to selling flowers and other favours to the local fisher folk.
