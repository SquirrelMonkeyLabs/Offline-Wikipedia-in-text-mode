 "text": "Dominic McKenzie Cummings (born 25 November 1971) is a British political strategist. He served as Chief Adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson from July 2019 until 13 November 2020. He was also special adviser to Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education from 2010 to 2014. From 2015 to 2016, Cummings was director of the successful Vote Leave campaign. It was an organisation against the continued British membership of the European Union. The group took an active part in the 2016 referendum campaign for Brexit. Cummings was born in Durham. He is married to Mary Wakefield. The couple have one son. Sir John Laws, a Lord Justice of Appeal, was Cummings' uncle. In May 2020, many people wanted Cummings to quit because he visited his parent's farm in Durham. Durham is over from his home in London. At the time, he had symptoms of COVID-19, and rules in the UK during the pandemic said people who thought they had the virus should stay at home. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Cummings had done nothing wrong and had a reason to go against the rules, because he needed child care for his child. The Durham Constabulary started an investigation to see if Cummings had broken the law. ==Early life== Cummings was born in Durham on 25 November 1971. His father, Robert, now a farmer, had a varied career, primarily as an oil rig project manager for Laing, the construction firm. His mother, Morag, became a teacher and behavioural specialist after private schooling and university. Sir John Laws, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, was his maternal uncle. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:British politicians Category:People from County Durham",
