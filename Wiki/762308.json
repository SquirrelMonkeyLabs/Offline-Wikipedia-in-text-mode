It launched on 30 May 2020 at 19:22:45 UTC (3:22:45 PM EDT). It was heading to the International Space Station. It was originally scheduled for 27 May 2020 at 20:33:33 UTC (4:33:33 PM EDT), but was stopped 16 minutes before take-off due to Tropical Storm Bertha. Demo-2 is the first crewed orbital spaceflight launched from the United States since the final Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, in 2011, on which Douglas G. Hurley was the pilot. Hurley was commander on Crew Dragon Demo-2, joined by Robert L. Behnken as joint operations commander. Crew Dragon Demo-2 is also the first two-person orbital spaceflight launched from the United States since STS-4 in 1982. ==References== Category:May 2020 events",
