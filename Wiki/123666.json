Four of these are higher than .; They are K2, Gasherbrum I, Broad Peak, and Gasherbrum II. K2 is the world's second highest peak. The range is about long and it covers a tract about broad. Karakoram separates the State of Kashmir from China, and South- central Asian States. It also protects Kashmir from the extreme cold winds of Siberia. There are over 300 peaks with an elevation between and high. Karakoram is the most glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions. Glaciers cover about 28-50% of the mountains in the range. This is much higher than the Himalayan average of 8-12%. Some of the famous glaciers are the Siachen Glacier ( long) and Biafo Glacier (long). These are the second and third longest glaciers in the world, outside the polar region. Many hilly lakes and hot-water springs are also located in Karakoram. The valleys are sources to many rivers and streams which drain in the Indus River. The high Karakoram Pass connects Kashmir with the Central Asian states. It is considered to be a historical route. Shaksgam Pass, Aghil Pass, and Khunjerab Pass are also in this range of mountains. ==References== Category:Mountain ranges of Pakistan",
