 "text": "The United States deputy secretary of defense (DepSecDef) is the second- highest-ranking official in the Department of Defense (DoD). The position was established in 1947 with the National Security Act. The first person to hold this position is Stephen Early. The deputy secretary is the principal civilian deputy to the secretary of defense, and is appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The deputy secretary, by statute, is designated as the DoD chief management officer and must be a civilian, at least seven years removed from service as a commissioned officer on active- duty at the date of appointment.. == Duties == The deputy secretary of defense has full power and authority to act for the secretary of defense and to exercise the powers of the secretary of defense on any and all matters for which the secretary is authorized to act pursuant to statute or executive order. The deputy secretary is first in the line of succession to the secretary of defense. The basic role of the deputy secretary of defense is to oversee the day-to-day business and lead the internal management processes of the $500-billion-plus Department of Defense budget, that is as its chief operating officer. The deputy secretary, among the office's many responsibilities, chairs the Senior Level Review Group (SLRG), before 2005 known as Defense Resources Board (DRB), which provides department-wide budgetary allocation recommendations to the Secretary and the President. Traditionally, the deputy secretary has been the civilian official guiding the process of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The deputy secretary of defense chairs the Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC), which has oversight duties and provides recommendations with respect to changes in status of the Department's Special Access Programs, for either the deputy secretary defense or the secretary of defense to make. == List of deputy secretaries of defense == No. Image Name Term of office Serving under Secretaries of Defense Appointed by President Began Ended Time in office 1 Stephen Early August 10, 1949 September 30, 1950 Louis A.
