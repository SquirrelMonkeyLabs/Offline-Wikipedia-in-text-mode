 "text": "Play were a Swedish pop girl group. Faye Hamlin, Anna Sundstrand, Ana√Øs Lameche, and Rosie Munter formed Play's original lineup from the band's formation from 2000 until late 2003. After founding member Hamlin left the group, fifth member Janet Leon joined Play to fill Hamlin's position as lead singer. In 2005, the group officially announced an \"indefinite break\" and split up. At that time, Play had sold almost one million albums. Four years later, in 2009, the group reformed with a new lineup of three members consisting of Lameche, Hamlin, and the sixth and oldest member of Play, Sanne Karlsson. In February 2011, an official statement was made that Hamlin had once again left the group in 2010 and would be replaced by Emelie Norenberg. It was announced in May 2011 that the band had separated for the second time. Category:Swedish musical groups",
