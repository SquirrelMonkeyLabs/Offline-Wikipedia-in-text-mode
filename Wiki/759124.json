 "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). ==The beginning== The disease was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after a man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. , there have been over 134,000 confirmed cases, 118,000 recoveries and 9,000 deaths in the country. The Government of Canada said that around 11,000–22,000 deaths could happen over the course of the pandemic. ==Cases== Most of those cases are in Canada's most populous provinces, Ontario (19,598 cases, 1,540 deaths) and Quebec (36,150 cases, 2,725 deaths). Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada's provinces and territories. An additional 13 cases involve citizens from the Grand Princess cruise ship. Among the Canadians who contracted the virus was Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who tested positive for the virus on March 12 after which the family went into self-isolation. By March 28, she had recovered. ==Spread== Until March 2020, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a large number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5, and Toronto's chief health officer announced on March 16 that there is \"some evidence of community transmission\" (that the disease was spreading within the country). ==Closures== In mid March, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada's provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories made school and daycare shutdown, ended on gatherings, closed non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry, and mandatory self-isolation for travellers. Canada severely restricted its border access. == Related pages == *COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia ==References== Category:2020s in Canada Canada",
