 "text": "Neurodiversity is a word for differences in people's brains. It is a type of biodiversity (diversity in living creatures). Examples of neurodiverse conditions include autism, Tourette syndrome, ADHD, dyslexia and HSP. == Movement == The neurodiversity movement is an approach to mental disability in which some neurological conditions are variations of the human brain. The term was first used in the late 1990s as a challenge to the idea that neurological differences are disorders instead of features. The movement believes that these variations should be recognised as a social category along with gender, human race and sexual orientation. Some people claim that neurodiversity would not be good for individuals with severe disabilities, such as low-functioning autism. They state that the difficulties are far greater than any potential strengths. == Related pages == *Autism rights movement *Biodiversity == References == Category:Controversies Category:Neurology",
