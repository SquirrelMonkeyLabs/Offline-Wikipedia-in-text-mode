 "text": "The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1990, and lasted until November 30, 1990. However, storms can form outside these dates. For example, Tropical Depression One formed on May 25. This season was very active with two depressions, six tropical storms, seven hurricanes, and one major hurricane. At that time it was the most active hurricane season. This season was less deadly and damaging than other seasons, with only 116 deaths, and $150 million. The few deaths and little bit of damage were because most of the storms were relatively weak, and because most of the storms stayed at sea. ==Storms== *Tropical Depression One *Tropical Storm Arthur *Hurricane Bertha *Tropical Storm Cesar *Hurricane Diana *Tropical Storm Edouard *Tropical Storm Fran *Hurricane Gustav *Tropical Storm Hortense *Hurricane Isidore *Tropical Depression Eleven *Hurricane Josephine *Hurricane Klaus *Hurricane Lili *Tropical Storm Marco *Hurricane Nana ==Storm names== These are the names that were set aside for 1990.
