 "text": "\"La Llorona\" (lit. \"The weeping woman\") is a Mexican folk song. The song began in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Its origins are unknown, but composer Andres Henestrosa in about 1940 popularized the song and may have added to the existing verses. One popular interpretation of the song is of the singer feeling trapped by this woman (La Llorona) who has fell in love with him. If he even thinks about leaving her, she weeps. He tries everything in his power to leave her, but he is trapped by pity for the woman. Another interpretation is that someone who was so in love with Llorona climed the highest pine tree to see her, but because the pine tree was young and not solid enough, fell and lost their life. Thus proving that even in death, the admirer still loves La Llorona. \"Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona no dejaré de quererte.\" The song “La Llorona” is featured in the 2017 Disney-Pixar movie Coco; it is performed by Alanna Ubach (in the English version) and Angélica Vale (in the Spanish version) as Imelda Rivera. ==References== Category:Folklore Category:Mexican culture",
