The town of Rauma expanded outside Old Rauma only in the early 19th century. The oldest currently standing buildings were built in the 18th century, because two fires in 1640 and 1682 destroyed the town. Most buildings are currently inhabited and owned by private individuals. The two main streets and area around the town square are mainly in business use. == References == == Other websites == * * Old Rauma as a VRML model * Old Rauma information in English Category:World Heritage Sites in Europe Category:History of Finland",
