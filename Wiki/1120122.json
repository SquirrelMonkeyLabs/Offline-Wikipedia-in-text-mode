The series takes place on an alternate Earth in which humans are enslaved by \"Tripods\" - large three-legged walking machines piloted by unseen aliens called the \"Masters.\" The first three books follow an unenslaved young English boy who joins a resistance group to fight against and overthrow the Tripods' rule. The prequel, however, follows another English boy who witnesses the arrival of the very first Tripods. == Books == # The White Mountains # The City of Gold and Lead # The Pool of Fire # When the Tripods Came (prequel) Category:Science fiction books",
