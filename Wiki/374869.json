He learned the art of stained glass in the workshop of his brother in St Albans. A visit to the London Drawing Academy woke up his interest for painting. He won a scholarship when he was 18 years old and so he was able to study at the Royal Academy of Arts in London from 1892 to 1897. In between he went on a scholarship to Italy where he was impressed by the fresco's of the Renaissance. This trip shaped his taste for pageant scenes. On the Royal Academy he won several medals. He also returned there several times with expositions. Salisbury made many murals in buildings, especially in London. He also painted many religious works and illustrations of historical events. He was well known for his portraits, especially of famous people like five British prime ministers, five American presidents and several others like Benito Mussolini when he visited Italy in 1934.

Salisbury died on August 31, 1962, in Hampstead, London, when he was 87 years old. == Paintings of Salisbury == == Bibliography == *1944: Portrait and Pageant: The Art of Frank O.
