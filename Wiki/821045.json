 "text": "\"Toreirol Lambuba\" () is an ancient veritable account (puya) of toponyms and descriptions of nomenclature of the places, particularly located on the river banks. Beginning with the epic adventure of Yoimongba and Taothingmang, the two Meitei princes in the 3rd century AD and place names formed thereon, the work diverges to recount the background of other places historically associated with different communities or clan dynasties till the reign of Poirei Khunjaoba in the 17th century AD. ==Related pages== * Sakok Lamlen * Tutenglon ==Bibliography== * https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.465025/2015.465025.Toreirol- Lambuba#mode/1up * https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.465025 ==References== Category:Puya Category:Meitei literature Category:History of Manipur",
