 "text": "President-elect of Argentina is the title used for an incoming president of Argentina between the general election on Election Day in October and noon Eastern Standard Time on Inauguration Day, December 10. During this time, the elected nominee is not in office yet. If the current president has won re- election, they are not given the title of president-elect because he or she is already in office and not waiting to become president. If a new president is scheduled to enter, then the current-standing one is said to hold the office on a lame duck basis. ==Overview== Presidential elections in Argentina generally take place every four years. In accordance with the National Constitution, the president and vice president are elected for a period of four years through direct popular vote, using a second round system. In this system, if no formula obtains more than 45% of the positive votes, or more than 40% of the positive votes with a percentage difference of 10 points with respect to the second formula, a second round is held between the two most positive formulas voted. The winner automatically becomes the President-elect of the country. ==References== Category:Presidents of Argentina",
