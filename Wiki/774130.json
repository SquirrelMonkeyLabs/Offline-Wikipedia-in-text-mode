 "text": "The green big-eyed tree frog (Nyctimystes humeralis) is a large tree frog from New Guinea. Scientists saw it in many places in the mountains in the middle of the island, between 600 and 1500 meters above sea level (2000 and 5000 feet). They saw it in Indonesia and in Papua New Guinea. The male frog is about 100 mm long from nose to rear end. The male frog has two pads on each first finger, called nuptial pads. The green big-eyed tree frog is the only frog in the genus Nyctimystes that has spikes on its humerus bones, and only the male frog has them. This frog is bright green with some yellow on its legs and rear. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
