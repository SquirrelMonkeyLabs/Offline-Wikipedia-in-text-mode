The game is known for its strange and sometimes scary content, such as an alien who plays piano and a girl who sometimes turns into a monster when you turn off the light. The game is free, and the official English version was put on Steam. ==Gameplay== Madotsuki lives alone in a small apartment with a bed, an old game console, and a desk where she writes a diary of her dreams. The player controls Madotsuki and can move her using the arrow keys. If you make her go to sleep by interacting with the bed, she goes into a dream version of her room. From there, you can make her explore 12 different dream worlds by going through doors that are in a large, dark place north of her room. From these worlds, other dream worlds can be accessed. To beat the game, the player has to find all 24 \"effects\" that are hidden in Madotsuki's dreams. Effects cause a change to Madotsuki, like turning her into a witch or making her small. The player can drop them in the main dream area, where they turn into egg-like objects. When they wake up, there is a step- ladder on Madotsukiâ€™s balcony. Walking off it makes Madotsuki jump off the building to her likely death, ending the game. == Other websites == *Yume Nikki & KIKIYAMA's Official Website Category:2000s horror video games Category:2004 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Freeware games Category:Indie video games Category:RPG Maker games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about dreams Category:Video games about nightmares Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games",
