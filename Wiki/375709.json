 "text": "An electric bicycle, or e-bike, is a bicycle that uses electricity as its power. These bikes do not pollute the air. Usually, a cyclist can control how much the motor helps. For example, it can be 50% of the force needed. In some cases, it is possible to change a traditional bike to electric using a conversion kit. In the United Kingdom, a new electric bicycle costs between £599 and £2,500. The cost of charging a battery is very small compared with the cost of petrol for a car. Some governments will help with the cost of buying one. According to the World Bicycle Industry Association, in 2022 10% of bicycle sales in the world were e-bikes. In the United States, the federal government has set a limit of 750 watts and a top electric-powered speed of 20MPH. This is to have only the rules that apply to bicycles and no extra restrictions such as operator license, vehicle license, registration or insurance requirements. == History == Electric bicycles have been around for over a century. They have become more popular in recent years because of advancements in technology and increased interest in sustainable transportation. First models of electric bicycles appeared in late 19th century. The United States Patent office registered several e-bike patents between 1895 and 1899. Ogden Bolton patented battery-powered bicycle in 1895. Hosea W. Libbey patented a bicycle with double electric motor in 1897. John Schnepf patented an electric motor with roller wheel. ==References== Category:Electric vehicles Category:Cycling",
