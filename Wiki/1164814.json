 "text": "The QWERTY effect depicts how keyboard layouts influence human language, naming preferences and behavior. One of the effects shows positive vs. negative associations to words. Jasmin and Casasanto found words that use more right-hand letters were more likable than left-hand letters. This affects both real and nonsense words for multiple languages. This effect has been found to apply both when text is read and created. There is evidence to suggest the QWERTY layout is influencing the choice of children's names in the United States. A similar effect, named the Wubi effect is driven by autocomplete, Chinese input methods for computers (the Wubi method), and input suggestions from search engines based on current events. == References == Category:Computer keyboard",
