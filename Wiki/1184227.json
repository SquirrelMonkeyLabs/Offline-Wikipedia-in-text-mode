 "text": "Daimler AG, now known as the Mercedes-Benz Group AG, has a fascinating history that dates back to the very origins of the automobile. Here are some key milestones: Early Beginnings: The company traces its roots to Benz & Cie. (founded in 1883) and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) (founded in 1890). These two companies were pioneers in the automotive industry, with Carl Benz creating the world's first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine in 1886. Merger: In 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG merged to form Mercedes-Benz, marking the birth of one of the most iconic automotive brands. Expansion and Challenges: Over the decades, Daimler-Benz expanded its operations globally, navigating through challenges such as World War II and the post-war reconstruction period. DaimlerChrysler Era: In 1998, Daimler-Benz merged with the American automaker Chrysler Corporation to form DaimlerChrysler AG. However, this partnership ended in 2007 when Chrysler was sold off. Renaming and Restructuring: In 2022, Daimler AG was renamed Mercedes-Benz Group AG following the spin-off of its commercial vehicle segment into a separate entity, Daimler Truck AG.
