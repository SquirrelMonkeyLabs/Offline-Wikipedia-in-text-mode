 "text": "Lucifer (means Lightbringer) is another name for the Devil. This is because people interpret a passage in the Book of Isaiah of the Bible in a certain way. Lucifer is Latin. It is made of two parts, lux-lucis (light) and ferre (to bring). There are two mentions of Lucifer in the Latin Vulgate. is used to refer to the morning star, the planet Venus that appears at dawn: once in to translate the Greek word \"Φωσφόρος\" (Phosphoros), which has exactly the same literal meaning of \"Light-Bringer\" that \"Lucifer\" has in Latin; and once in to translate \"הילל\" (Hêlēl), which also means \"Morning Star\". ==Latin name for the Morning Star== Lucifer is the Latin nameThe word has taken the form \"Luceafăr\" in modern Romanian; and \"Luzbel\" in Spanish, \"Lusbel\" in Portuguese, may be a folk evolution of Latin lucĭfer (Luz in the Diccionario Crítico Etimológico Castellano e Hispánico, volume III, Joan Corominas, José A. Pascual, 1989, Editorial Gredos, ). for the \"Morning Star\", both in prose and poetry, as seen in works by Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC), Cicero (106-43 BC) and other early Latin writersLewis and Short Cicero wrote: :Stella Veneris, quae Φωσφόρος Graece, Latine dicitur Lucifer, cum antegreditur solem, cum subsequitur autem HesperosDe Natura Deorum 2, 20, 53 :The star of Venus, called Φωσφόρος in Greek and Lucifer in Latin when it precedes, Hesperos when it follows the sun. And Pliny the Elder: :sidus appellatum Veneris … ante matutinum exoriens Luciferi nomen accipit … contra ab occasu refulgens nuncupatur VesperNatural History 2, 36 :The star called Venus … when it rises in the morning is given the name Lucifer … but when it shines at sunset it is called Vesper Poets also used the word \"Lucifer\". Ovid has at least eleven mentions of the Morning Star in his poetry. Virgil wrote: :Luciferi primo cum sidere frigida rura :carpamus, dum mane novum, dum gramina canentGeorgics 3:324-325 :Let us hasten, when first the Morning Star appears, :To the cool pastures, while the day is new, while the grass is dewy And Statius: :et iam Mygdoniis elata cubilibus alto :impulerat caelo gelidas Aurora tenebras, :rorantes excussa comas multumque sequenti :sole rubens; illi roseus per nubila seras :aduertit flammas alienumque aethera tardo :Lucifer exit equo, donec pater igneus orbem :impleat atque ipsi radios uetet esse sororiThebaid (poem) 2, 134-150 :And now Aurora rising from her Mygdonian couch had driven the cold darkness on from high in the heavens, shaking out her dewy hair, her face blushing red at the pursuing sun – from him roseate Lucifer averts his fires lingering in the clouds and with reluctant horse leaves the heavens no longer his, until the blazing father make full his orb and forbid even his sister her beams ==Lucifer as Devil character of the Bible== Lucifer is the epitome of evil in the Christian religion. Lucifer is believed by some to be Satan's name when he was still an angel, but it is Latin for 'light bringer' and not originally in the Bible. The word Lucifer was also used in Latin to mean the \"morningstar\", the planet Venus, and this word was used in the Latin version of Isaiah 14, where the Hebrew version was speaking to a king of Babylonia. ==References== Category:Demons",
