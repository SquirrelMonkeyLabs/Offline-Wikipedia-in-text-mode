 "text": "The Roswell incident is a series of events and myths about a military balloon crash. It happens in 1947 near Roswell, New Mexico. That summer, there is a craze about flying discs, and many Americans report seeing flying saucers. A rancher near Roswell finds some metallic and rubber debris. He thinks it is a crashed flying saucer and reports it to the military. Roswell Army Air Field recovers the debris. The Army tells the local news that they found a \"flying disc.\" This makes worldwide news, but the Army quickly changes their statement. The Air Force hides the real reason for the crash. It is a balloon used for nuclear test detection, but General Roger Ramey says it is a weather balloon. Thirty years later, conspiracy theorists say the government is hiding the truth. They claim the Air Force is covering up a spaceship. ==References== ;Young readers * * ;Video * Department of Defense (1997) The Roswell Reports. Vol. 1.
