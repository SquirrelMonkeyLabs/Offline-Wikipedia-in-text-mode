 "text": "Lenore \"Lee\" Krasner (born Lena Krassner; October 27, 1908 â€“ June 19, 1984) was an American abstract expressionist painter. She also worked in other media such as mosaics and especially collage. Krasner was influenced by George Bridgman and Hans Hoffman. Krasner was important within abstraction. She connected early-20th-century art with the new ideas of postwar America. She is also one of the few female artists to have a retrospective show at the Museum of Modern Art. She also had a retrospective exhibit at the Barbican Arts Center, London. ==References== Category:American painters Category:People from Brooklyn",
