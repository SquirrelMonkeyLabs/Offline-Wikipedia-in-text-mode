 "text": "Curry (from Tamil kari) is the English word for any of a general variety of spiced dishes, best known in Indian, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Indonesian, Malaysian, Pakistani, Thai, and other South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines. Curry has also been adopted into many other cuisines. Curry first came from India. The idea of curry was later brought to the West by British colonialists in India from the 18th century. Dishes that are often called curries in Europe and America are rarely called curries in their native languages. Curry can also be found in the United Kingdom and Jamaica. It is usually eaten with Basmati rice or naan, a type of flat bread. A curry dish called Balti is said to have been originated in Birmingham, United Kingdom and has been dubbed Britainâ€™s de facto national dish. ==Related pages== *Masala == References == Category:Indian food Category:Pakistani food Category:Afghan food Category:Belizean food Category:Bangladeshi food Category:Bhutanese food Category:British food Category:Burmese food Category:Chinese food Category:Fijian food Category:Guyanese food Category:Indonesian food Category:Jamaican food Category:Japanese food Category:Korean food Category:Malaysian food Category:Maldivian food Category:Mauritian food Category:Nepalese food Category:Omani food Category:Filipino food Category:Saint Helena Category:Seychellois food Category:Somali food Category:South African food Category:Sri Lankan food Category:Thai food Category:Vietnamese food",
