 "text": "The yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) is a species of tuna found in pelagic waters of tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. Yellowfin is often marketed as ahi, from its name ʻahi although the name ʻahi in Hawaiian also refers to the closely related bigeye tuna. Although the species name albacares might suggest otherwise, the fish usually known as albacore is a different species of tuna. The yellowfin tuna is sometimes referred to as albacore by French and Portuguese fishermen. It is the National fish of the Maldives.
