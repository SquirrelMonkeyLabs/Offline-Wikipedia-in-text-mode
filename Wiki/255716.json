 "text": "Table Football, Table Soccer and Foosball, are regional names of a table-top game based on association football (EUR) or soccer (USA). The name \"foosball\" comes from the German word for football, \"fussball\" or \"fu√üball\". Both a recreational game and a serious sport, the game can be played by two (singles) or four (doubles) players. Tables are broadly defined as professional or home- grade. The tables function the same, but just like pool tables, vary widely in features. Home-grade tables are great for kids and casual players. A professional grade table in a home game room is a sign of a serious player. Foosball is played world-wide and professional grade tables reflect unique characteristics of their country of origin. Serious players need the additional ball control, weight and strength the professional-grade products feature to handle four adult players. Currently the game of Foosball is again expanding in popularity. For serious players there are local, state, regional, national and international tournaments. . ==Other websites== *International Table Soccer Federation *Foosball table this year Category:Football",
