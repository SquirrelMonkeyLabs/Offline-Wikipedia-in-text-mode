 "text": "Income Support is a meanstested social security benefit in the United Kingdom for some people who are on a low income, but have a reason for not actively seeking work. People who get it may get Housing Benefit, Council Tax Reduction, Child Benefit, Carer's Allowance, Child Tax Credit and help with health costs. A person with savings over £16,000 cannot get Income Support, and savings over £6,000 affect how much Income Support they get. It is being replaced by Universal Credit. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom",
