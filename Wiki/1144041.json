 "text": "Felix V (born Amadeus VIII of Savoy, 4 September 1383 – 7 January 1451) was an antipope from 1439 to 1449, chosen by the Council of Basel during the Western Schism. He is remembered as the last antipope in church history. == Early life == Amadeus was born in Chambéry to the ruling family of the County of Savoy. He became the Count of Savoy in 1391 and later, in 1406, was elevated to the rank of Duke of Savoy. == Antipope == During the Western Schism, the Council of Basel opposed the authority of Pope Eugene IV and declared Amadeus as the new pope in 1439. After a long period of hesitation, Amadeus accepted the election and took the name Felix V. However, like other antipopes before him, Felix V did not gain widespread recognition. == Death == Felix V gave up his position as antipope in 1449, this helped Pope Nicholas V get elected which eventually ended the schism. Felix V died on 7 January 1451 in Geneva. Felix V is remembered as the last antipope in church history. == References == Category:Antipopes Category:1451 deaths Category:People from Chambéry Category:House of Savoy",
