He was also a candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 election. After ending his presidential campaign, McCotter decided to run again for his seat in Congress, but did not qualify in the 2012 primary. He was disqualified after most of his petition signatures were rejected as invalid and some of his staffers were found guilty of repeating and faking some signatures. ==References== ==Other websites== * Congressman Thaddeus McCotter official U.S. House website * * * Campaign finance reports and data at the Federal Election Commission (presidential) * Financial information at OpenSecrets (presidential) Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:United States representatives from Michigan Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:American radio personalities Category:Entertainers from Michigan Category:Writers from Detroit Category:Politicians from Detroit Category:2012 United States presidential candidates Category:People from Livonia, Michigan Category:Lawyers from Detroit",
