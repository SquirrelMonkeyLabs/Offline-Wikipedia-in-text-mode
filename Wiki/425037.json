 "text": "Emptiness is a sense of general boredom, feeling socially separated from other people, and feeling that you do not care any more. Feelings of emptiness often accompany depression, loneliness, or despair. A sense of emptiness is also part of a natural process of grief, caused by separation from or the death of somebody you love. While Christianity and Western sociologists and psychologists consider a state of emptiness as a negative, bad condition, in some Eastern philosophies such as Buddhist philosophy and Taoism, emptiness is seen as a real achievement.
