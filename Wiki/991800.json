 "text": "Child Benefit ( used to be called family allowance) is a Social Security benefit for people in the United Kingdom. It was started in 1946 by Clement Attlee's government. There was a tax allowance for children from 1909 to 1979. The Family Allowances Act 1945 set a rate of five shillings a week for each child, after the first. It was paid up to the age of 15. The amount increased over time. It was £1.50 for each child after the first in 1975. The age limit was then 18. In 1975 family allowances stopped. Child Benefit was paid for all children. £1 a week for the first child and £1.50 for the other children. An extra 50p was payable to single parents. In 1998, Tony Blair's government increased the first child rate by more than 20%. It stopped the single parent rate. The rate is £21.80 a week for the first child and £14.45 for the others. It is paid until the child is 16. If they are in approved education or training it goes on until their 20th birthday. From January 2013, people earning more than £50,000 per year have part of their benefit stopped. People earning over £60,000 do not get any. People who get means-tested benefits - Tax Credits or Universal Credit get extra money for children. Since 2017 there is a limit of two children per family for children born after 2017. The limit does not apply to adopted children, multiple births, or children born after rape. This leaves families £3,235 a year worse off for each additional child above the limit. It is one of the “biggest drivers” of child poverty. A person bringing up someone else’s child because the parents are dead or missing can get an extra payment called Guardian's Allowance. This is £18.55 a week a child on top of Child Benefit. Disabled children may get Disability Living Allowance. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom Category:Children",
