 "text": "The Colbert Report was an American television talk show starring Stephen Colbert. It was aired on Comedy Central Monday to Thursday, starting October 17, 2005. The last episode aired on December 18, 2014. It was a spin-off of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Colbert acts as if he is very conservative, as a parody. His show makes fun of different conservative political commentary shows, especially Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News. The show also has many guests, usually one each night on the last part of his show. They are authors, actors, politicians, musicians and others. He also sometimes has other guests in other segments in his show, such as Congress members in his \"Better Know a District\" segment. The show is directed by Jim Hoskinson. Colbert has also written three books with the writers of his show. The first book from 2007 is called I Am America (And So Can You!) as the character he plays on television. The show is aired in Canada on The Comedy Network, The Comedy Channel in Australia, and Comedy Central in New Zealand. The show won two Emmy Awards in 2013. It ended in December 2014. == Other websites == * *Colbert Nation Category:2005 American television series debuts Category:2014 American television series endings Category:2000s American television series Category:2010s American television series Category:American comedy television series Category:American television talk shows Category:Emmy Award winning programs Category:Television spin-offs Category:English-language television programs",
