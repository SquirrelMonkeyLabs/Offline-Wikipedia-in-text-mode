 "text": "Roger Keith \"Syd\" Barrett (6 January 1946 â€“ 7 July 2006) was an English musician. Barrett is most famous for founding the rock band Pink Floyd. He started the band in 1965 under several different names and wrote the band's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. During this time he experimented with psychedelic (mind-altering) drugs and eventually exited the band in 1968. Following his departure from Pink Floyd, he released two records, The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, to little commercial success, due to the unusual lyrics and unsteady beats. He later suffered from mental health issues, possibly related to his history of drug use. Some of his most successful solo songs are \"Dark Globe\" and \"Octopus\".
