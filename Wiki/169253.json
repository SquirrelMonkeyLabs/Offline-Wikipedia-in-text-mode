 "text": "A air pump is a pump that is used to inflate things, like a basketball. The pump often has a needle at the end and can be used to inflate other objects as well. Bicycle tires are normally filled with air. With extensive use, the tires may lose air and need to be inflated. When the air gets moved, an area of low pressure gets created which fills up with more air. == References == Category:Mechanics Category:Tools",
