 "text": "Negative film is the name for a photographic film that will give images which have their colors inverted, after development. This inversion means that the complementary color is used. A second process (usually called making a print) is used to obtain any number of photos, which can also be in different sizes. The other kind of film is called reversal film, also called slide film, where development results in a positive image (which uses true colors rather than complementary colors). Negative films that use colors have multiple layers. Each layer is sensitive to a different wavelength of light. Many amateur films in the 20th century were slide films; today most films are negative films. The benefits of this kind of film is that it is very tolerant to exposure differences, without noticeable loss in quality. Another benefit is that getting the film developed is very easy because it uses only 3 chemicals rather than 6 for reversal film. Category:Photography",
