 "text": "Michael Dapaah (born 10 August 1991) is a British actor, rapper, and comedian. He is also known as Big Shaq (or Roadman Shaq). In 2017, he made his mockumentary SWIL (Somewhere in London). The mockumentary focuses on four characters and their journey to success. His novelty song \"Man's Not Hot\" saw commercial success. It went to number three (meaning it is popular, but not popular enough to get to number one) on the UK Singles Chart. The song has been certified platinum in the United Kingdom by the BPI. Dapaah was born in Croydon, London, to immigrants from Ghana. ==Charting singles== Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications UK AUS AUT DEN GER NL NOR NZ SWE SWI \"Man's Not Hot\" (as Big Shaq) 2017 3 28 33 21 26 20 23 22 15 41 * BPI: Platinum * BEA: Gold * ARIA: 2× Platinum * BVMI: Gold * IFPI: Gold * GLF: Platinum * RMNZ: Gold \"Man Don't Dance\" (as Big Shaq) 2018 78 — — — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released in that territory. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Black British musicians Category:British comedians Category:British rappers Category:Black British actors Category:Ghanaian musicians Category:Musicians from London",
