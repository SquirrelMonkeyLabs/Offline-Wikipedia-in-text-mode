It premiered on ITV on July 4, 2005 and lasted 17 series until its cancellation on May 10, 2019. It was the most popular show on ITV. It aired in sessions, weekday morning and attracted 1 million viewers. It replaced the chat show Trisha. ==Features== The show is based on the confrontation of the guests trying to solve personal problems. It is often related to family and romantic relationships, sex and addiction. It features psychotherapist Graham Steiner, who assists guests during and after the show, and uses a polygraph, despite a lack of scientific evidence to support its use. ==Controversies== The Jeremy Kyle Show has been controversial for placing guests in confrontational situations. They often punished guests considered suspicious or morally irresponsible, while emphasizing the importance of values, traditional family, while guests often express strong emotions such as anger and pain. ==Cancellation== ITV countered claims that guests on the show were mistreated and misled by investigators. But a judge described the show as \"human bear bait\" in prosecuting the guests for violent behavior on the show\". On May 15, 2019, the show was cancelled due to the suicide suspicion of a guest whose appearance was filmed but not aired the last week of May 15, 2019. Category:Television talk shows",
