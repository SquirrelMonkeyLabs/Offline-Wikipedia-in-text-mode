 "text": "Sparta was an important Greek city-state in the Peloponnesus. It was unusual in that it had a diarchial system, with two kings ruling at the same time. The kings were called Arkhagêtai. They were hereditary rulers, and came from two separate dynasties. According to tradition, the two lines, the Agiads and Eurypontids, were descended from the twins Eurysthenes and Procles. These twins were said to be the descendants of Heracles, who conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War. The dynasties were named after the twins' grandsons, the kings Agis I and Eurypon. The Agiad line was regarded as being senior to the Eurypontid line.Cartledge, Paul, The Spartans, Vintage Books, 2003 Although there are lists of earlier Kings of Sparta, there is little evidence to show that any kings existed before the middle of the 6th century BC. ==Legendary kings== Many kings of Sparta are described in the Greek mythology. ===Lelegids=== * Lelex, a son of Poseidon or Helios * Myles, a son of Lelex * Eurotas, a son of Myles, father of Sparta ===Lacedaemonids=== * Lacedaemon, a son of Zeus, husband of Sparta * Amyklas, a son of Lacedaemon.
