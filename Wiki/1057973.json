 "text": "The WAGR S class were a pair of small well-tank steam locomotives operated originally by the Great Southern Railway (GSR) and later by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1888 to 1916. The S class were built by Kitson & Coy of Leeds, England in 1888 and 1892 for use at Albany as shunters for the Great Southern Railway, in 1896 the GSR was taken over by the WAGR, and both were withdrawn in 1915 and 1916. Both were sold to the Australian federal government to help in the construction of Henderson Naval Base in Perth (near Cockburn). In 1923 both were transferred to Canberra, ACT to construct Parliament House, the new base of the Australian government. In 1927 both were sold once more to NSW Associated Blue Metal Quarries, carrying numbers 1 and 2. No. 2 was scrapped in 1932 at Bass Point Quarry in Shellharbour, while No. 1 lasted a bit longer and after operating at Prospect Quarry, it was scrapped in 1938.
