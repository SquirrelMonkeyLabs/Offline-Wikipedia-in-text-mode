 "text": "The small bush frog (Raorchestes chotta) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in only one place: Ponmudi in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 600 and 980 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in evergreen forests and on one tea farm. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and is never a tadpole. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place and people are changing this place in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. People change the forests into farms for tea and areca nut. One of the places this frog lives is a park: Ponmudi Reserve Forest. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis could makethis frog sick because it can make other frogs in Raorchestes sick, but they are not sure. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
