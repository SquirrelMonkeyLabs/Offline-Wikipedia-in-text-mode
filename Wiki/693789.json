Selçuk Üniversitesi, Edebiyat Fakültesi, Sosyoloji Bölümü (in Turkish) He founded the foundation Osmanlılar İlim ve İrfan Vakfı, a neo- Ottoman monarchist NGO in 1994 and he led it until at least 2014. He worked to discredit the Turkish secular nationalist rule, and for him, living under Islamic rule in an enemy-occupied country was better than living under secular rule in a free country. He claimed that Joseph Stalin ordered his army to read the Quran on the sands against the Nazis, William Shakespeare was a secret Muslim whose name was Sheikh Pir, and Karl Marx's Das Kapital was dictated by demons. His works came under criticism by historian İlber Ortaylı for lacking scientific approach, knowledge and distorting the facts. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Turkish lawyers Category:Conspiracy theorists Category:Monarchists",
