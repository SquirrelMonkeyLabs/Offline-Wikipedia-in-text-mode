 "text": "Mani was an Iranian.. prophet who founded the religion of Manichaeism. He was a painter and that influenced his work such as the Arzhang. Mani was born in Mesopotamia. He was born in Al-Mada'in, which was part of the Parthian Empire at the time. Mani wrote eight major works, with seven written in Syriac and one written in Middle Persian.Henning, W.B., The Book of Giants, BSOAS, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52–74: \"...Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt that the Iranian names of Sām, Narīmān, etc., that appear in the Persian and Sogdian versions of the Book of the Giants, did not figure in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language.\" He was executed in Gundeshapur. == References == Category:Manichaeism",
