 "text": "In mathematics, a Pythagorean triple is a set of three positive integers which satisfy the equation (make the equation work): :a^2 + b^2 = c^2 This equation is known as the Diophantine equation, and is related to Pythagoras' theorem. The lowest Pythagorean triple is [3, 4, 5] because: :3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 : So, 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 The next highest triple is [5, 12, 13] then [7, 24, 25], and so on. There is an infinite number of Pythagorean triples. A Pythagorean triple always consists of: • all even numbers, or • two odd numbers and an even number. A Pythagorean triple can never be made up of all odd numbers or two even numbers and one odd number. Category:Number theory Category:Geometry",
