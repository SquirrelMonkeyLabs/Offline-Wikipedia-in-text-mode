 "text": "From 21 October 2019 until late November of that year, protests and marches occurred in Bolivia in response to claims of electoral fraud in the 2019 general election of 20 October. After 11 November 2019 there were protests by supporters of the outgoing government in response to Jeanine Áñez becoming the acting president of Bolivia. The claims of fraud were made after the suspension of the preliminary vote count, in which incumbent Evo Morales was not leading by a large enough margin (10%) to avoid a runoff. ==References== Category:21st century in Bolivia Category:October 2019 events Category:November 2019 events Category:2010s protests Category:2019 in South America",
