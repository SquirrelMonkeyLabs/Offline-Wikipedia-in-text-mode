 "text": "The Manchu alphabet is used to write the endangered Manchu language. The Xibe people also use a similar script, called Xibe script, which is considered either a dialect of Manchu or a closely related language. This alphabet is written vertically from top to bottom, with columns going from left to right. == History == In the 1800s, there were three ways to write Manchu: standard writing, semi-cursive writing , and cursive writing. The semi-cursive writing had letters closer together, while cursive writing had rounded tails. The Manchu alphabet was also used to write Chinese. For example, a book called \"Manchu: a Textbook for Reading Documents\" shows how Chinese sounds are written in Manchu letters. This helps the Xibe language borrow some words. Some books have Chinese words written with Manchu letters. The Manchu versions of the Thousand Character Classic and Dream of the Red Chamber are just Manchu writings of all the Chinese letters. In a book made by the Qianlong Emperor, the Manchu alphabet is used for Evenki (Solon) words. In another book, also made by the Qianlong Emperor, the Manchu alphabet is used to write down Tibetan and Chagatai (related to Uyghur) words. == Alphabets == Characters Transliteration Notes isolated initial medial final Vowels A second final form is used after ( ) and ( ).
