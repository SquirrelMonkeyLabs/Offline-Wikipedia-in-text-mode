 "text": "Dreamcutter is a 2023 side-scrolling platformer video game for Windows and Nintendo Switch. It was developed by indie studio Ten Pennyfingers. It is a Metroidvania-like platformer game, with an erotic-themed visual novel storyline. ==Plot== The protagonist and player-character is a girl named Haley who is stuck in a monster-infested dream world after falling asleep. The talking scythe, who is named Dreamcutter, promises her power and a chance to escape, but in exchange to submission to it, with unknown motives. Haley submits to the Dreamcutter and works together with her friend Lucia to navigate through the dream world. Haley and Lucia interact in dialog as part of the narrative, which includes sex scenes between them. ==Gameplay== Gameplay is a mix of both platforming and combat against enemies. The \"Dream Combo\" is the points system in the game and it (together with coins) allow the player to upgrade the scythe. Using these upgrades, the player gains the ability to glide and stick to walls. There are a total of 5 stages, each of which end with a boss battle. == Release == Dreamcutter was released in May 2023 on the GOG.com and Steam platforms. An updated patch was released a month later that added a \"SFW mode\". Eastasiasoft ported and published the game for Nintendo Switch. A physical limited edition in SteelBook and artwork of the characters was released by Funbox Media in June 2024. ==Reception== IGN's Vincent Peter wrote that Dreamcutter has \"intriguing characters with equally intriguing relationships\", further giving praise to the \"well-drawn\" art and color palette, although noting that the sprite-work is basic. He also liked what he called \"fast and fluid\" platforming action and the fanservice, but found the variety of enemies lacking. == References == Category:2023 video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:Video games about dreams Category:Windows games",
