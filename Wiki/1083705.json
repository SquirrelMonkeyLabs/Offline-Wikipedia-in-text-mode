 "text": "Nella Larsen (1891-1964) was an American nurse, librarian, and writer during the Harlem Renaissance. She was born in Chicago, and grew up in a mostly white neighborhood before attending high school for one year at Fisk University’s Normal School, which is a historically Black college and university (HBCU). After high school, Larsen moved to Denmark where she lived with relatives and spent three years (1909-1912) auditing courses from the University of Copenhagen. Considered an important figure of the Harlem Renaissance, Larsen was an accomplished writer. She was the first Black woman to be awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1930. Larsen was also awarded the Harmon Foundation’s bronze medal for Quicksand (2). Larsen’s works center middle class Black women and their experiences, focusing on topics such as marginality and mixed-race identity.
