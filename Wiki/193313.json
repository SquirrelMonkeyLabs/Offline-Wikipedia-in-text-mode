 "text": "The Telamiina 65 77 (Track mine model 66, with detonator model 77) is a Finnish Army standard issue anti-tank mine. The mine is made of 9.5 kg (~21 lbs) of cast TNT. The mine is armed with a detonator that is set to explode when at least 100 kg (~220 lbs) of pressure is applied to it. The blast effect of the mine blows the track off of tanks and damages their driving wheel. The mine is also known as the Kuntonappi (\"Fitness pill\") or the Tellu (female name, shortened form of Tellervo9). ==References== *http://www.mil.fi/maavoimat/kalustoesittely/index.dsp?level=70&equipment;=124 Category:Explosives",
