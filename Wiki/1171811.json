 "text": "The Songwriters Hall of Fame (SHOF) was founded in 1969 by songwriter Johnny Mercer, music publisher/songwriter Abe Olman, and publisher/executive Howie Richmond to honor songwriters. The Hall of Fame was formed in 1969, and in 2010, an exhibit was put on display online inside the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live in Los Angeles. The Hall has no permanent place of residence, and because the awards are not televised, there would be no other digital recording of the event. ==References== Category:1969 establishments in the United States",
