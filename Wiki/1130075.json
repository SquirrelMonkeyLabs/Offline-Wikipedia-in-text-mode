 "text": "Atypical antipsychotics, also called second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), are a group of medicines used to treat mental health problems. They help people with conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric disorders. == Definition == Atypical antipsychotics are newer medicines that treat psychosis and other mental health conditions. They work differently from older antipsychotics (called first-generation antipsychotics or FGAs) and often have fewer side effects. == History == The first atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, was made in the 1960s. More atypical antipsychotics were created in the 1990s. They became popular because they helped with symptoms and had fewer movement-related side effects than older medicines. == How Atypical Antipsychotics Work == These medicines are thought to work in the brain by: * Changing how certain chemicals (called neurotransmitters) work. * Affecting dopamine, which helps control movement and feelings. * Also affecting serotonin, which is involved in mood and thinking. * Having different effects on other brain chemicals, which can lead to different side effects for each medicine. == Types of Atypical Antipsychotics == Some common atypical antipsychotics are: * Aripiprazole (Abilify) * Quetiapine (Seroquel) * Risperidone (Risperdal) * Brexpiprazole (Rexulti) * Cariprazine (Vraylar) * Clozapine (Clozaril) * Lurasidone (Latuda) * Olanzapine (Zyprexa) * Paliperidone (Invega) * Ziprasidone (Geodon) == Uses == Doctors use atypical antipsychotics to treat: * Schizophrenia * Bipolar disorder * Severe depression (sometimes) * Autism (for some symptoms) * Tourette syndrome * Other psychiatric conditions == How They Are Given == Atypical antipsychotics come in different forms: * Pills * Liquid * Injections (some types) * Orally disintegrating tablets (that melt in the mouth) * Long-acting injections (given every few weeks or months) Patients usually take them every day, but some are given as injections that last weeks or months. == Side Effects == Like all medicines, atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects: * Weight gain and metabolic changes (like diabetes and high cholesterol) * Feeling sleepy or dizzy * Dry mouth or constipation * Blurred vision * Faster heartbeat * Changes in how the body moves (called extrapyramidal symptoms) * Increased prolactin levels (a hormone) == Related pages == * Antipsychotic == References == Category:Drugs used in psychiatry",
