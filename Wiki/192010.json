Their recorded play goes back as far as the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) in 1889, although the Quebec Hockey Club is known to have played in tournaments prior to that date. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908, and eventually playing in the National Hockey League. The Bulldog name was given by the media and was so popular with the fans a Bulldog mascot was created but was never officially changed until the team moved to Hamilton, Ontario in 1920 and became the Tigers. ==Season-by-season record== * 1888–1898 – Amateur Hockey Association of Canada * 1899–1905 – Canadian Amateur Hockey League * 1906–1909 – Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association * Jan. 1910 – Canadian Hockey Association * 1910–1917 – National Hockey Association * 1919–1920 – National Hockey League Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against Season GP W L T Pts GF GA Finish Postseason 1888–89 Data incomplete 1890 Data incomplete 1891 Data incomplete 1892 Data incomplete 1893 8 2 5 1 4 23 46 4th, AHAC Did not qualify 1894 8 5 3 0 10 26 27 4th, AHAC Did not qualify 1895 8 0 8 0 0 18 27 5th, AHAC Did not qualify 1896 8 4 4 0 8 23 23 3rd, AHAC Did not qualify 1897 8 2 6 0 4 22 46 4th, AHAC Did not qualify 1898 8 2 6 0 4 29 35 4th, AHAC Did not qualify 1899 8 0 8 0 0 12 31 5th, CAHL Did not qualify 1900 8 2 6 0 4 33 52 5th, CAHL Did not qualify 1901 8 1 7 0 2 21 43 5th, CAHL Did not qualify 1902 8 4 4 0 8 26 34 4th, CAHL Did not qualify 1903 7 3 4 0 6 30 46 4th, CAHL Did not qualify 1904 8 7 1 0 14 50 37 1st, CAHL Did not challenge for Stanley Cup 1905 10 8 2 0 16 78 45 2nd, CAHL Did not qualify 1906 10 3 7 0 6 57 70 4th, ECAHA Did not qualify 1907 10 2 8 0 4 62 88 5th, ECAHA Did not qualify 1907–08 10 5 5 0 10 81 74 3rd, ECAHA Did not qualify 1909 12 3 9 0 6 78 106 3rd, ECAHA Did not qualify 1910 3 2 1 0 6 20 22 CHA Season incomplete 1910–11 16 4 12 0 8 65 97 5th, NHA Did not qualify 1911–12 18 10 8 0 20 81 79 1st, NHA Won O'Brien Trophy Won Stanley Cup 1912–13 20 16 4 0 32 112 75 1st, NHA Won O'Brien Trophy Won Stanley Cup 1913–14 20 12 8 0 24 111 73 3rd, NHA Did not qualify 1914–15 20 11 9 0 22 85 85 3rd, NHA Did not qualify 1915–16 24 10 12 2 22 91 98 3rd, NHA Did not qualify 1916–17 1 10 2 8 0 4 43 80 6th, NHA Did not qualify 1916–17 2 10 8 2 0 16 54 46 2nd, NHA Did not qualify 1919–20 1 12 2 10 0 4 44 81 4th, NHL Did not qualify 1919–20 2 12 2 10 0 4 47 96 4th, NHL Did not qualify Totals 312 132 177 3 267 1422 1662 Note: 1 = first half of season, 2 = second half of season ==Notable players== ===Hall of Famers=== * Rusty Crawford * Thomas Dunderdale * Joe Hall * Joe Malone * Paddy Moran * Tommy Smith * Bruce Stuart * Hod Stuart ===Team captains=== This list is incomplete. * Hod Stuart (1901) * Herb Jordan (1905) * Joe Malone (1910–17, 1919–20) ===1912 Stanley Cup Champions=== * Paddy Moran – goal * Goldie Prodgers – point * Joe Hall – cover point * Joe Malone – centre * Eddie Oatman – right wing * Jack McDonald – left wing * Jack Marks – sub * Walter Rooney – centre sub * George Leonard – sub * Joe Savard – sub goalie ===1913 Stanley Cup Champions=== * Paddy Moran goal * Joe Hall – point * Harry Mummery – cover point * Joe Malone – centre * Tommy Smith – right wing * Jack Marks – left wing * Russell Crawford – sub * Billy Creighton – sub * Jeff Malone – sub * James \"Rockett\" Power – sub * Walter Rooney – sub * Joe Savard – sub goalie ==Other articles== *List of defunct NHL teams *List of Quebec Bulldogs players *Head Coaches of the Quebec Bulldogs *List of NHL players *List of Stanley Cup champions *Hamilton Tigers *New York Americans *Quebec Nordiques *List of NHL seasons *List of pre-NHL seasons ==References== * ==Other websites== *http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/quebecnha/bulldogs.html *http://quebecbulldogs.com/ Category:1888 establishments in Canada Category:Ice hockey teams in Quebec Category:Sport in Quebec City",
