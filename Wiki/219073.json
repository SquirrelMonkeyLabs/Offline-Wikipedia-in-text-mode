He played the saxophone, guitar, drums, keyboards and trumpet, and he sang. He was also a human rights activist. The American singer James Brown said that Kuti was one of the originators (starters) of the funk genre. Kuti died in 1997 of Kaposi's sarcoma, an illness caused by AIDS. In 2008 a musical production called Fela! was created, about Kuti's life and career. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Deaths from AIDS Category:Disease-related deaths in Nigeria Category:Drummers Category:Nigerian guitarists Category:Deaths from sarcoma Category:Nigerian singers Category:Saxophonists Category:Trumpeters",
