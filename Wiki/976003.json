 "text": "Peasants at work (also known as Contadine al lavoro) is a 20th-century late filippinism painted in oil by Umberto Boccioni. It was painted about 1908, in Milano, Italy. This work by Boccioni is of great importance as it highlights the long research and study work that he dedicates to the Lombard landscape and to the work of the fields inspired by the master of the Italian landscape Francesco Filippini, before modifying his own works in the futurism movement. == Other websites == * Francesco Filippini Category:Paintings by Umberto Boccioni Category:1900s paintings",
