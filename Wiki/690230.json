 "text": "An outwash plain is a plain made by a melting glacier. As the glacier moves, it picks up dirt and rocks. When the glacier melts, the dirt and rocks are left behind. The smaller dirt and rocks are carried further by the water the melting glacier makes. This makes the outwash plain very flat and smooth. Category:Landforms",
