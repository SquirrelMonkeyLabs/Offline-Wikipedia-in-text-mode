 "text": "Arsenic pentoxide, also known as arsenic(V) oxide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is As2O5. It has arsenic and oxide ions in it. The arsenic is in its +5 oxidation state. More common is arsen in its oxidation state +3 as As2O3 (arsenic trioxide or arsenic(III) oxide). The LD50 for arsenic pentoxide is 8mg/kg for rats. When the substance becomes wet, it turns into arsenic acid, which corrodes metals. ==Properties== Arsenic pentoxide is a white, odourless solid. It dissolves easily in water to make arsenic acid. It is highly toxic, as are almost all arsenic compounds. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine. As2O5 breaks down to arsenic trioxide and oxygen when heated to about 300Â°C. :As_2O_5 + 268.1 kJ \\rightarrow As_2O_3 + O_2 It reacts with bases to make arsenates. The energy for the reaction is taken from the heating. ==Preparation== Arsenic pentoxide cannot be produced by burning arsen. That only results in As2O3. To produce arsenic pentoxid, arsenic acid will be dehydrated. This is done with phosphorus(V) oxide. :2 H_3AsO_4 \\rightleftharpoons As_2O_5 + 3 H_2O The arsenic pentoxide drops out as white powder. ==Uses== Arsenic pentoxide is used to make pesticides and insecticides. It is also used in glass industry. ==Related pages== *Arsenic pentafluoride *Arsenous acid *Phosphorus pentoxide *Antimony pentoxide == References == Category:Arsenic compounds Category:Oxides",
