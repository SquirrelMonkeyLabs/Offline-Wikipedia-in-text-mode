 "text": "A bounty is a payment or reward of money to find, capture or kill an outlaw or a wanted person. Two modern examples of bounties are the ones placed for the capture of Saddam Hussein and his sons by the United States government and Microsoft's bounty for computer virus creators. Those who focus their time on bounties as a career are known as bounty hunters. Bounties have also been given for other reasons, such as exports under mercantilism. ==References== Category:Law enforcement",
