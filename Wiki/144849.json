 "text": "In Major League Baseball, the American League Championship Series (ALCS), played in October, is a playoff round that decides the winner of the American League pennant. The winner of the series moves on to play the winner of the National League Championship Series in baseball's championship, the World Series. It is a \"best-of-seven\" series, meaning the first team to win four games ==History== In 1969, MLB expanded the leagues to two divisions. As a result, the League Championship Series was implemented. Originally, it was a best-of-five series, meaning a team had to win three games to advance to the World Series. In 1985, the LCS was expanded to a best-of-seven format. Since 1995, the two winners of the ALDS advance to the ALCS. ==List== Click the link on the far left for detailed information on that series.
