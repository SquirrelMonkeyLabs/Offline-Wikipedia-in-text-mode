 "text": "Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+02:00) (sometimes called Central European Daylight Time) is the name for a time zone. It is a daylight saving time. Some of the countries that have Central European Time shift their clocks forward one hour, during the summer months and shift it one hour backwards during winter months. A research station called Troll in Antarctica uses this time zone in the winter, but uses Greenwich Mean Time in the summer. The part of Europe using this time zone has had many changes from Central European Summer Time. It is because the Sun is not matching with the time in their areas. They have also stopped using the timezone multiple times. ==Where it is used== The following countries and territories use Central European Summer Time: * Albania, since 1974 * Andorra, since 1985 * Austria, since 1980 * Belgium, since 1980 * Bosnia and Herzegovina, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia * Croatia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia * Czech Republic, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia * Denmark (metropolitan), since 1980 * France (metropolitan), since 1976 * Germany, since 1980 * Gibraltar, since 1982 * Hungary, since 1980 * Italy, since 1968 * Kosovo, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia * Liechtenstein, since 1981 * Luxembourg, since 1981 * Malta, since 1974 * Monaco, since 1976 * Montenegro, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia * Netherlands, since 1977 * North Macedonia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia * Norway, since 1980 * Poland, since 1977 * San Marino, since 1966 * Serbia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia * Slovakia, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia * Slovenia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia * Spain, since 1974 (except Canary Islands, which instead apply Western European Summer Time) * Sweden, since 1980 * Switzerland, since 1981 * Vatican City, since 1966 The following countries have also used Central European Summer Time in the past: * Libya, 1951-1959, 1982-1989, 1996-1997, 2012-2013 * Lithuania, 1998-1999 * Portugal, 1993-1995 * Tunisia, 2005-2008 == References == Category:Time zones",
