 "text": "Superman is an ice cream flavor. It is usually a red, blue, and yellow swirl. It was invented in the Midwestern United States in the early 20th century, mainly Michigan and Wisconsin. You can also buy it at ice cream parlors, such as Baskin Robbin's or Hershey's ice cream sellers in the United States. It was invented before Superman, the DC Comics superhero character, but is often thought to be named after him, as his costume uses those colors. Makers never license Superman's name, often instead using a different name to avoid legal issues. Many brands use different flavors. The blue ice cream is often Blue Moon, which has a hard-to-place flavor. It was also invented in the early 20th century, and can also be bought in the United States at ice cream parlors that sell Hershey's ice cream, as well as some grocery stores and gas stations. Superman is thought to have been invented by Stroh's Ice Cream in Detroit, Michigan during the Prohibition Era. == Brands and flavors == Producer Brand Blue flavor Red flavor Yellow flavor Stroh's Ice Cream \"Super Rainbow\" Blue Moon Red Pop (Strawberry) Lemon United Dairy Farmers \"Super Moo\" Blue Vanilla Cherry Vanilla Hudsonville Ice Cream \"SuperScoop\" Blue Moon Black Cherry Vanilla Meijer (Purple Cow) \"Scooperman\" Blue Moon Black Cherry Vanilla Cedar Crest Ice Cream \"Superman\"/\"Super Madness\" Blue Raspberry Cherry Vanilla Laura Secord Chocolates \"Super Kid\" Blueberry Strawberry Banana Kroger \"Tie Dye Burst\" Blue Moon Cherry Vanilla Perry's Ice Cream \"Super Hero\" Blue Raspberry Cherry Bubble Gum Lemon Well's Blue Bunny \"Scooper Hero\" Vanilla Vanilla Vanilla Hershey Creamery Company \"Superman\" Blue Moon Strawberry Banana ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:American food Category:Ice cream Category:Superman",
