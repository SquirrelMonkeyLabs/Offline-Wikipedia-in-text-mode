 "text": "The WAGR Eca class were a total of 9 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1920 to 1925. The Eca class were the result of reducing the weight of the Ec class 4-6-2 heavy-duty goods engines to run on lighter-laid lines that required more motive power. Conversions started in 1920 but were halted in 1923 when all Ec and Eca class locos were drastically rebuilt as the L class to modernise them for the 1920s.
