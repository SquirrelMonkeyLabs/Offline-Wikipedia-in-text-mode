Beta Monocerotis is a triple star system. The three stars form a triangle which looks to be in one spot. William Herschel commented that it is \"one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens\".http://90millimeter.org/2013/02/17/monocerotis/ Monoceros also has Plaskett's Star. It is a big binary system. Its whole mass is said to be that of almost 100 Suns put together.
