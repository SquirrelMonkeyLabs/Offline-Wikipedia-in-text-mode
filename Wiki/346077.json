 "text": "The gnateaters are a bird family, Conopophagidae. They are made of ten small passerine species in two genera. They live in South and Central America. They are very closely related to the antbirds and less closely to the antpittas and tapaculos. Gnateaters are not studied or known as much because of their remote habitat. However, they are often watched by birdwatchers. Gnateaters feed on insects. They catch them in the understory of South American forests. == References == Category:Tyranni",
