 "text": "Saeeda Etebari is an Afghani jewelry artist. Etebari had meningitis when she was one, causing her to be deaf. She joined the Turquoise Mountain Institute for Afghan Arts and Architecture and trained in jewelry-making. She was chosen to have an exhibition at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. == Early life == Etebari was born in a Pakistani refugee camp. She was the third of nine children. When she was only one years old, she developed meningitis. Meningitis is a disease that, for Etebari, resulted in hearing loss and not being able to speak. Etebari couldn’t go to school, so her dad founded a deaf school for her to learn. Etebari speaks sign language. Etebari signs about the struggle of accepting that she was deaf and mute, but now she thinks of it somewhat as a blessing. == Schooling == After graduating, Etebari’s brother suggested she apply to Turquoise Mountain Institute. At Turquoise Mountain, she studied handmade jewelry design. Etebari’s talents were noticed there, as she excelled in her work. Etebari considers being deaf a blessing for her, for when she goes to work on jewelry, the loud noises of tools don’t affect her concentration. == Smithsonian Exhibition == Etebari was chosen with Abdul Matin Malekzadah and Sughra Hussainy, to have an exhibition at the Smithsonian Museum. Etebari’s work is inspired by the culture of where she grew up in Afghanistan. One of Etebari’s more famous pieces is an emerald and gold necklace that she designed with British jeweler Pippa Small. This piece was displayed at the Smithsonian. == References == Category:Afghan people Category:Jewelry Category:21st-century Afghan people",
