 "text": "The Shanxi clique, also known as the Jin clique (; Jin is the short name of Shanxi) was a military clique in China during the Warlord Era. Yan Xishan was its warlord. == History == After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, Yan Xishan waited for a year before removing Yuan's supporters in Shanxi, gaining power. Yan did not fight in China's civil wars, but he would fight other soldiers if they invaded Shanxi. In 1927, the Fengtian clique tried to make Yan Xishan join their side in the Northern Expedition, but he joined the Kuomintang. He also took part in the Central Plains War (1930) but lost. == References == === Citations === === Sources === * * * Category:History stubs",
