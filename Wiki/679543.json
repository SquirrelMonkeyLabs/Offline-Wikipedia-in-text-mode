 "text": "The Cooler is an American 2003 romantic-drama movie. Its director is Wayne Kramer. In old-school gambling, a \"cooler\" is an unlucky individual, usually a casino employee. ==Plot== Unlucky Bernie Lootz doesn't have much good going for him. He lives in a dreary place: a studio apartment in a run-down motel next to the Las Vegas Strip. He cannot recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman. He's in debt to Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow. Kaplow cured Lootz' habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz' casino debts. Lootz' debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is not satisfied with the casino business. He tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. But his future success as a luck \"cooler\" is changed when he meets cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario. She becomes interested in him. Lootz' luck. His luck, and the luck of those around him, take turns for the better. What Lootz doesn't know yet is that Shelly may have paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working for Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is Natalie has fallen in love with Lootz, and vice versa. Other complications hit when Shelly, a relative old-timer, resists efforts from new Shangri-La owner advisers who want to update the casino hotel property and bring the hotel into the 21st century. ==Cast== * William H.
