 "text": "An equestrian statue shows a person riding a horse. The word comes from Latin: \"eques\" means 'knight' and \"equus\" means 'horse'. A statue of just a horse without a rider is called an equine statue. Making a full-sized equestrian statue is difficult and expensive for any culture. These statues usually depict rulers or military leaders, especially during the Renaissance and in recent times.",
