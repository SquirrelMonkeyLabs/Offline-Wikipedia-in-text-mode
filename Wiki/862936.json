She participated in the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Commonwealth Games. ==2020 Olympics== Podmore reached the criteria for being qualified for the COVID-19 delayed 2020 Summer Olympics. She was, however, not chosen by the New Zealand Olympic Committee. ==Personal life== Podmore was born in Christchurch, New Zealand. Three months after turning 24, Podmore died in Cambridge on the North Island. The actual cause of Podmore's death is unknown. But there is a strong possibility Podmore may have killed herself due to having depression. Podmore's final Instagram post read: Sport is an amazing outlet for so many people, it’s a struggle, it’s a fight but it’s so joyous. The feeling when you win is unlike any other, but the feeling when you lose, when you don’t get selected even when you qualify, when [you're] injured, when you don’t meet society’s expectations such a owning a house, marriage, kids all because [you’re] trying to give everything to your sport is also unlike any other. ==References== ==Other websites== * Liv Podmore at New Zealand Olympic Organization Category:Suicides Category:Sportspeople from Christchurch Category:1997 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Olympians for New Zealand Category:New Zealand cyclists",
