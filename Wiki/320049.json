 "text": "Sweden was first at the Olympic Games at the inaugural 1896 Games. They have been in every Games since then with one exception for the 1904 Summer Olympics. Sweden has earned medals at all Olympic games except for two, the 1896 Games and the 1904 Games. Sweden hosted the Games on one occasion, the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. The equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne were held in Stockholm, due to quarantine reasons. Swedish athletes have a total of 475 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 118 at the Winter Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee had Swedish officer and sports instructor Viktor Balck as one of its original members. The Swedish Olympic Committee was formed and recognized in 1913. ==Sweden's Olympic Games bids== ===Swedish Summer Olympic Games bids=== Games Location Result 1912 Stockholm Only application 1956 Stockholm Shared games alongside Melbourne 2004 Stockholm Eliminated against Athens and Cape Town ===Swedish Winter Olympic Games bids=== Games Location Result 1984 Gothenburg Eliminated against Sarajevo and Sapporo 1988 Falun Eliminated against Calgary 1992 Falun Eliminated against Albertville and Sofia 1994 Östersund Eliminated against Lillehammer 1998 Östersund Eliminated against Nagano and Salt Lake City 2002 Östersund Eliminated against Salt Lake City 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 Winter Games bids were declared non-finished applications by the Swedish Olympic Committee, due lack of political support from the Swedish government. The reason has been that the bidding is financially insecure for the Swedish society as a nation. 2018 Winter Olympic Games bids were promised support by the former government, but when the new government was elected, the bid was withdrawn. Östersund and Åre were the only applicant cities. ==Medal tables== ===Medals by Summer Games=== Rank 1896 Athens 0 0 0 0 - 1900 Paris 0 0 1 1 20 1904 St. Louis did not participate did not participate did not participate did not participate 1908 London 8 6 11 25 3 1912 Stockholm 24 24 17 65 2 1920 Antwerp 19 20 25 64 2 1924 Paris 4 13 12 29 8 1928 Amsterdam 7 6 12 25 4 1932 Los Angeles 9 5 9 23 4 1936 Berlin 6 5 9 20 7 1948 London 16 11 17 44 2 1952 Helsinki 12 13 10 35 4 1956 Melbourne/ Stockholm 8 5 6 19 6 1960 Rome 1 2 3 6 16 1964 Tokyo 2 2 4 8 17 1968 Mexico City 2 1 1 4 20 1972 Munich 4 6 6 16 11 1976 Montreal 4 1 0 5 12 1980 Moscow 3 3 6 12 11 1984 Los Angeles 2 11 6 19 16 1988 Seoul 0 4 7 11 32 1992 Barcelona 1 7 4 12 27 1996 Atlanta 2 4 2 8 29 2000 Sydney 4 5 3 12 18 2004 Athens 4 2 1 7 19 2008 Beijing 0 4 1 5 55 2012 London 1 4 3 8 37 Total* 143 164 176 483 10 ===Medals by Winter Games=== Rank 1924 Chamonix 1 1 0 2 7 1928 St. Moritz 2 2 1 5 3 1932 Lake Placid 1 2 0 3 3 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen 2 2 3 7 3 1948 St. Moritz 4 3 3 10 1 1952 Oslo 0 0 4 4 10 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo 2 4 4 10 5 1960 Squaw Valley 3 2 2 7 5 1964 Innsbruck 3 3 1 7 7 1968 Grenoble 3 2 3 8 7 1972 Sapporo 1 1 2 4 10 1976 Innsbruck 0 0 2 2 14 1980 Lake Placid 3 0 1 4 5 1984 Sarajevo 4 2 2 8 5 1988 Calgary 4 0 2 6 5 1992 Albertville 1 0 3 4 13 1994 Lillehammer 2 1 0 3 10 1998 Nagano 0 2 1 3 17 2002 Salt Lake City 0 2 5 7 19 2006 Turin 7 2 5 14 6 2010 Vancouver 5 2 4 11 7 Total* 48 33 48 129 ===Medals by summer sport=== Wrestling 28 27 20 84 Athletics 19 21 41 81 Equestrian 17 11 14 42 Shooting 15 23 18 56 Canoeing 15 11 4 30 Sailing 10 12 13 35 Modern pentathlon 9 7 5 21 Swimming 8 14 13 35 Diving 6 8 7 21 Gymnastics 5 2 1 8 Cycling 3 4 8 15 Fencing 2 3 2 7 Table tennis 1 1 1 3 Football 1 0 2 3 Tug of war 1 0 0 1 Boxing 0 5 6 11 Tennis 0 3 5 8 Handball 0 3 0 3 Archery 0 2 0 2 Rowing 0 2 0 2 Water polo 0 1 2 3 Triathlon 0 1 0 1 Weightlifting 0 0 4 4 Total* 140 162 175 477 ===Medals by winter sport=== Cross-country skiing 27 17 19 63 Speed skating 7 4 5 16 Figure skating 5 3 2 10 Alpine skiing 5 2 9 16 Biathlon 3 1 6 10 Ice hockey 2 3 5 10 Curling 2 1 1 4 Ski jumping 0 1 1 2 Nordic combined 0 1 1 2 Freestyle skiing 0 1 0 1 Snowboarding 0 1 0 1 Total* 51 35 49 135 *Total medal counts include six medals – three gold, two silver, and one bronze – awarded in the 1908 and 1920 figure skating events. These medals are included in the summer games medal totals and the winter sport medal totals. This is why the totals for summer and winter games do not match the totals for summer and winter sports. ==Related pages== * List of IOC country codes == References == ==Other websites == * * Sweden profile at London2012.com Category:Nations at the Olympics Category:Sport in Sweden",
