 "text": "On Monday, June 8, 1953, a powerful F5 tornado went right across the city of Flint, Michigan and its suburb Beecher. The latter city had 113–114 people dead following the severe tornado. Before the 2011 Joplin tornado in Joplin, Missouri, it was the final tornado that lead to triple-digit death tolls in the United States. ==Related tornadoes== Other tornadoes also hit lower Michigan and northern Ohio. The overall outbreak killed 116 or 117 in Michigan alone. Affected states also included Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, New York and Massachusetts. The overall people who died from June 6 through 9 was 247 (some reports mention higher numbers). The full damage went beyond $340 million (1953 USD; almost $3.3 billion 2021 USD). Michigan's deaths alone were 125. Others were killed across Nebraska, northern Ohio and east-central Massachusetts (mostly around Worcester). The last-said state's tornado was its very most expensive (costing $53 million) before 1979. ==References== Category:Tornado outbreaks Category:Tornadoes in the United States Category:Natural disasters in the United States Category:20th century in Ohio Category:20th century in New York (state) Category:20th century in Nebraska Category:20th century in Michigan Category:20th century in Massachusetts Category:20th century in Iowa Category:1950s in the United States Category:1950s in weather",
