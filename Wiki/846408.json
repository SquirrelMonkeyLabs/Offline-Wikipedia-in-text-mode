 "text": "The Dyke March is a lesbian visibility and protest march. It is similar to the Gay Pride parade and gay rights protests. The main reason for the creation of Dyke Marches was to protest what was seen as the control of Pride events by white gay men. Dyke marches often happen on a Friday or Saturday before LGBT pride parades. Dyke marches are held in Minneapolis, New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Buffalo, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, Before \"Dyke March\" was a concept, one of the first documented lesbian pride marches in North America was in Vancouver, British Columbia in May 1981. The first Dyke March was in Washington, D.C. on April 24, 1993. ==References== Category:LGBT rights",
