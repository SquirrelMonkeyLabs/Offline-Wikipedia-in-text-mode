 "text": "In the airline industry, a focus city is an airport that is important to one airline but is not a hub. An airline has daily flights from the Focus city to many destinations that are also not its hubs. Even though the word \"city\" is part of this term, it means a city's airport, not the city. An example of an airline's focus city is US Airways (now part of American Airlines) at Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.About US Airways, usairways.com, retrieved 2011-Mar-16 Focus city airports can have some of the same facilities that hubs have. For example, the airline may repair or clean their aircraft at a focus city because it is cheaper. They might also have places and equipment to handle cargo. Many low-cost carriers that mostly fly point-to-point use focus cities more than hubs. Southwest Airlines,Singe, Kerry Hall and Steve Harrison.
