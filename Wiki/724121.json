Montipora corals are common on reefs and lagoons of the Red Sea, the western Indian Ocean and the southern Pacific Ocean. They are entirely absent in the Atlantic Ocean. This coral grows in plates. It can cover huge portions of a reef. The coral is attached permanently to the ocean floor. It spreads out into thin, wide, leaf- like colonies. Larger colonies can grow out in multiple layers. Its surface is covered with many bumpy protrusions. == Diet == It gets most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its cells. == References == Category:Cnidarians",
