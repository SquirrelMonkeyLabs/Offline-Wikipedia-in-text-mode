 "text": "Amia is a genus of primitive freshwater fish in the family Amiidae of the order Amiiformes. They are the sole surviving species of the order Amiiformes. The two living species are Amia calva and Amia ocellicauda. == Species == The following is a species list: * Amia calva Linnaeus, 1766 (Bowfin) * Amia ocellicauda Richardson, 1836 (Eyespot bowfin) * †Amia godai Yabumoto & Grande, 2013 (Miocene of Japan) * †Amia? hesperia Wilson, 1982 (Eocene Okanagan Highlands) * †Amia pattersoni Grande & Bemis, 1998 * †Amia scutata Cope, 1875 == Evolution == === Neopterygii === Neopterygians, subclass Neopterygii, are the second major occurrence in the evolution of ray-finned fish and today include the majority of modern bony fish. The Neopterygii is a very successful group of fishes, because they can move more rapidly than their ancestors. Their scales and skeletons began to lighten during their evolution, and their jaws became more powerful and efficient. === Amiiformes === Amiiformes is an order of freshwater fish. The order has only two extant fish, the bowfin and the eyespot bowfin. They are found in the freshwater systems of North America, in the United States and parts of southern Canada. They live in freshwater streams, rivers, and swamps. == References == # Froese, R.; Pauly, D. (2017). \"Amiidae\". FishBase version (02/2017). Retrieved 18 May 2017.
