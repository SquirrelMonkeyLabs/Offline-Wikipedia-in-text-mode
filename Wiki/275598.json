 "text": "The Wild Bunch were a sound system based in the St Pauls area of Bristol, England from 1983 to 1986. The group was known for playing sets that drew large crowds on the club scene and had performed shows as far away as London. They performed in soundclashes against other Bristol sound systems. The Wild Bunch's sound used a lot of different musical styles - an unusual thing at the time. Their shows included parts of punk, R&B; and reggae, with a use on slower rhythms and ambient electronic music that would become a start of the Bristol sound, more popularly known as trip-hop. They were a key member of what became the Bristol underground scene. The Wild Bunch is perhaps best known for having been the first group of several notable British DJs and performers: * Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall and Andrew Vowles, went on to form Massive Attack in 1987. * Tricky, also a part-time member of the outfit, performed with Massive Attack on their first and second full-length releases, Blue Lines and Protection respectively, before pursuing a successful solo career. * Nellee Hooper, who moved to London after the group's dissolution and worked as a producer and remixer for a number of major artists, including Madonna, U2, No Doubt, Bj√∂rk and Massive Attack themselves. He won the 1995 BRIT Award for Best Producer. He was also a member of Soul II Soul. ==References== Category:Musical groups",
