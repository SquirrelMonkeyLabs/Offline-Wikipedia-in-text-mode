 "text": "The WAGR T class were a total of 10 steam locomotives originally operated by the Great Southern Railway (GSR) and later the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1888 to 1952. The T class were built from 1887 to 1889 by Beyer, Peacock & Coy of Manchester, England and Kitson & Coy of Leeds, England for the GSR, standard practice on the GSR was the naming of locomotives rather than numbering and class designation, the first of the line was named Hordern, and so the class have been nicknamed the \"Hordern class\" unofficially. On the GSR they were used on mainline trains, also handling all through mail from Albany to Perth. When the GSR was taken over by the WAGR in 1896, they continued working their normal routes until the turn of the 19th century when larger locomotives began replacing them. They became relegated to shunting and utility work, hauling niche trains like the Commissioner's inspection train. Withdrawals of the T class began in 1924 to 1926, and continued again in 1940, with the last two withdrawn and scrapped in 1948 and 1952.
