 "text": "Algae Lake is a narrow lake that is 17 kilometers long and between 0.4 km to 1.9 km wide. It is east–west in the ice-free Bunger Hills of Antarctica. It was first mapped from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946 to 1947. It was called \"Algae Inlet\" by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names because the algae changed colours. It extends to the meltwater ponds overlying the Bunger Hills and to the saline inlets and channels in the Highjump Archipelago. Later Soviet Antarctic Expeditions (1956–1957) found this \"inlet\" to be a lake and changed its name to Algae Lake instead of \"Algae Inlet\". == References == Category:Antarctica",
