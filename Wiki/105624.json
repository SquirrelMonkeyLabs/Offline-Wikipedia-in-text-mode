 "text": "A level crossing (also called a grade crossing, a railway crossing, or a railroad crossing) is a place where a railway line and a road meet each other on the same level. This means that the grades (the road and the track) are not separated by using a bridge or a tunnel. Usually, there are signs indicating the crossing. There may also be barriers/gates that go down before a train passes. Depending on how much traffic there is, there are different measures to make the crossing more secure: * Signs or panels, indicating the crossing * Blinking or steady lights * Sounds (usually a warning bell) * Gates/barriers that are lowered before a train passes Since level crossings are dangerous (there are many accidents), they are usually reworked into grade separated crossings when there is more traffic, or high speed trains. == Images == File:Bahnuebergang ungesichert Taunusbahn.jpg|Unsecured crossing indicated by a sign.
