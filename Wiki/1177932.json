 "text": "Las Escaleras' skunk frog (Aromobates cannatellai) is a frog. It lives in TÃ¡chira, Venezuela. ==Body== One adult male frog was 22.6 mm long from nose to rear end. The head is longer than it is wide. The skin of the frog's back is dark with small brown spots near the front of the body. There are two dark brown stripes from the nose over the eye to the back of the body. The sides of the body are black with a stripe that can have white spots on it. There are other white spots on the top of the mouth and near where the front legs meet the body. The front legs are black in color. The belly is light gray in color. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for Dr. David Cannatella of the University of Texas at Austin. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams in forests. Scientists saw the frog between 1130 and 1300 meters above sea level. ==Young== The male frogs sit on the dead leaves on the ground or under rocks and call to the female frogs. Scientists think this frog has young the way other frogs in Aromobates do: the female frog lays eggs on land near streams and the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is in big danger of dying out and scientists from Venezuela say it is in some danger. People change the places where the frog lives to make dams and places for people to visit. People also make farms, which put bad chemicals in the water, and take water to use. Disease could also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
