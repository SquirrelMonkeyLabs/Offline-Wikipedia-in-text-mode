 "text": "The Second Dynasty ruled ancient Egypt from c. 2890 to c. 2686 BC It is the second dynasty of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. During this time the seat of government was centred at Thinis. Very little is known about this period in ancient Egyptian history. There is very little archaeological evidence of the time. But to compare the differences between the First and Third Dynasties shows that there must have important institutional and economic developments during the Second Dynasty. ==Rulers== The names of the rulers of the Second Dynasty is not known exactly. Most sources agree on the names of the first pharaohs. These are: Name Years Reigned Hotepsekhemwy 38 Nebra (maybe identifiable with Weneg). 10â€“14 Nynetjer 40 Senedj (maybe identifiable with Horus Sa.) 20 The names of the next two or three rulers is unclear. We may have both the Horus-name or Nebty (meaning two ladies) name and their birth names for these rulers, however they may be entirely different individuals; or they may be legendary names. On the left are the rulers most Egyptologists place here; on the right are the names from Manetho's Aegyptica: Proposed Ruler Manetho's List Seth-Peribsen Kaires Nepherkheres Sekhemib- Perenmaat Sesokhris With the last ruler, we return to an agreement: Name Years Reigned Khasekhemwy 17-18 Manetho wrote that the capital was at Thinis, the same as during the First Dynasty. However, at least the first three kings were buried at Saqqara. This could mean the center of power had moved to Memphis. Beyond this, little can be said about the events during this period. The annual records on the Palermo Stone only survive for the end of the reign of Nebra and for parts of Nynetjer's. One important event possibly happened during the reign of Khasekhemwy: many Egyptologists read his name (\"the Two Powers arise\") as commemorating the union of the Upper and Lower Egypts. ==References== Category:3rd millennium BC in Egypt",
