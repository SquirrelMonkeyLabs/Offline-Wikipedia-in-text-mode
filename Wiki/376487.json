Quranists reject the Hadiths as they believe that the Hadith literature which exists today is apocryphal, as it had been written three centuries after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; thus, it cannot have the same status as the Quran.> Quranists believe that obedience to Muhammad means obedience to the Qur'an, and not the hadith. Several extra- Qur'anic traditions upheld by Sunnis are regarded as idolatry (shirk) by Quranists.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QoShEAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA57&dq;=Quranists+Shirk&hl;=en&newbks;=1&newbks;_redir=0&source;=gb_mobile_search&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjWm4rMmaCLAxVTUkEAHZDzMz0Q6AF6BAgHEAM#v=onepage&q;&f;=false == Related pages == *Sola scriptura, the Christian equivalent *Hadith rejectors, Muslims who reject the authority of the hadiths *Muwahhidism, the concept of returning the Islamic faith back to its original foundations The Romani word for Muslim Roma, are Xoraxane Roma, (Khorakhane, Horahane or Korane Roma), the meaning is word for word Koran followers ==References== ==Further reading== * (Although well-intentioned, Mirza shows misunderstanding or misinterpretation of some Quranic verses relating to fasting, Ramadan and Hajj.
