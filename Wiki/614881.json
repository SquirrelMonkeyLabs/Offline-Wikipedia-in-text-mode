It includes the neighborhoods of Fernwood, Princeton Park, Lilydale, the southern portion of West Chesterfield, Rosemoor, Sheldon Heights and West Roseland. George Pullman planned a model industrial city built around a factory that manufactured his \"Palace\" railway coaches. The much lauded mural \"I Welcome Myself to a New Place: Roseland Pullman Mural,\" by Olivia Gude, Jon Pounds, and Marcus Jefferson, 1988, was designed to unite the predominantly African American community. The community is known for being one of the most violent of the city with high numbers of gang violence. ==Other websites== * Official City of Chicago Roseland Community Map *Roseland photos, videos and message board * Torgan, Allie. \"Grandmother helping Chicago kids 'off the block'.\" CNN.
