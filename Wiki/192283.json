 "text": "The Mini is a small car made by the British Motor Corporation (BMC), British Leyland and Rover from 1959 to 2000. It used a transverse engine and front- wheel drive, where the turning power was put on the front wheels of the car rather than the back wheels. Its design saved a large amount of space. It allowed most of the car's size to be used for passengers and luggage. It had only two doors, but could seat up to four passengers. 1959 The design was very influential for car-making in the second half of the 20th century. In 1999, the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T. https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/24/automobiles/this-just-in- model-t-gets-award.html \"This Just In: Model T Gets Award\"], James G. Cobb, The New York Times, 24 December 1999 Alec Issigonis was searching for the ideal C V joint for a front wheel drive car, when William Cull the Chief Engineer of Scott Motors realised he knew of the ideal joint, Mr Cull bought the rights for the CV joint from the American holder and sold them to Hardy Spicer of Birmingham, after making samples in his workshop in Shipley, Yorkshire. Hardy Spicer bought Mr Culls Business and he became the MD of a division of the Company making the joints. (ref Jack Pool, Keighley news Jan 13 1994) The original model is considered an icon of the 1960s in Britain. The original Mini was designed for BMC by Alec Issigonis. It was first released in August 1959. Rover ceased production in October 2000. It was marketed under the names Austin, Morris, Cooper, Wolseley, Riley, British Leyland and Rover. In 2001, the Mini was relaunched by BMW as a premium small hatchback which quickly became popular thanks to its retro styling, fun driving experience, many customisation options and strong resale values. It received redesigns in late 2006 and late 2013.
