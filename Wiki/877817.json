 "text": "Agalychnis terranova is a frog that lives in Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 240 and 900 meters above sea level. The adult frog is about 46.9 mm long from nose to rear end. The female frogs are larger than the male frogs. This frog has green skin on its back with many warts. This frog looks very much like other Agalychnis frogs, but its sides are orange with white spots instead of blue. Scientists believe this frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. This species is near threatened. That means it is not in danger of dying out yet but it could become in danger. It is near threatened because human beings like to dig mines in the places where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
