 "text": "A nanny state is a term for a government or country with laws that tell people how to behave and how to live their private lives. The reasons may vary. Some may be to protect people's health, or to protect society. It is called paternalism when the government thinks they know better than the people. When someone calls a government a nanny state, they are accusing it of taking away too much of their personal freedom. ==Related pages== *Big government == References == Category:Politics Category:Pejoratives",
