He won the 1901 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for making a serum to stop people getting the disease diphtheria ==Biography== Behring was born on March 15, 1854, in Hansdorf, Deutsch-Eylau. He was the oldest son in a large family of 13 children. Because his family couldn't afford to send him to a university, he joined the Army Medical College in Berlin in 1874. This allowed him to study medicine without financial burden but required him to serve in the military for several years after graduating in 1878 and passing his state exams in 1880. He was then sent to work in Poland, where he studied diseases and the effects of iodoform, discovering it could neutralize toxins from bacteria. In 1882, he published his findings. Recognizing his talent, the military health department sent him to Bonn for further training. In 1888, he returned to Berlin to work at the Institute of Hygiene under Robert Koch, where he collaborated with other scientists like Paul Ehrlich. In 1894, Behring became a professor of hygiene in Halle and later moved to a similar position in Marburg in 1895. == References == Category:1854 births Category:1917 deaths Category:German academics Category:German doctors Category:German Nobel Prize winners Category:People from former German territories Category:Prussian scientists",
