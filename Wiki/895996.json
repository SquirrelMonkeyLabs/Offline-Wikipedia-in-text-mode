 "text": "The heredia tree frog (Ecnomiohyla fimbrimembra) is a frog that lives in Costa Rica and Panama. Scientists have seen it between 500 and 1500 meters above sea level in Costa Rica and between 1600 and 1700 meters above sea level in Panama. The adult frog is a color between light purple and brown, with darker color on its mouth and yellow on its throat. Younger frogs are a mixture of brown, yellow, and green that looks like lichen. The frogs have large pieces of skin, called fringes, on its legs. This frog lives in forests that have trees no more than 20 meters tall. They like forests with lots of water in the air, where epiphyte plants grow. Epiphytes are plants that do not have roots in the ground. They sit on taller plants instead. As of the late 20th century, scientists did not know much about this frog. They had only ever seen one tadpole. They found it in a small hole in the ground in 1986. Scientists think this frog can glide through the air using the skin from its fringes like wings. They have seen other frogs with fringes doing this, for example Cope's brown tree frog. Cope's brown tree frog is related to the heredia tree frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
