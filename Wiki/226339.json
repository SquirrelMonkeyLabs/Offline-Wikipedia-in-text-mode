 "text": "An apocalypse is a revelation: seeing something which has been hidden. It comes from the Greek word, Apokálypsis, which means \"lifting of the veil\", or finding out something secret. Often this secret is discovered in a dream or a vision. When used in everyday speech, it usually means “the end of the world”, based off of its religious use. In religion, the word describes Armageddon (the end of the world). This might have come from the Greek words, apokalupsis eschaton, meaning all the secrets will be discovered \"at the end of the æon, or age\". In Christianity The Apocalypse of John is the Book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible. It describes the end of the world, and the second coming of Jesus Christ.
