 "text": "Coastal flooding happens when dry and low-lying land is submerged by water. The range of a coastal flooding event is from the elevation of floodwater. It is controlled by topography of coastal land exposed to flooding. Coastal floods are largely natural events. Human influence on the coastal environment, though, can make coastal floods worse. Storms, including tropical cyclones can cause flooding from storm surge, and rising sea levels from climate change. Category:Severe weather",
