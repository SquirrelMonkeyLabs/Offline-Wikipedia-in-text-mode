 "text": "In physics, a quantum (plural: quanta) is a very small object that is involved in some interaction. It has one of several possible states. Theoretical physics uses quanta for calculations. There are special sciences such as quantum mechanics, or quantum thermodynamics that study quanta, and their interactions. Examples: * Photons are quanta of the electromagnetic field. * Phonons are quanta of mechanical distortions in a solid * Plasmons * Magnons * Gluons are quanta of the force field that transmits the strong interaction * Gravitons Category:Basic physics ideas",
