 "text": "The Republic of China (Taiwan) is one of Asia's most tolerant countries as far as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights are concerned. The government proposed a bill in 2003 to make same-sex marriage legal. It has so far stalled without passage. If the law passes, the ROC would be the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriages. In 2017, the ROC's Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex marriage should become legal within two years. The ROC is also described as the most liberal after over 30,000 people went to the Taiwan Pride parade in 2010 and 2011, making it the largest LGBT event in Asia. On May 17, 2019, the Legislative Yuan approved a bill, submitted by the Executive Yuan, recognising marriage for same-sex couples. The bill was signed into law by President Tsai Ing-wen on 22 May and went into effect on 24 May. Taiwan therefore became the first country in Asia to recognise same-sex marriage. ==Living conditions== Same-sex sexual activity legal (Always Legal) Equal age of consent (Always Equal) Anti-discrimination laws in employment (Since 2007) Anti-discrimination laws in education (Since 2004) Anti- discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services (Since 2017) Anti- discrimination laws in all other areas (incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech) (Since 2017) Same-sex marriage (Since 2019) Recognition of same-sex couples (Nationwide Since 2019) Stepchild adoption by same-sex couples (Since 2019) Joint adoption by same-sex couples (Since 2022) LGB people allowed to serve in the military (Since 2002) Transgender people allowed to serve openly in the military (Since 2022) Right to change legal gender (Since 2008, but requires sex reassignment surgery) Third gender option (From 2020) Intersex minors protected from invasive surgical procedures (Since 2022) Conversion therapy banned by law (Since 2018) Homosexuality declassified as an illness Access to IVF for lesbians (Since 2022) Automatic parenthood for both spouses after birth (Since 2022) Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples (Since 2022) MSMs allowed to donate blood (Since 2022) ==References== ==Other websites== *Taiwan Pride Taiwan Category:Politics of Taiwan Category:LGBT in Asia",
