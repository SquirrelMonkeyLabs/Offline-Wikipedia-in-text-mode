 "text": "The southern cricket frog, savannah cricket frog, savannah cricket, cricket frog, Florida cricket frog, southeastern cricket frog, or coastal plain cricket frog (Acris gryllus) is a frog. It lives in the southeastern United States in Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Mississippi, and Florida. This frog is small. It is about 1.6-3.2 mm long from nose to rear end. It has a dark triangle mark between its eyes. There is a light stripe from the eye to the front leg. This frog lives in lowlands and in river valleys. People have seen it near ponds, bogs, and areas with rivers. Because this frog cannot climb very well, it moves away from danger by hopping or going into the water. It can jump 2 feet (60 cm) up in the air and 3-4 feet (90-120 cm) across. There are at least two subspecies of this frog: Acris gryllus gryllus and Acris gryllus dorsalis. A. g. gryllus has two dark stripes with light color around them on each hind leg. It has warts near its rear end. A. g. dorsalis has two dark lines on each hind leg and no warts. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
