 "text": "The City of Brisbane is a local government area (LGA) in South East Queensland that includes the majority of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland. Unlike other capital cities in Australia where the LGA with the city's name in it only represents the inner-city suburbs located in a small part of the central business district, the City of Brisbane is unique because it represents a large portion of the Brisbane metropolitan area. Because of this, it is the most populous local government area in Australia. The other local government areas in Brisbane are the City of Logan in the southwest, the City of Moreton Bay in the north, and the City of Redland in the southeast. The City of Brisbane is administered by the Brisbane City Council, which meets at Brisbane City Hall. The head of the Brisbane City Council is the Lord Mayor, currently Adrian Schrinner of the Liberal National Party (LNP). Unlike other councils in Australia, the Brisbane City Council acts similar to a mini state parliament, with a formal structure similar to that of a parliament, as well as single-member constituencies called wards that have names and are elected like state electoral districts. Like all councils in Australia, the Brisbane City Council is unicameral, meaning it only has one chamber. ==References== Category:Brisbane Brisbane",
