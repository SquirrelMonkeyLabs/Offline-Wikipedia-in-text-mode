 "text": "The carbon-hydrogen bond (C–H bond) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms. It can be found in many organic compounds. This bond is a covalent bond. Carbon–hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 Å (1.09 × 10−10 m). It has a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol. Using Pauling's scale—C (2.55) and H (2.2)—the electronegativity difference between the carbon and hydrogen atoms is 0.35. == References == Category:Organic chemistry Category:Chemical bonding",
