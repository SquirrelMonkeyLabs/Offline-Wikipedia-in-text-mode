 "text": "Paul Lawrence Modrich (born June 13, 1946) is an American biochemist. He is known for his research on DNA mismatch repair. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2015, together with Aziz Sancar and Tomas Lindahl. He was born on June 13, 1946, in Raton, New Mexico to Laurence and Margaret Modrich. He has a younger brother Dave. His father was a biology teacher and coach for basketball, football and tennis at Raton High School where he graduated in 1964. == His work == He works primarily on strand-directed mismatch repair. His lab demonstrated how DNA mismatch repair serves as a copyeditor to prevent errors from DNA polymerase. Matthew Meselson previously proposed the existence of recognition of mismatches. Modrich performed biochemical experiments to study mismatch repair in E. coli. They later searched for proteins associated with mismatch repair in humans. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:American biochemists Category:American Nobel Prize winners Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Scientists from New Mexico",
