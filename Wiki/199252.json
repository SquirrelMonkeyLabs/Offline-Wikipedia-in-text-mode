 "text": "The Little River forms the western boundary of Cook County, Georgia. It is dammed at Reed Bingham State Park forming a lake for fishing, swimming, and recreation. There are two interesting structures along the river near the Cook and Brooks County line. A few years ago, the Adel News ran a story about a \"stone bridge\" over the river. It still stands and was built entirely from poured cement. It was abandoned around 1940 when the road took a different path. About three miles south another bridge, with its middle section missing, crosses what looks like a small pond. Category:Rivers of Georgia (U.S. state)",
