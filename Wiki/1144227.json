 "text": "The Yaduvanshi Rajputs or Yaduvanshi Thakurs are believed to be the descendants of Lord Krishna. According to the Hindu texts, the Yaduvansh is a sub-branch of the Chandravansh (Lunar dyansty of the Rajputs or Kshatriyas). The Yaduvanshi Rajput clans are as follows: * Jadaun or Jadon * Jadeja * Bhati * Chonker or Chokker * Chudasama The Karauli princely state royal family claims to be the direct descendants of Lord Krishna and have all the proofs for their claim. The present and 43rd king since 1984, Maharaja Krishna Chandra Pal Deo Bahadur of Karauli is the descendant of Raja Bijay Pal ji, the 88th descendant of Lord Krishna who originated from the Jadaun Yaduvanshi kingdom of Mathura. The other Yaduvanshi Rajput royal families include the Bhati Rajvansh of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan and the Jadeja Rajvansh of Rajkot, Gujrat. These royal familes too claim descent from Lord Krishna. They have turned their old ancestral forts into resorts and five star hotels at present. Moreover, there are number of Jadaun Rajput villages around the Vrindavan region of UttarPradesh which is the religious birth place of Lord Krishna. The people and the priests around India address Lord Krishna as ‘Thakur ji’ for the same reason of Yaduvanshi lineage of the Lord. == References == Category:Clans",
