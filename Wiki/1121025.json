 "text": "Art the Clown is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the Terrifier franchise. He was created by Damien Leone. The character first appeared in the short movies The 9th Circle (2008) and Terrifier (2011). Both shorts were part of the movie All Hallows' Eve (2013). He is mainly played by David Howard Thornton and began appearing in Terrifier (2016), Terrifier 2 (2023) and Terrifier 3 (2024). Art became a pop culture figure and iconic evil clown after the success of Terrifier 2. The character's background is unknown, although all of his appearances show him having supernatural powers. His archenemies are the final girls Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) and Victoria Heyes (Samantha Scaffidi). Leone wrote Sienna and Art as a symbolism of good and evil. Leone's idea of Art came from his idea of a woman getting off work and taking the city bus home, where a clown gets on and sits across from her, teasing her. He also sees Art as a combination of being uncomfortable and funny to viewers, but with the character becoming more aggressive. The character has been called \"the horror icon of the 2020s\". ==References== Category:Clowns Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional demons and devils Category:Monsters Category:Supervillains Category:Horror movie characters",
