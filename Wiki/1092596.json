 "text": "Nintendo Space World was a yearly trade show hosted by Nintendo. It was also known by its former names Shoshinkai and Famicom Space World. It ran from 1989 until 2001. There was not a convention in 1998 because Nintendo wasn't able to show enough new games for the 64DD. Nintendo would use these events to show new games that they were working on, as well as new consoles and other news. Some things that were announced at these conventions were never released, like the Super Mario 128 project. The last convention was held from August 24â€“26, 2001. During the convention, the upcoming GameCube was shown alongside the recently released Game Boy Advance. A clip from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was also shown. The Wind Waker clip recieved backlash from people who didn't like the cel-shaded art style the game was in. ==References== ==Other websites== *Archive of Nintendo Space World 2001 website (in Japanese) Category:1989 establishments Category:2001 disestablishments Category:Nintendo Category:Entertainment in Japan Category:Festivals",
