 "text": "The WAGR Msa class were a total of 10 Garratt steam locomotives that was run by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1930 to 1963. The Msa class were designed as a slightly altered design of the Ms class (superheated M class), specifically for a record-heavy harvest of wheat in 1930. The Msa was the first Garratt constructed in the Southern Hemisphere, being built by Midland Railway Workshops. They proved a great success, though wasted coal when compared to the Ms class and couldn't have all their parts unchanged with the Ms class. One was withdrawn in 1962 and the rest in 1963. One was supposed to be preserved but was accidentally scrapped by mistake, leaving nothing behind. == Gallery == File:Western Australian Government Railways class Msa Garratt articulated steam locomotive -- elevation and plan drawing.jpg|Detailed diagram of the Msa class.
