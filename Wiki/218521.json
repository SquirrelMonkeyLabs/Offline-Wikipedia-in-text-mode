 "text": "The Neogene is the second geological period of the Cainozoic. It began 23 million years ago, and ended about 2.6 million years ago. Before the Neogene was the Palaeogene. The Neogene and the preceding Palaeogene were originally together considered one period, the Tertiary. The Neogene has two stages: Miocene, and Pliocene. It is followed by the Quaternary. Some geologists think that the Neogene cannot be clearly distinguished from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.Tucker M.E. 2001.

ISBN 978-0-632-05735-1 The global climate became seasonal and with an overall drying and cooling trend. The ice caps on both poles began to grow and thicken. By the end of the period the first glaciation of the current Ice Age began. Marine and continental flora and fauna have a modern appearance. Mammals and birds adapted to various habitats. The first humans (belonging to the species Homo habilis) appeared in Africa near the end of the period.Lourens L; Hilgen F; Shackleton N.J; Laskar J. & Wilson D. 2004. The Neogene Period.
