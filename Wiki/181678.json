The title is not normally used for the wife of a head of government who is not also head of state. First Gentleman is used where the head of state's spouse has been a man, such as the Philippines or Malta. While there has never been a male spouse of a U.S. President, \"First Gentleman\" is used in the United States for the husband of a governor. First Spouse, a rare version of the title, can be used in either case where the spouse of a head of state is male or female. This term is used to promote gender equality and gender neutrality. ==References==",
