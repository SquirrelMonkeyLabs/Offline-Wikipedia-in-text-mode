 "text": "On 27 November 2024, a coalition of Syrian opposition groups called the Military Operations Command led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied Turkish-backed groups in the Syrian National Army (SNA) launched an offensive against the pro-government Syrian Arab Army (SAA) forces in Idlib, Aleppo and Hama Governorates in Syria. It is codenamed Deterrence of Aggression by HTS and stated as being launched in retaliation for the increased SAA firing of civilians in the Western Aleppo countryside. On 29 November 2024, HTS and the Syrian Democratic Forces entered Aleppo and captured most of the city, during the collapse of pro-government forces. On 4 December 2024, fierce clashes erupted in Hama province as the Syrian army engaged Islamist-led insurgents in a bid to halt their advance on the key city of Hama. Government forces claimed to have launched a counteroffensive with air support, pushing back rebel factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), around six miles from the city. However, despite reinforcements, the rebels captured the city on 5 December. The fighting led to widespread displacement, with nearly 50,000 people fleeing the area and over 600 casualties reported, including 104 civilians. On 7 December 2024, President Bashar al-Assad fled the capital of Damascus after the city was taken. ==Notes== ==References== Category:November 2024 events Category:December 2024 events Category:2024 in Syria Category:Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria",
