 "text": "The Jervis Bay tree frog (Litoria jervisiensis) is a frog from Australia. It lives near the ocean in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. It does not live in Jervis Bay. The adult male frog is 29 to 37 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 33 to 44 mm. These frogs have yellow colouring where their front legs meet their bodies. They live in eucalyptus forests, other forests, and on plants near streams. They also live on sandy dunes and lagoons near the ocean. Unlike other frogs that live in New South Wales, Jervis Bay tree frogs like to lay eggs in the cold parts of the year. They lay eggs in on underwater sticks. They take 12 weeks to transform into frogs. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
