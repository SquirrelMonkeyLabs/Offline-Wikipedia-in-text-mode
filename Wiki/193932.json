She is one of the most widely known African American women of the 19th century. Her freedom was linked with the passage of a New-York State Law in 1799 that began the process of gradual emancipation. She lectured widely on the cruelties she had experienced as a slave. She is best known for her \"Ain't I a Woman?\" speech, given at the Woman's Rights Convention of 1851. She also gave out speeches about abolishing slavery. Also, she became active in the Underground Railroad, helping blacks escape to freedom.
