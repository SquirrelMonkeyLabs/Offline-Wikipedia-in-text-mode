The most common snake they eat is the garter snake. == Venom == The timber rattlesnake is one of North America's most dangerous snakes. Before biting, they usually warn people by shaking their rattle at the end of their tail. Its venom contains a neurotoxin known as canebrake toxin, and is a phospholipase A2. It also contains a small basic peptide that works as a myotoxin, a fibrinogen-clotting enzyme that can produce defibrination syndrome, and a bradykinin-releasing enzyme. CroFab antivenom is used to treat envenomations from the timber rattlesnake. == Conservation status == The timber rattlesnake is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The timber rattlesnake is endangered in New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia, New Hampshire, Indiana, and Ohio. It is threatened in New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas.
