 "text": "Fair trade is a social movement which tries to help people who make things in developing countries. It helps people to work in better conditions and get more money for what they make, giving workers opportunities to improve their lives and plan their future, which reduces poverty as a result. The movement also tries to protect or improve the environment. Fair trade helps people in developing countries sell things to people in developed countries. Things that are sold in international trade are handicrafts and other manufactured goods, agricultural products such as grains, coffee, cocoa, sugar, tea, bananas, honey, cotton, quinoa, fresh fruit, chocolate, wine, flowers, and minerals such as iron and petroleum. Merchandise that has fair trade status must be given a fair trade certificate. This says it follows rules about fairness to workers and the environment. This will mean the product can put the Fairtrade symbol on their packaging if they earn the certificate. ==Related pages== *Moral purchasing *Oxfam == Other websites == *FLO International *FLOCERT Category:Trade",
