 "text": "Evan Mecham ( ; May 12, 1924 – February 21, 2008) was an American businessman and politician. He was the 17th governor of Arizona from January 5, 1987, until his impeachment conviction on April 4, 1988. He was very unpopular in Arizona because many of the things he said were seen as racist and was accused of hiring close friends and family to high state jobs. Mecham was removed from office following conviction in his impeachment trial on charges of obstruction of justice and misuse of government funds—funds. In his later career, he unsuccessfully ran for governor again and for the United States Senate against John McCain. Mecham died at a retirement home in Phoenix, Arizona on February 21, 2008 from problems caused by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease at the age of 83. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Governors of Arizona Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:State legislators of the United States Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:Politicians from Utah Category:Businesspeople from Utah Category:Businesspeople from Arizona Category:People from Glendale, Arizona Category:Disease-related deaths in Arizona",
