The council has 16 members. These members are elected by the people of the village. In the 2014 election, 9 members of the FWG and 7 of the SPD were elected. The honorary mayor is Ute Klenk-Kaufmann. === Coat of arms === The village’s arms has two halves. They are divided vertically. On the left is a crowned lion. It is standing on its hind legs and facing left. The right half has a green branch with two green apples. == Culture == === Museums === ==== Deinotherium at the town hall ==== The Dinotherium-Museum in Eppelsheim holds fossil remains of mammals from deposits about ten million years old from the prehistoric Rhine near Eppelsheim. These deposits are known as the Deinotherium Sands, because they often contain teeth and bones from the extinct proboscid deinotherium. == Paleontological discoveries == Besides the dinotherium fossils, the femur of a Paidopithex rhenanus was found in the area in the 19th century. This was a now-extinct catarrhine primate. In 2017, researchers reported finding teeth of an ape dating to about 9.7 million years ago. The teeth seem to belong to a kind of ape similar to Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis), but that animal first appeared in Africa more than 4 million years later. == References == ==Other websites== * Municipality’s official webpage in English * The discovery of the Deinotherium of Eppelsheim Category:Municipalities in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Towns in Rhineland-Palatinate",
