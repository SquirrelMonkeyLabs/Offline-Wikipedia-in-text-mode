 "text": "Some Muslims have more extreme views than others. Their teachings are called Islamic extremism, Islamist extremism, or radical Islam. People do not agree what exactly Islamic extremism is: there are different definitions. Also, some people call the teachings of certain groups within Islam extremist, but the groups themselves do not see their teachings as extremist. Political definitions of Islamic extremists usually say that Islamic extremists oppose \"democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.\" Islamic extremism is different from Islamic fundamentalism or Islamism. Islamic fundamentalists want to establish an Islamic state in countries where there is a Muslim majority. Islamism has similar teachings: There is Islamic law, and followers of Islamis think it should be applied. Acts of violence done by Islamic terrorists are often associated with Islamic extremism. == References == Category:Islam",
