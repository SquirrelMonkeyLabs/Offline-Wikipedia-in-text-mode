They came in through the central countryside of the Quneitra Governorate with artillery fire. After the fall of Damascus, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that since the Syrian Arab Army had left its positions, the 1974 border agreement with Syria was not active anymore. They did this to prevent any possible threat in Syria and Netanyahu ordered the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to take over the Purple Line. The Israeli Air Force and Navy began strikes on military targets across Syria in an operation named Operation Bashan Arrow. ==Notes== ==References== Category:December 2024 events Category:2024 in Syria Category:January 2025 events Category:February 2025 events",
