 "text": "The Malta Summit was a meeting between U.S. President George H. W. Bush and U.S.S.R. leader Mikhail Gorbachev. It took place between December 2â€“3, 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was their second meeting following a meeting that included then President Ronald Reagan, in New York in December 1988. During the summit, Bush and Gorbachev would declare an end to the Cold War, although whether it was truly such is a matter of debate. ==Other websites== *CNN: Cold War Interviews, Episode 24: Transcripts from Malta Summit * David Hoffman, \"Bush and Gorbachev Hail New Cooperation\", Washington Post (December 4, 1989) * Richard Lacayo, \"Turning Visions into Reality\" , in Time (online): December 11, 1989 * Romesh Ratnesar, \"Condi Rice Can't Lose\" , in Time (online): September 20, 1999 Category:1989 in Europe Category:George H.
