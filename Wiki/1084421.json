 "text": "The false hourglass tree frog or yellow tree frog (Polypedates pseudocruciger) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 200 and 950 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees and on the lower plants. It lives in pine-needle tree forests not too high above sea level, in swamps, and in grassy forests. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over ponds that dry up for part of the year. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people cutting down its forests may harm it. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
