 "text": "Andrew Chan (12 January 1984 - 29 April 2015) was an Australian citizen convicted and executed in Indonesia for drug smuggling. Chan was born in Sydney, New South Wales on 12 January 1984. He was the son of Cantonese- speaking Chinese immigrants. He was convicted in Indonesia for drug trafficking as a member of the Bali Nine. In 2005, he was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were believed to have arranged the heroin smuggling operation. After a criminal trial on 14 February 2006, Chan was sentenced to execution by firing squad. While in prison, Chan converted to Christianity. On 16 January 2015, Chan and Sukumaran were ordered to be executed after nine years in jail. On 6 February 2015, the government said that this would take place at the end of the month. On 11 February 2015 the government said that Chan and Sukumaran would be moved from Kerobokan prison to Nusakambangan Island where the execution would take place. On 24 February 2015 their lawyers challenged Indonesian President Joko Widodo's refusal to grant clemency. This legal challenge failed. The prisoners were moved to Nusakambangan Island on 4 March. On 6 April 2015, Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers went to the state administrative court in a last try to stop the executions; this was unsuccessful. On 24 April 2015, the government ordered the final preparations for the execution of Chan and Sukumaran, as well as eight others on death row. The pair, along with seven other death row inmates, were given a 72-hour notice of their executions on 25 April (ANZAC Day). On 27 April 2015, Chan married his Indonesian fiancee Febyanti Herewila. He was executed by firing squad on 29 April 2015. On 2 May 2015, the bodies of Chan and Sukumaran arrived back in Sydney along with the Sukumaran family and Chan's widow Febyanti Herewila, while the rest of Chan's family arrived back a day earlier. ==References== Category:1984 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Australian Christians Category:Australian criminals Category:Australian drug dealers Category:Australian prisoners Category:People executed by firearm",
