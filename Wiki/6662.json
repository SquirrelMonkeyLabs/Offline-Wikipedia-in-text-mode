The Assembly meets once a year, which usually begins on the third Tuesday in September and ends in mid-December. The first meeting was held on 10 January 1946. Voting in the General Assembly on important questions, for example suggestions on world peace, human rights and security, is by two- thirds of those present and voting. Other questions are decided by popular vote. Each member country has one vote. At present, the Holy See (Vatican City) and Palestine are the only two observer states at the United Nations. Switzerland also had that status until it became a member state. The current President of the United Nations General Assembly is Phil√©mon Yang since 10 September 2024.
