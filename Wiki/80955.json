 "text": "Magnolia is a genus of about 210 to 340 species. The Angiosperm taxonomical names Magnoliophyta (division) and Magnoliopsida (class) come from this genus. Charles Plumier gave a flowering tree from the island of Martinique the genus name Magnolia, after French botanist Pier Magnol. Magnolia is an ancient genus. It appeared before bees evolved. The flowers are thought to have evolved by encouraging pollination by beetles. To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough. Many magnolias that have pretty flowers are used as street trees.Street tree list Urban Tree Foundation == References == Category:Magnoliaceae Category:Trees",
