 "text": "Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, formerly the official name for Libya, was a state led by Muammar Gaddafi's unique political ideology, known as the Third International Theory. Gaddafi held power for over four decades until his overthrow in 2011. The regime faced international criticism for human rights abuses, and its collapse led to ongoing political instability and conflict in the region. In 1977 Libya became \"Al-Jamahiriya al-`Arabiyah al-Libiyah ash- Sha`biyah al-Ishtirakiyah al-Uzma\" . In English, the name means the \"Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\". ==Name== The official name \"Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\" was used for Libya from 1977 to 2011. \"Jamahiriya\" translates to \"state of the masses\" in Arabic, reflecting Muammar Gaddafi's political ideology. The term \"Arab\" denotes the country's cultural and linguistic affiliation. ==History== The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, established by Muammar Gaddafi in 1977, was characterized by his unique political philosophy called \"Jamahiriya,\" emphasizing direct people's rule. Gaddafi's rule faced both domestic opposition and international isolation. The nation experienced economic challenges, and Gaddafi's controversial policies led to conflicts, including the Lockerbie bombing. In 2011, the Arab Spring fueled a rebellion, resulting in NATO intervention and Gaddafi's overthrow. Post-Gaddafi Libya has struggled with political instability and security issues. ==References== Category:1977 establishments in Africa Category:2011 disestablishments Category:History of Libya",
