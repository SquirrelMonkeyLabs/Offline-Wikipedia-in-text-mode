 "text": "Moksha is the ultimate spiritual goal in some schools of Hinduism, similar to the concept of Nirvana in Buddhism. In Sanskrit, \"moksha\" means freedom. It refers to a state of eternal bliss and emptiness. According to Vedanta, life is a continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Hindu scriptures describe Moksha as liberation from this cycle, reaching a state of eternal bliss and emptiness beyond the happiness, pain, and sorrow experienced in the physical world. The goal for Hindu practitioners is to achieve Moksha, or freedom from the material world, through the practice of different forms of Yoga: Jnana Yoga (knowledge), Karma Yoga (work), and Bhakti Yoga (devotion and worship). Moksha is a concept from the Vedas. While scholars differ on the specific relationship between Moksha in Vedanta Hinduism and Nirvana in Buddhism, they agree that the concepts are historically and philosophically related. Similar ideas can be found in the Upanishads. Hindu texts explain Moksha as SaccidƒÅnanda, or true bliss, which comes from separating the soul from the physical body through Dhyan (meditation) and Yoga. The term \"Moksha\" comes from the Sanskrit word \"Moksa.\" In essence, Moksha is a state beyond ordinary understanding; it is a profound experience that can only be fully comprehended upon achieving it.
