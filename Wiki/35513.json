Dr Jekyll changes into his evil self, Edward Hyde. Hyde commits horrible crimes in London, and changes back into Dr Jekyll. Eventually, Jekyll turns into Hyde without wishing to, resulting in Jekyll committing suicide. == Themes == The novel is based on the Victorian English idea of pretending to be someone else, and acting a different way around other people to look more respectable.
