 "text": "Jaecoo is a brand of Chinese vehicle manufacturer Chery that debuted in 2023. The brand was established to market SUVs in export markets. Jaecoo vehicles went on sale in 2024 in various markets including Europe, Russia, Malaysia, the Middle East, South Africa, and Chile. == History == In April 2023, the Chinese corporation Chery Automobile officially launched the creation of two sister car brands, which, unlike the other subsidiaries, were created with export markets in mind. Their creation was the result of adopting a strategy in the second decade of the 21st century calculated to achieve annual sales of 1.4 million cars by 2030. In addition to Omoda, Jaecoo also debuted, which was distinguished from the first by a more utilitarian character and conventional styling of the models. The name was created from a combination of the German word \"Jäger\" (hunter) and the English \"cool\" (cool). As in the case of Omoda, the first Jaecoo model was a compact SUV already present on the Chinese market under the parent brand Chery. Jaecoo J7 was created as an export version of Chery Tansuo 06, apart from other logos, it was also distinguished from it by a remodeled radiator grille and bumpers. During the Qatar edition of the Geneva Motor Show in Doha, Jaecoo presented its second product intended to gradually expand its model portfolio in global markets, the Jaecoo J9, again an export version of an existing product - Chery Tiggo 9. The Jaecoo offer was further expanded in mid-2024, when in April the export version of the electric crossover iCar 03 was presented under the name Jaecoo J6. In October 2024, the fourth product was presented, this time without an equivalent in the Chery range - the subcompact crossover Jaecoo J5. ===Market reach=== Although the Jaecoo brand had its global premiere in April 2023, in its first year, the market debut took place in the fall only in individual markets from the CIS region such as Russia or Kazakhstan. The expansion of the global Chery brand intensified in 2024. In February, Jaecoo began sales in Mexico as the first country from the Latin American region, and a month later - to Thailand, the first country in Southeast Asia. In April 2024, Jaecoo also expanded its reach to Africa, starting with the South African market, and also Israel. In July, the Middle East became the next sales region, starting with Saudi Arabia., and in the second half of 2024 Jaecoo began distribution in European markets. It started with Italy, to move to Spain in September, among others or Polish. == Car models == ===Currently produced === The first model of Jaecoo is the J7, a rebadged Chery Tansuo 06, and was followed by the J8 (a rebadged Chery Tiggo 9) in October 2023 at the Geneva Motor Show in Qatar.
