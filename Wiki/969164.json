 "text": "The centre-right coalition () is an alliance of political parties in Italy since 1994, when Silvio Berlusconi entered politics and formed his Forza Italia party. In the 1994 general election, under the leadership of Berlusconi, the centre-right ran with two coalitions, the Pole of Freedoms in northern Italy and Tuscany (mainly Forza Italia and the Northern League) and the Pole of Good Government (mainly Forza Italia and National Alliance) in central and southern Italy. Since 2008, when Forza Italia and National Alliance merged into The People of Freedom, the coalition has not had official names. The new Forza Italia was formed in late 2013; for the 2018 general election. During the 2022 general election, the center-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni won an absolute majority of seats in both chambers of the Italian Parliament. This is the first time the center-right won a general election since 2008. ==References== Category:Political parties in Italy",
