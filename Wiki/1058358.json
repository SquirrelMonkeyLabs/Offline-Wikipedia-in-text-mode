 "text": "The WAGR L class were a total of 20 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1924 to 1958. The L class were the result of significantly rebuilding the Ec class 4-6-2 heavy goods engines with new boilers, cylinders, and valve gear at Midland Railway Workshops. They operated goods services from Northam to Wongan Hills and onto Mullewa, while also running to Meekatharra on the Northern Railway. One-point cylinder lubrication was first trialled on the L class being so successful that it became standard on all WAGR stock from then on. The class became riddled with metal fatigue in the 1930s, having new frames fitted to 14 of the class up until 1948. The L class were displaced by the W class and the last was scrapped around 1965 == Gallery == File:L classes + bagged wheat, Dalwallinu, 1929.jpg|L classes hauling bagged wheat at Dalwallinu in 1929.
