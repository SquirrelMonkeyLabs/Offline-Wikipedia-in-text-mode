 "text": "Coronado was an unincorporated community in Wichita County, Kansas, United States. It was platted in 1885. Coronado was involved in the bloodiest county seat fight in the history of the American West. The shoot-out on February 27, 1887, with boosters--some would say hired gunmen--from nearby Leoti left several people dead and wounded. Coronado had a post office from 1886 until 1899. ==References== *War in Wichita County (see bottom of page) Category:Ghost towns in Kansas",
