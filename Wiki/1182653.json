It offers digital banking services through a mobile app. Revolut was started in July 2015 by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko in London. Storonsky had worked as a trader and Yatsenko was a software engineer. They created Revolut to help people avoid high fees when using money abroad. At first, Revolut offered a Mastercard prepaid card and currency exchange. Later, it added more services like stock trading, cryptocurrency and insurance. Revolut operates in over 48 countries, including the United Kingdom, European Union, United States, Australia, Japan and Brazil. It plans to expand to more places like India and the Middle East. In 2025, Revolut will install its own ATMs in Spain, starting in Madrid and Barcelona. It also offers instant savings accounts for users of its app for young people. The app, called Revolut <18, is made for children between 6 and 17 years old.
