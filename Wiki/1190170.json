 "text": "The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is a planned museum focused on the life and legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States. It is to be built in Medora, North Dakota, near Theodore Roosevelt National Park. A site was picked in March 2020 from eleven candidates on land owned by the U.S. Forest Service, about west of Medora, near the Burning Hills Amphitheater. It is close to the Medora entrance near the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Congress passed legislation to allow and direct the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to sell the land, which was owned by the U.S. Forest Service for this. ==References== Category:Theodore Roosevelt Category:Buildings and structures in North Dakota Category:Presidential libraries",
