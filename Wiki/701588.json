 "text": "Matthew Wade Stairs (born February 27, 1968) is a Canadian former professional baseball outfielder, first baseman, and designated hitter, who holds the record for most pinch-hit home runs in Major League Baseball (MLB) history with 23. His pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning of Game 4 in the 2008 National League Championship Series off the Los Angeles Dodgers reliever Jonathan Broxton was called one of the most memorable home runs in Phillies history. In his career, Stairs played for more teams than any position player in MLB history (12 — technically 13 teams, but 12 franchises, as he played for the Montreal Expos and Washington Nationals); Edwin Jackson holds the record for pitchers and all players at 14. He was the second Canadian-born player ever to hit more than thirty-five home runs in a season, and only the second to hit more than 25 home runs and drive in more than 100 runs in back-to-back seasons. He ranks either first or second in power hitting categories for Canadian major leaguers. Stairs also holds the all-time MLB record of home runs hit as a pinch-hitter with 23. His ability to pinch hit made him a valuable asset to several teams and earned him the nickname \"Matt Stairs – Professional Hitter\". Stairs, Larry Walker, Justin Morneau, Jason Bay, and Joey Votto are the only Canadian MLB players to hit at least 200 career home runs. On February 4, 2015, Stairs was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Canadian baseball players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Montreal Expos players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:San Diego Padres players Category:People from Bangor, Maine Category:Sportspeople from New Brunswick Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Washington Nationals players",
