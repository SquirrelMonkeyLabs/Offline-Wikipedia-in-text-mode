 "text": "Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network to send data packets from a source to a destination. It is essential for communication in Computer Networks, the Internet, and Telecommunication systems. Routers, which are specialized Network Devices, determine the best path for data transmission using algorithms and protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Effective routing ensures efficient data delivery, reducing latency and optimizing network performance. There are various types of routing, including Static Routing, Dynamic Routing, and Default Routing. Static Routing requires manual configuration of fixed paths, making it simple but less adaptable. Dynamic Routing, used in large networks like ISPs (Internet Service Providers), relies on protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) to adjust routes automatically. Default Routing is used when a router forwards packets to a default path when no specific route is known. These routing methods collectively ensure smooth data flow across LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and Cloud Networks. Routing plays a crucial role in modern Cybersecurity, as malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in Network Routing to launch Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, DDoS Attacks, and IP Spoofing. Secure routing protocols, such as IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) and SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), help encrypt data and protect sensitive information. As network infrastructures evolve with advancements in 5G Technology, Edge Computing, and AI-driven Networking, routing strategies continue to improve, ensuring seamless global connectivity. \\---- Category:Networking Category:Internet protocols Category:Computer science",
