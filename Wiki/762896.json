 "text": "Choking happens when breathing is made difficult. It happens when the windpipe is blocked. In some cases the air flow is completely blocked, in other cases some amount of air can pass to the lungs. Insufficient oxygen being delivered to the body and more importantly the brain will result in oxygen deprivation, although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops. Around 4,500 to 5,000 choking-related deaths occur in the United States every year. Deaths from choking most often occur in the very young (children under three years old) and in the elderly (adults over 75 years). ==References== ==Related pages== *Choking agent *Strangulation Category:Medical emergencies",
