 "text": "Vauxhall Bridge is a steel and granite bridge in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a north-west south-east direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Westminster on the north bank. ==History== Vauzhall Bridge in 1906. It replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry. The building of both bridges was difficult, with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane. The present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames. In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames.Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, Key facts ; Londontown.com, \"Thames Jubilee Pageant,\"; retrieved 2012-6-4. ==Related pages == * List of crossings of the River Thames == References == ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * ==Other websites== * Category:Bridges in London Category:Buildings and structures in the City of Westminster Category:Transport in the City of Westminster Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Transport in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Steel bridges Category:Stone bridges",
