This type of composition is very popular in many countries and serves as a collective memory for an entire class of students from a college, a school, a faculty, or another type of entity, whether they are university students or not. == History and use == The origin of end of studies collage dates back to the class photo that were often taken in educational institutions during the 19th century. Over time, the tradition of including individual photos of each student in a decorative format became more common. Student class photos not only have a sentimental value, but also act as a historical archive. These collages allow students and staff to remember the shared moment, as well as identify their peers in the future. Furthermore, these collages are a reflection of the educational environment and the cultural history of the institution. == Creation process == The process for creating a class list generally involves the following steps: * Photo Taking: Students pose for individual photos, usually in front of a neutral background. * Design: Photos are arranged in an attractive format, often accompanied by each student's name and the institution's logo. * Printing and Distribution: The finished end of studies collage is printed on high-quality paper and distributed to students and teaching staff. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Photography Category:Education",
