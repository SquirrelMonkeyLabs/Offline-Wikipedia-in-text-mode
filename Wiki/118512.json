 "text": "The Big Mac is a kind of sandwich, better known as hamburger, sold at the fast food-chain McDonald's. It has 550 calories, and is made using two beef patties, Big Mac Sauce, dehydrated onions, shredded lettuce, sliced pickles, and a slice of cheese. Also, the Big Mac Index is measured in how much a Big Mac costs in foreign currencies. It is the most popular item in McDonald's menu. == History == The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, one of Ray Kroc's earliest franchisees, who was the owner of some restaurants in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. It was designed to compete with a similar Big Boy sandwich. Customer response to the Big Mac was so good that it was begun to be made nationally in 1967. One of its well-known and unique features is a middle slice of bread (\"club\" layer) used to make sure the contents do not move about and to prevent spills. == McDonaldland character == === Officer Big Mac === Officer Big Mac is a character from McDonaldland, a fictional universe made by McDonald's for its ads. He came out in 1971. He looks like Mayor McCheese, the mayor of McDonaldland. As the chief of police, he's in charge of keeping order and stopping the Hamburglar from stealing hamburgers. ==Other names== Originally, the Big Mac had two different names that didn't do well in the market: the Aristocrat and Blue Ribbon Burger. The third name, Big Mac, was suggested by Esther Glickstein Rose, a 21-year-old secretary at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois. == References == ==Other websites== *Big Mac at mcdonalds.com *Canadian Website Category:McDonald's foods Category:Hamburgers",
