 "text": "Rivero's poison frog (Mannophryne riveroi) is a frog. It lives in the Cerro Azul on the Península de Paria in Sucre, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams in cloud forests on hills and mountains. Scientists saw the frog between 400 and 1000 meters above sea level. There is one protected place near where the frog lives, Península de Paria National Park, but scientists are not sure if the frog lives in this park. ==Young== The male frog sits on rocks and calls to the female frogs. Scientists are not sure how this frog make young, but they believe it does the same things as other frogs in Aromobatidae: The male frogs carry the tadpoles to water after the eggs hatch. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People change the forests where it lives to make small farms and get wood to build with. Scientists think the disease chytridiomycosis could hurt this frog, but they have not found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on the frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
