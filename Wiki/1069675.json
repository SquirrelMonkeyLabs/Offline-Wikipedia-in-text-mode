Some of its smaller rivers that join it are the Duncan River and Jerry River. The Gorge River goes through Cascade Forest and reaches the Tasman Sea about 15 km northeast of Awarua Point. There are tiny islands called the Gorge Islands near its mouth. The river is fast and affected by tides at its delta. == Related pages == * Waikato River * List of rivers of New Zealand == References == Category:Rivers of New Zealand Category:West Coast Region",
