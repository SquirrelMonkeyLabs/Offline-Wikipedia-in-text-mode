 "text": "Scott Island In the Ross Sea Southern Oceanhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00288306.1982.10421508, 505 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Cape Adare, the northeastern tip of Victoria Land, Antarctica, lies a small island. It measures 565 meters (618 yards) in length from north to south and varies in width from 130 meters (140 yards) to 340 meters (370 yards), reaching a height of 54 meters (177 feet) and covering an area of 4 hectares (9.9 acres). The Hagits Pillar, a stack reaching 62 meters (203 feet) in height and 50 meters (55 yards) in diameter, resulting in an area of less than 0.2 hectares (0.5 acres), is located 250 meters (270 yards) west of the island. The island has two small coves with beaches, surrounded by steep cliffs on the rest of the island. One cove is located on the northeastern coast, and the other is opposite the Hagits Pillar on the western coast of the island. == Features == A notable feature of Scott Island is the Hagits Pillar, a rock stack located 250 meters (820 feet) west of the island. The pillar stands at a height of 62 meters (203 feet) and has a diameter of 50 meters (164 feet). == Climate == The climate of Scott Island is polar, with strong winds, low temperatures, and limited sunlight during the winter months. The island is surrounded by sea ice for much of the year, and the surrounding waters are home to a variety of marine life. == Research and Exploration == Scott Island has been the subject of scientific research and exploration, with studies focusing on the island's geology, wildlife, and climate. The island's remote location and unique environment make it an important site for researchers seeking to understand the natural systems of Antarctica. ==External links== *Birds observed at Scott Island, Ross Sea, Antarctica *Gerhard Wörner and Giovanni Orsi (1990).
