The show ran for three seasons on ABC from 1959–1962, for a total of 91 episodes.

The family returned to the United States shortly before the outbreak of World War II; McKay and his older brother, Hugh, lived with grandparents in Lexington, Kentucky. McKay impressed Dore Schary, who signed him to a contract with MGM. For that studio he appeared in episodes of The Thin Man and appeared in the film Raintree County, with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. The movie was partly filmed in Kentucky. McKay settled in Hawaii, where he died from prostate cancer in 2001 at the age of 69. He was survived by his wife Madeleine Madigan, a painter, and two children. McKay is buried in Brooks, Kentucky. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1932 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors",
