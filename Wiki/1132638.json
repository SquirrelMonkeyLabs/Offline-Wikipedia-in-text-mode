 "text": "Corruption in Malaysia involves dishonest actions by people in power, such as politicians or officials, who use their positions for personal gain. This can include bribery, embezzlement, and favoritism. Corruption affects many areas, like business, politics, and public services. It undermines trust in the government and can slow down economic development. The Malaysian government has taken steps to combat corruption, but it remains a significant issue. In March 2016, Time Magazine highlighted Malaysia for its corruption scandals. It focused on the 1MDB scandal and Prime Minister Najib Razak's involvement. After the 2018 general election, the new Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, led the government in fighting corruption. On 28 July 2020, Najib was found guilty of seven charges related to the 1MDB scandal, including abuse of power and money laundering. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison and fined RM210 million. The sentence was upheld by the Federal Court on 23 August 2022, and he is now serving his time in Kajang Prison. ==References== Category:Politics of Malaysia",
