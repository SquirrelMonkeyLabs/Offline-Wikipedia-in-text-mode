 "text": "A creampie is a term used in pornography. It is when a person's penis ejaculates semen inside their partner's vagina or anus and the semen leaks out, looking like the cream filling of a pie. Creampies are risky because they can result in unwanted pregnancy (vaginal, if the receiving partner is not using contraception) or transmission of STDs (vaginal or anal). ==References gw== Category:Pornography Category:Sexual acts",
