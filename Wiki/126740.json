 "text": "Scarborough is a town on the North Sea coast of North Yorkshire, England. According to an Icelandic Saga, it was founded by the Vikings around 966AD. There are remains of Roman, Stone Age and Bronze Age settlements, so it was obviously a natural place to put a settlement. With a population of around 50,000, Scarborough is the largest holiday resort on the Yorkshire coast. Yorkshire County Cricket Club's second ground is at North Marine Road. Local news and information is provided by the towns radio station Yorkshire Coast Radio. Scarborough Athletic FC is the football team in the coastal resort. The team is managed by Manchester United treble winner and former West Brom captain Jono Greening. == Transport links == === Rail === The town is served by Scarborough railway station. ===Roads=== Scarborough has four major roads serving the town; these also link it to other major towns and cities. *A64 – Main road that terminates in the town centre, linking Scarborough with Malton, York, Leeds, the A19 and the A1(M). This is the main tourist route to the town and is dual carriageway standard for most of its route (between the A1(M) and Malton). *A165 – This is the coastal route that links the town with Filey, Bridlington and Hull. In 2008, a new road was opened to bypass Osgodby to the south of Scarborough. This now forms part of the A165. *A170 – This links Scarborough to the North York Moors and Thirsk to the west. *A171 – This is the coastal route to the north that links the town with Whitby and Middlesbrough. These roads can be got to from the M1 motorway, which runs from London to Scotland through the middle of Yorkshire. == Leisure == The town has fine arts and recreational facilities. Two theatres and two cinemas are popular. There are several museums: Woodend for art, The Rotunda for geology, Scarborough Art Gallery for the fine arts. The Grade II listed Scarborough Spa complex is home to the Scarborough Spa Orchestra, the last remaining seaside orchestra in the UK. == Fishing == Scarborough's fishing industry is still active, though reduced in size. The working harbour is home to a fish market with a shop and wooden stalls. Fresh, locally-caught seafood can be bought by the public. A seaweed farm has been in operation since 2018. ==References==",
