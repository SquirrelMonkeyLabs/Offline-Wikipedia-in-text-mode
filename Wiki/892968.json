 "text": "The World Set Free is a 1913 science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. It was published in 1914. The book is based on a prediction of a more destructive weapon than the world has yet seen. It had appeared first in serialised form with a different ending as A Prophetic Trilogy. That form was made up of three books: A Trap to Catch the Sun, The Last War in the World and The World Set Free. The novel tells the story of manâ€™ using the (at that time) newly- discovered power of the atom. It tells how this power almost destroys civilisation in a war. In a sense, the book seems to have ended up being a self-fulfilling prophecy. The World Set Free is an example of how science and science fiction can work together and build upon each other. category:1914 books category:science fiction books category:books by H. G. Wells",
