 "text": "Speyer (English formerly Spires) is a city in the state of Rhineland- Palatinate with about 50,000 inhabitants on the Rhine river. It lies south of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim. Around the year 500 the town gets the name Spira, named after the stream Speyerbach which flows into the Rhine river here. The center of Speyer is dominated by the Speyer Cathedral. Here are the tombs of several of the Salian emperors: the bodies, however, are believed to have gone missing during one of the French invasions during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. == Photo gallery == Speyer-Dom-15-Westwerk- Maximilianstr-gje.jpg|Cathedral Speyer-Dom-50-Seitenschiff-gje.jpg|Cathedral inside Speyer-Dom-vom Suedwestturm-06-Maximilianstr-gje.jpg|View from the tower of the cathedral Speyer-28-Korngasse-Altpoertel-gje.jpg|Old city gate Speyer-44-Maximilianstr-Stadthaus-gje.jpg|City hall Speyer-10-Gedaechtniskirche-gje.jpg|Memorial church Speyer-12-Josephskirche- gje.jpg|Church of St. Joseph ==References== == Other websites == *speyer.de the city website (partly in English) *museum.speyer.de Historical Museum of the Palatinate (in English) *dom-speyer.de website of Speyer Cathedral (in German) *Model Map of Medieval Speyer *Technical (Transport) Museum Category:1290s establishments in Europe Category:13th-century establishments in Germany Category:1790s disestablishments in Europe Category:Disestablishments in Germany",
