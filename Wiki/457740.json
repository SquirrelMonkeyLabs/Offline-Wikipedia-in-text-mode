Her male counterpart doesn't care about the situation and gives Katy the luggage while taking selfies . A tiger acts him suddenly . Katy screams and flees with the tiger chasing after her she ditches the tiger and is nearly eaten by a crocodile and has a spider crawl on her . After this Katy sees fireflies in the bushes who all come out and form a tiger . It cuts to the next shot wear she bathes with help from an elephant and makes. friends with a money. She also turns berries into lipstick and uses her shoe to make a hunting tool . She catches a banana and then goes exploring .She reads prehistoric cave art with a tiger's roar being stronger than men . He then emerges in different clothes and a leaf skirt and starts swing from vines and brushes a crocodiles teeth and also she paints an elephant's toe nails . She calls all the animals and uses a parrots feather to lure the tiger into a trap and proves her roar stronger than his . Katy is then named queen of the jungle with her tiger and various animals as her pets . The next shot cuts to her waking up in the crashed plane surrounded by animals. ==Credits and Personnel== Credits adapted from Prism album liner notes. * Katy Perry – vocals and songwriting * Bonnie McKee – lyrics * Dr. Luke – songwriting and production * Max Martin – songwriting and production * Cirkut – songwriting and production * Michael Ilbert – recording * Sam Holland – recording * Peter Carlsson – recording * Clint Gibbs – recording * Elliott Lanam – recording assistant * Justin Fox – recording assistant * Rachael Findlen – recording assistant * John Hanes – mixing * Serban Ghenea – mixing * Chris Gehringer – mastering * Irene Richter – production coordinator ==Awards and nominations== Year Organization Award Result Ref. 2014 NRJ Music Awards Favourite International Song ASCAP Pop Music Awards Most Performed Song Billboard Music Awards Top Hot 100 Song Billboard Music Awards Top Digital Song Billboard Music Awards Top Radio Song Billboard Music Awards Top Streaming Song (Video) BMI Awards Award Winning Song Grammy Awards Song of the Year Grammy Awards Best Pop Solo Performance MTV Video Music Awards Japan Video of the Year MTV Video Music Awards Japan Best Female Video Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards Favourite Song People's Choice Awards Favorite Song People's Choice Awards Favorite Music Video Premios Juventud Favourite Song Not In Spanish Radio Disney Music Awards Song of the Year ==References== ==Other websites== * Lyric video on Vevo * * Category:Katy Perry songs Category:2013 songs Category:Pop songs Category:Songs with feminist themes",
