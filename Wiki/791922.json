 "text": "Pearson's green tree frog, Pearson's tree frog, the mountain stream tree frog, cascade tree frog or Cedar Creek tree frog (Ranoidea pearsoniana) is a frog from Australia. It lives in Queensland and New South Wales, from 200 to 1000 metres above sea level. This frog lives in forests where the trees are close together. It lives in fast-flowing streams in the forest. It hides under rocks during the day and looks for food at night. The females lay eggs in pools where the water does not flow fast, 360-730 at a time. The eggs stick to the undersides of rocks or to plants or to the bottom of the pool. The tadpoles become frogs after 2 to 2.5 months. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
