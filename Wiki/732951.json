 "text": "Globe Town is an area southeast of Bethnal Green in East London. It is in the borough of Tower Hamlets, in London, United Kingdom. Globe Town can be described as being east of the rest of Bethnal Green. It features a parade of shops, several social housing estates (primarily high-rise) and Bow Post office. Large metal statues of globes were built as part of a Tower Hamlets council scheme known as \"Tower Hamlets' Neighbourhoods\", trying to build a sense of community in poorer areas of London's East End. The area centres on Roman Road, providing access to neighbouring Bethnal Green and Bow, with many bus routes between these bigger neighbourhoods stopping in Globe Town. South of the main area are a primary school and pedestrian and cycle access towards Queen Mary University Of London. == References == Category:Bethnal Green",
