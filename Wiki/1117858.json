Before starting his company, Lewin was a member of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and was able to make it to the rank of captain. He would go on to work for IBM and then start Akamai Technologies with F. Thomson Leighton while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Lewin is said to have been the first victim of the September 11 attacks. Lewin was aboard American Airlines Flight 11 to head to a business meeting in Los Angeles. When the terrorists hijacked the plane, it is reported that Lewin got up to try and stop them but had his throat slashed by Satam al-Suqami, a hijacker that was sitting behind him. His name is on the the South Pool, on Panel N-75 at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. In 2017, Lewin was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame. ==References== Category:1970 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American computer scientists Category:American Jews Category:Businesspeople from Denver Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Naturalized citizens of Israel Category:People from Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:People murdered in New York (state) Category:September 11 attacks",
