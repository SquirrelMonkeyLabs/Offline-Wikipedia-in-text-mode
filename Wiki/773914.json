 "text": "The Crimean Tatar language (which is often simply called Crimean) is spoken by Crimean Tatars who live mostly in the Crimean peninsula. It is one of the Kipchak languages, (which are also called Northwestern Turkic languages), and is unrelated to the Tatar language: Speakers of one language cannot understand people who speak the other. There are about 500,000 native speakers of Crimean. About half of them live on the Crimean peninsula, about 200,000 in Uzbekistan, about 30,000 in Russia, 2,500 in Romania and 600 in Bulgaria. == References == Category:Turkic languages Category:Languages of Russia Category:Languages of Ukraine Category:Languages of Turkey Category:Languages of Uzbekistan Category:Languages of Romania Category:Languages of Kyrgyzstan Category:Bulgaria Category:Lithuania",
