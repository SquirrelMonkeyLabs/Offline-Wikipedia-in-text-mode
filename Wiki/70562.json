 "text": "The Avalon Peninsula is a large peninsula (9,270 km²) that makes up the southeast portion of the island of Newfoundland. The peninsula is home to forty percent of Newfoundland's population, and is the location of the provincial capital, St. John's. It is connected to the main section of the island by the 5 km/3 mile wide Isthmus of Avalon. The peninsula sticks out into the rich fishing zones near the Grand Banks. Its four major bays–Trinity Bay, Conception Bay, St. Mary's Bay, and Placentia Bay–have long been the center of Newfoundland's fishing industry. ==Related pages== * British colonization of the Americas * Conception Bay * Newfoundland and Labrador ==Other websites== *Heritage of Newfoundland - Colony of Avalon Category:Geography of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Peninsulas of Canada",
