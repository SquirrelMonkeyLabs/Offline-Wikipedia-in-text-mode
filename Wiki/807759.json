 "text": "The Taipei frog also referred to as Taipeh frog, Taipei grass frog, two- striped grass frog, striped slender frog, Taipei slender frog, Taipeh slender frog, white-banded frog, Taiwanese frog or stripe-backed frog (Hylarana taipehensis) is a frog from China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. People have seen this frog as high as 800 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== The adult frog is 40 mm long from nose to rear end. It is bright yellow, green, brown, or mixed in color with some dark brown on the sides of its head. During the day, this frog stays where the trees are close to each other. It can live near humans, on farms and in cities. ==Threats== Scientists do not think this frog is in danger of dying out right now, but there are fewer of them than there were. Scientists think it would be bad for the frog if human beings changed the place where they live too much. Chemicals that make farm plants grow, chemical poisons that kill pests, and pollution can all kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
