 "text": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) are males that perform sexual acts on other males. They may be homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual. The term MSM was created during the early 1990s. MSM is used in the medical literature and social research to describe such males as a group for research studies. Men having sex with other men have an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), especially if they don't use a condom. The diseases include HIV, AIDS and herpes. In the United States, males who have sex with other males in and after 1977 have an HIV rate almost 60 times higher than the general population. Even with a condom, anal sex is risky. ==References== Category:LGBT",
