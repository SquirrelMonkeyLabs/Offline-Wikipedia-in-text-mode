Its back is green-brown with yellow-green stripes going from front to back. Its head is larger than its body. This frog lives in the edges of forests with bodies of water in them, for examples springs, ponds, and streams. They also live in open places that are near forests. When the scientists caught the frogs, they were sitting on small, woody plants. Scientists named this frog after a scientist: Dr. Flora Acuña Juncá.
