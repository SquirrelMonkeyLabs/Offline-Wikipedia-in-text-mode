 "text": "The Sculptor Group is a loose group of galaxies. It is visible near the south galactic pole. The group is one of the nearest groups of galaxies to the Local Group; the distance to the center of the Sculptor Group from the Milky Way is about 12.7 million light years. The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253) and a few other galaxies form a gravitationally-bound core in the center of this group. A few other galaxies at the edges may be connected with the group but may not be gravitationally bound. Because most of the galaxies in this group are actually weakly gravitationally bound, the group may also be described as a filament. It is believed to be at an early stage of evolution in which galaxies are still falling into the group along filamentary structures. == References == Category:Galaxies",
