This is usually used to store multiple passwords as a person may forget some passwords. People store many passwords for different services as it is not safe to only use one password as if someone else knows the passwords of one of their items, they know the passwords of their other things too since they all have the same password. Recently they have been used to stored other things such as credit card numbers, security questions, One-Time Passwords, and account recovery questions. To access the items in the password manager the person usually has to remember one password, if they lose this password, then they will usually not be able to access the data in their password manager.
