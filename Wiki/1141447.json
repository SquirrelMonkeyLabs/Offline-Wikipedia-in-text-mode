 "text": "The Santa Rita rocket frog (Leucostethus fraterdanieli) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. Scientists have seen it in wet places, sitting on the dead leaves on the ground. They saw it in cloud forests and other tropical forests. Sometimes they find the frogs on farms that have streams nearby. People have seen this frog between 650 and 2750 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Parque Nacional Natural Farallones de Cali, Santuario de Flora y Fauna Ot√∫n Quimbaya, and Reserva Costa Rica. ==Young== Scientists think this frog lays eggs at any time of year. The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. The male frog watches the eggs until they hatch. Then the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. Scientists saw male frogs carrying 10 or 11 tadpoles at one time. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because so many of them are alive. The frog is in some danger because people cut down trees to make farms, make places for animals to eat grass, and get wood to build with. Bad chemicals from farms can also hurt this frog. Scientists found some frogs that had the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. B. dendrobatidis causes the disease chytridiomycosis, which kills frogs. But scientists do not know if this frog is in danger from this. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
