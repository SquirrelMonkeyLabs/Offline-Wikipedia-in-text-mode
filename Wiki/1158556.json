Their convictions were later ruled unfair and reversed by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991. The six men were later given financial compensation ranging from £840,000 to £1.2 million. ==The Birmingham Six== Six men were arrested: Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Joseph Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker. Five were Belfast-born, while John Walker was born in Derry. All six had lived in Birmingham since the 1960s.
