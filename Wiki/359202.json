It features Spyro, a small, purple dragon; his dragonfly companion, Sparx; and a multitude of fellow dragons. It takes place in the Dragon Realms, an imaginary fantasy world, which is itself divided in six worlds: Artisans, Peace Keepers, Magic Crafters, Beast Makers, Dream Weavers, and Gnasty's World. At the beginning of the game the main antagonist, Gnasty Gnorc (a half gnome, half orc hybrid), seeks revenge against the dragons for banishing him and traps them in stone. Spyro was out playing hooky and was spared from a crystal prison. The point of the game is to charge, fly, and flame your way through each world, defeating enemies, saving dragons, and eventually facing and taking down Gnasty. Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! is the sequel to Spyro the Dragon. It was released on the Playstation in 1999.

Spyro was looking forward to having some rest but instead is dragged into a new adventure. In this episode of the series, the small dragon also meets a number of new allies, including the Professor, Hunter the cheetah, Elora the fawn, and Zoe the fairy, and must face Ripto and his henchmen, Crush and Gulp, two other dinosaurs who are not very smart.
