It covers much of the southern half of Missouri and a large portion of northwestern and north-central Arkansas. The region also goes westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastrn Kansas. The name comes from the French Aux Arcs. The name means \"with bows\" and was given by an early French explorer to the Bow Indians (Quapaw), who were native to the area that later became Arkansas. == References == Category:Regions of Oklahoma Category:Regions of Kansas",
