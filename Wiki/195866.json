 "text": "Rochester New York FC (RNYFC or RNY) is a soccer club based in Rochester, New York, United States. After a hiatus of four seasons, the club resumed play in 2022 as a member of MLS Next Pro, a newly formed league in the third level of U.S. soccer. The league is operated by Major League Soccer and mainly houses MLS reserve sides (made up of younger players developing their skills). RNYFC is the only team in the league that is not owned and operated by an MLS side. RNYFC was founded in 1996 as the Rochester Raging Rhinos, dropping the word \"Raging\" in 2008. The club has played in lower-level U.S. leagues throughout its history, mostly at the second level. Before going on hiatus after the 2017 season, it played in the current second level, the USL Championship. Notably, it has been the only team outside MLS to have won the U.S. Open Cup since MLS was formed in 1996, winning that competition in 1999. A year before the club's hiatus, David and Wendy Dworkin, minority owners of the NBA's Sacramento Kings, became the Rhinos' owners. During the hiatus, the club sought a new stadium site and added funding. In June 2021, English Premier League star Jamie Vardy bought a minority stake in the club. That September, the club renamed itself Rochester New York FC, and soon announced that it would join MLS Next Pro. For at least the 2022 season, RNY will play at John L. DiMarco Field at Monroe Community College in the suburb of Brighton. == Name == * 1997-2007 Rochester Raging Rhinos * 2008–2021 Rochester Rhinos * 2021–present Rochester New York FC Category:American soccer teams Category:Rochester, New York Category:1996 establishments in New York (state)",
