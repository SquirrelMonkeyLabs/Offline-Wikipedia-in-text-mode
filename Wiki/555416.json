In the United States Emma Lazarus wrote some poems using ababbcc rhyme-scheme. This stanza comes form her poem Sympathy (included in Epochs). : It comes not in such wise as she had deemed, : Else might she still have clung to her despair. : More tender, grateful than she could have dreamed, : Fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair, : And gentle words borne softly through the air, : Calming her weary sense and wildered mind, : By welcome, dear communion with her kind. Poets who wrote rhyme royal frequently were William Morris and John Masefield. In 20th century the stanza went out of use. == References == == Bibliography == * Joseph Berg Esenwein, Mary Eleanor Roberts, Art of Versification. Revised edition. Springfield: 1920.
