 "text": "Glenrothes is a town in the middle of Fife, a part of east-central Scotland. In 2011, 39,277 people lived there, making it the third biggest town in Fife and the 18th biggest in Scotland. It is the main town for running Fife's local government, with offices for Fife Council and Police Scotland. It is also an important place for local services. The town was planned in the 1940s after World War II to help grow the economy in Fife. It was built to provide houses, jobs, roads, and services for a large coal mine called Rothes Colliery.Ferguson, 1996, p. 7 The mine closed early, so the town found new ways to grow. It became important for industry and helped make Scotland's Silicon Glen, a center for technology, between 1961 and 2000.Ferguson, 1996, pp. 24-32 The name Glenrothes comes from the Earl of Rothes, who owned the land. \"Glen\" means valley, added to avoid confusion with another place called Rothes and because the town is in a valley. Glenrothes' motto is Ex terra vis, meaning \"From the Earth Comes Life.\" Glenrothes has won many awards for its parks and gardens. It also has many outdoor artworks created by town artists when the town was built. The town is a top place for making electronics and other high-tech products. Big companies like Bosch Rexroth, Leviton, Raytheon, and Fife College are based there. The Kingdom Shopping Centre, the largest in Fife, is at the town's heart, with most shopping inside one place. Other public places include a sports centre, two golf courses, big parks, a civic centre, a theatre, and a college campus. The A92 road connects Glenrothes to Scotland's big road network. The town has a large bus station for local and regional buses. There are also train stations near the town at Markinch and Thornton, linking it to the Edinburgh-Dundee and Fife Circle rail lines. == References == === Citations === Category:Scotland",
