 "text": "The common tree frog, six-lined tree frog, Terei tree frog, Teraiensis whipping frog, or perching frog (Polypedates teraiensis) is a frog. It lives in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal, and scientists think it could also livein China. People have seen it between 40 and 1800 meters above sea level. This frog lives in many kinds of places, including tree farms, forests, and paddy fields. The female frog makes a nest out of foam on a plant over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
