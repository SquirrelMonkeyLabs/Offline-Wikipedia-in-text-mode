After the war, he briefly supported Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. He was not found guilty for his role in the Nazis' unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch. He became disillusioned with politics and retired from public life that year. == Other websites == * Erich Ludendorff Firstworldwar.com Who's Who * Ludendorff by H. L.
