 "text": "The Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy refers to the dispute over the development of calculus in the late 17th century, primarily between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Both mathematicians independently developed calculus, but their approaches and notations differed significantly. Newton focused on the concept of \"fluxions\" and used geometric methods, while Leibniz introduced a more systematic notation, including the integral and differential symbols. The controversy escalated after Leibniz published his work in 1684, leading to accusations of plagiarism from supporters of Newton. The Royal Society, led by Newton, sided with him, further polarizing the mathematical community. The dispute had lasting implications for the fields of mathematics and science, influencing how calculus was taught and perceived. Despite the conflict, both mathematicians are now recognized for their foundational contributions to calculus, and modern calculus incorporates elements from both their works.
