 "text": "Gustavo Adolfo Domínguez Bastida, better known as Bécquer, (Seville, 17 February 1836 – Madrid, 22 December 1870) was a Spanish post-romanticist writer of poetry and short stories. He is considered one of the most important figures in Spanish literature. He adopted the alias of Bécquer as his brother Valeriano Bécquer, a painter, had done earlier. He was associated with the post-romanticism movement and wrote while realism in literature was enjoying success in Spain. He was moderately well known during his life, but it was after his death that most of his works were published. His best known works are the Rhymes and the Legends, usually published together as Rimas y leyendas. These poems and tales are essential to the study of Spanish literature and common reading for high-school students in Spanish-speaking countries. His work approached the traditional poetry and themes in a modern way, and is considered the founder of modern Spanish lyricism.
