 "text": "In geometry, perimeter is the distance around a flat object. For example, all four sides of a square rhombus have the same length, so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches (2+2+2+2=8). For a polygon, the perimeter is simply the sum of the length of all of its sides. For a rectangle, the perimeter is twice the sum of its length and width (P=2 \\ell + 2w). Perimeter can also be calculated for other planar figures, such as circle, sector and ellipse. Real-life objects have perimeters as well. A football field, including the end zones, is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide. This means that the perimeter of the field is 360+160+360+160=1040 feet. The perimeter of a circle is usually called the circumference. It may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times \"Pi\". Pi is a constant which is approximately equal to 3.14159; however, the places to the right of the decimal are endless. The number of places used depends on the accuracy required for the result. == Related pages == * Area == References == Category:Geometry",
