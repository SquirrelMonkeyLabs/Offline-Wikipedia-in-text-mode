 "text": "Dancing molecules are moving molecules used in experimental therapy to reverse paralysis and repair tissue after severe spinal cord injuries. Nanoparticles are injected into a victim's body near the spinal cord. This was done with paralyzed mice. The mice could walk again within four weeks. ==Mechanism== The therapy works by sending bioactive signals that stimulate cells to repair and regenerate. Since the receptors in neurons are constantly moving, therapy molecules that also move are used. The therapy works in the following ways: # \"The severed extensions of neurons, called axons, regenerated; # Scar tissue, which can create a physical barrier to regeneration and repair, significantly diminished; # Myelin, the insulating layer of axons that is important in transmitting electrical signals efficiently, reformed around cells; # Functional blood vessels formed to deliver nutrients to cells at the injury site; and (5) more motor neurons survived.\" The research was led by Dr. Samuel I. Stupp at Northwestern University. \"The secret behind Stupp's new breakthrough therapeutic is tuning the motion of molecules, so they can find and properly engage constantly moving cellular receptors. Injected as a liquid, the therapy immediately gels into a complex network of nanofibers that mimic the extracellular matrix of the spinal cord. By matching the matrix's structure, mimicking the motion of biological molecules and incorporating signals for receptors, the synthetic materials are able to communicate with cells.\" Northwestern University. \"‘Dancing molecules’ successfully repair severe spinal cord injuries: After single injection, paralyzed animals regained ability to walk within four weeks.\"Northwestern University. \"‘Dancing molecules’ successfully repair severe spinal cord injuries: After single injection, paralyzed animals regained ability to walk within four weeks.\" ScienceDaily.

Dr. Stupp has speculated that the therapy could be applicable to many other areas of nerve problems.
