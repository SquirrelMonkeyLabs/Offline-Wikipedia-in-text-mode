 "text": "Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (19 February 1594 â€“ 6 November 1612) was the oldest son of King James I & VI and of Anne of Denmark. His name comes from his grandfathers, both Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and Frederick II of Denmark. Prince Henry was widely seen as a bright heir to his father's throne. However, he died before his father because of typhoid fever. That made the English and the Scottish thrones go to his younger brother Charles, after James's death.. Several places in Virginia Colony were named after Prince Henry before and after his death. ==Early life== Henry Frederick was born at Stirling Castle and became Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland when he was born. His father, King James, made Alexander Erskine, Earl of Mar, take care of him amd did not let his mother, Anne of Denmark, take care of him. James worried that Anne's slight liking for Catholicism would have some effect on the son. Although that cause many argments between Anne and James, Henry was kept under the care of Mar's family until 1603. James then became King of England, and his family moved south.Fritze, Ronald H. and William B.
