Polanski's third and current wife is actress Emmanuelle Seigner, who is the mother of his daughter and son. == Arrest == In 1977, Polanski got in trouble with the law in California when he was caught having sex with a 13-year-old girl called Samantha Gailey (now Geimer). Polanski went to France. In the 1990s, Polanski paid an undisclosed sum of money to the woman, in exchange for her dropping the charges. He was arrested in Switzerland in September 2009. He was arrested at the request of the United States, so Switzerland could extradite him to the United States. On July 12, 2010, the Swiss freed Polanski, and decided not to extradite him to Los Angeles. The Swiss Justice Ministry did not believe the legal strength of the United States extradition request. According to the press release, the Swiss authorities asked for copies of the proceedings that would justify the extradition. :\"The request (..) was rejected by the US Justice Department on 13 May 2010. In the circumstances, it was not possible to exclude with the necessary certainty that Roman Polanski had not already served the sentence imposed at the time and as a result, the extradition request was seriously flawed. Given the persistent doubts as to the precise facts of the case, the request had to be rejected.\" Polanski is still a fugitive (wanted by the police) in America. However, Geimer has said \"I would love to see him resolve it, the sooner, the better...if we could just put this to rest, that would be great\".p180 Polanski apologized to Geimer in a film documentary. Bernard Kouchner, a French public official, has denounced the USA's extradition request as \"sinister\" because it came so long after the event.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071201129.html ==Movies== * Knife in the Water (1962) p21 * Repulsion (1965) p40 * Cul-de-Sac (1966).p53 * The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967).p58/62 * Rosemary's Baby (1968).p64 * Macbeth (1971).Bate, Jonath & Eric Rasmussen (eds) Macbeth by William Shakespeare.
