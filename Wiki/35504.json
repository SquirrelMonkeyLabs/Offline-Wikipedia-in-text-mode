 "text": "Lake Tahoe or Tahoe is a fresh water lake in the Sierra Nevada. It is on the borders of the states of California and Nevada, in the United States of America. Lake Tahoe is one of the deepest (1645 feet/501 m), largest (192 sq. mi./497 kmÂ²), and highest elevation (6229 feet/1898 m) lakes in the United States. Of the lakes in the United States, only Oregon's Crater Lake is deeper at 1930 feet (588 m). Some visitors experience altitude sickness, because there is less oxygen in the air at higher altitudes. To fight this, experts recommend avoiding heavy exercise or drinking alcohol until the body adjusts to the lower oxygen level. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Lakes of California Category:Geography of Nevada Category:Western United States Category:El Dorado County, California Category:Placer County, California",
