He also fought Ainbcellach, his brother and contestant for the throne, at Finnglen in 719, and was victorious. However, then he was defeated by Dúnchad Bec (Duncan the Small, a ruler from Kintyre), another rival, the same year. Selbach died in 730, three years after fighting his son's great enemy Eochaid mac Echdach. Category:Dalriadan kings",
