 "text": "A handjob is the sexual stimulation of a penis by another person's hands. It is similar to male masturbation but is done by someone else instead of by one's self. It is usually done by lightly grabbing the middle of the penis with one hand and while grabbing slightly above from the middle towards the testicles, repeatedly stroking the penis until the male reaches orgasm. Stimulation of the scrotum may also be accompanied, such as placing both the index and rude finger against the males testicles then placing your little finger on the tip of his foreskin. It is like fingering which is the sexual stimulation of a female's vulva using the fingers. Handjobs are very common in sexual intercourse (the act of breeding two humans or animals together to form life). Category:Sexual acts Category:Sexual slang",
