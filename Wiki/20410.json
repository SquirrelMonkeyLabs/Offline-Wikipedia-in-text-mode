The main character is Archie Bunker. The show deals with many controversial issues (including abortion and racism). The sitcom was created by Norman Lear and it was developed by Lear and Bud Yorkin. It is based on the British sitcom Till Death Us Do Part which was made by Johnny Speight. Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Sally Struthers, Rob Reiner, and Danielle Brisebois are the main actors on the show. All in the Family is seen in the United States of America as one of the greatest television programs in history. The show did not do good in the first season but a lot more people watched when CBS put in the summer reruns on television. Many people liked that the show talked about controversial issues. The show got number 1 on the Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976. It was the first television show to do this. The episode \"Sammy Visit's\" was number 13 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time and TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time had All in the Family as the fourth greatest show of all time. Bravo put Archie Bunker as the \"greatest character of all time.\" All in the Family had seven spin-off shows made. That is the most spin-off shows from any show ever. The show ended on April 8, 1979 but the spin-off show called Archie Bunker's Place started on September 23, 1979 and carried on with Archie Bunker until 1984. 15 years later Norman Lear created 704 Hauser which was about a new family living in Archie Bunker's house after he sold it. The show was ended early after five episodes were put on television. ==Plot== All in the Family is about a family who lives during the early 1970s in the suburbs of Queens, New York City. The sitcom's main character is a World War II veteran and blue-collar worker Archie Bunker. Archie Bunker is old, a bigot, and is not very smart. He gets mad at the changes he sees in the world and wants to go back to when life was more easier. Archie does not like the Democratic Party and is a Republican. He stereotypes every person he meets. His wife, Edith Bunker is a nice woman but she is not very smart. She has a very big family but her family does not like Archie Bunker. Archie and Edith have one child. They have a daughter named Gloria Stivic who is a feminist. Archie calls Gloria \"little girl\". Gloria is married to Michael Stivic who is unemployed and is of Polish descent. Archie calls Michael the \"Meathead\" because Michael has different ideas about politics then Archie. Michael and Gloria have a son together. Archie thinks that Michael is dead from his neck to his head. Archie does not like the Jeffersons who are the African American family that live next door to them. Archie argues with George Jefferson many times but George's wife is a friends with Edith. Her name is Louise Jefferson. George and Louise have a son named Lionel Jefferson who helps out Archie. The Jeffersons move away and into the city. Edith also has a cousin named Maude Findlay who takes care of the Bunkers when they get sick. Archie argues with Maude many times because they do not have the same opinions about politics. The characters who live around Archie and his family are meant to show the changing demographics in the world, which Archie does not like. ===Early seasons of the show=== During the show the family goes through different situations. Many of the most funny moments of the show are in the first season. Early in the show, Michael wrote an angry letter to President Richard Nixon and Archie wrote a letter to Richard Nixon about why he liked him. Archie and the Jeffersons argue over the color of God's skin because he does not think God is black. But Archie gets drunk and is locked in the basement and he thinks that God came to rescue him but it was just one of the Jeffersons. He is surprised that God is black and bows down to him. In many of the episodes Michael and Archie argue. One time Archie was nearly arrested for owning tear gas and another time he went missing. Archie and the people he works with go on strike and Archie does not have a job. But Edith gets a job instead because the family needs money. This makes Archie mad because he thinks that the husband should be working. There are also some flashback episodes. The first one is about the first time Archie and Michael meet. It is a very famous episode and Michael got the name \"meathead\" in it. In the third season the episode,\"The Bunkers and the Swingers\" won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. The episode was about Edith an Archie not knowing that they agreed to change husbands and wives for a night with other people who do it as a job. ===Later seasons of the show=== Later on, Archie is in a broken elevator with a woman who Archie thought was crazy, an African American businessman and a Puerto Rican man and women who is about to give birth. In season eight of the show Gloria and Michael move out of the house and move into their own house to raise their son but the house is very close to Archie and Edith's house. Michael and Gloria start to argue many times and they think they might get divorced. Michael looks to Archie for help but it does not work very much. They do stayed married for the rest of the show. Archie's ideas about transgender people are put to test when he saved a transgender person's life not knowing that they were transgender. Many important and controversial things happen in season eight of the show. During the episode \"Edith's 50th Birthday\" a man who is dressed up as a police officer tried to rape Edith. Edith fights him off but has a very hard time telling Archie about it. Another time Archie and Michael are locked in Kelsey's Bar together and they argue but become very close and Archie finally tells Michael that he loves him. Later in the show Archie and Edith raise a young girl named Stephanie Mills who was abandoned by her father and her mother (Edith's cousin). Archie buys a bar with a friend and they own it. The story of All in the Family continued in Archie Bunker's Place and the house is the main place with a new family named the \"Cumberbatches\" in the spin-off show 704 Hauser but the show was cancelled less than a month after it started. ==Creating the show== ===The first pilot episode=== All in the Family is based on the 1960s British sitcom television show Till Death Us Do Part. Norman Lear said he read about the show in a Variety magazine. He thought the show was like the relationship that he had with his father. Norman Lear bought the rights to use Til Death Us Do Part and used the ideas of the show in All in the Family. Norman Lear is the creator of All in the Family. He would also add some of the things his father did into the show. CBS wanted to have the show but the show was going to be on ABC. There was two pilot episodes made. One was made on September 3, 1968 and called And Justice For All. The pilot episodes had different actors and actresss for Michael (Tim McIntire) and Gloria Stivic (Kelly Jean Peters) and the house they lived in looked different. Archie and Edith were named \"Archie Justice\" and \"Edith Justice\" instead of Archie Bunker and Edith Bunker. Micheal was named “Dickie” for the first pilot. Lionel Jefferson was played by D'Urville Martin instead of Mike Evans. For the start of the episode, Archie and Edith were singing, \"Those were the Days\" but the song was longer and shots of where they lived were shown but not them. Also Edith played the piano faster in this pilot episode then the rest of the show. The camera showed the door mat which said \"Justice\" before the episode started. The pilot was taped with three cameras so the people watching could see the characters feelings about things. This would be used for the entire show. Most other sitcoms used one camera but All in the Family was the first and more sitcoms used three cameras after. The pilot talked about many important issues instead of just one. The characters talked about race, welfare, antisemitism, and even different types of sausage. The ending credits of the pilot episode is the kitchen room with the party decorations up. Edith and Archie are singing the same song from the beginning as the credits roll. ===The second pilot episode=== ABC did not like the first pilot because they did not think Archie and Edith were good together but ABC gave Lear the money to make a second pilot. The episode was made on February 10, 1969 in Los Angeles and it was called Those were the Days. The second pilot episode was almost the same as the first pilot episode but in this pilot Gloria was played by Candice Azzara and Chip Oliver played Richard. Richard was the name of Michael Stivic's character and was named \"Dickie\" in the first pilot episode. D'Urville Martin played Lionel Jefferson again. Another difference from the pilot episodes and the rest of the show is that Edith can be rude to Archie at times and calls Archie,\"Mr. Religion.\" For the start of this pilot episode, Edith and Archie are singing \"Those were the Days\" the same way it would be for the rest of the show. After Edith and Archie start to sing, shots of the neighborhood that they live in are shown but not Manhattan. The ending credits are Archie and Edith singing the same song but they are not shown. Instead the same shots from the opening song is shown but backwards. This was used for the rest of the show. The pilots both had the same story. Gloria and Richard are making a surprise anniversary party for Edith and Archie. Gloria does not want Richard to argue with Archie. Their friend, Lionel Jefferson was fixing the toilet for them. When Richard and Gloria leave Archie and Edith come home, Edith is surprised to see the party. But when Richard and Gloria come back, Richard and Archie start to argue about controversial ideas. Gloria tells Archie that she is going to leave because they keep arguing but she does not. Lionel comes back to the house and Archie tries to show Richard that he likes African- Americans but insults Jewish people instead. Lionel and Richard play a joke on Archie and try to make him think that he is Jewish. Edith opens a present from Archie but he did not make it. She is very happy but Archie is confused. The episodes end with Archie insulting Richard. ===Making the rest of the show=== This was the last pilot and it would be two years until the first episode of the All in the Family was made. Both of the pilot episodes were never put on television. ABC did not like the show because they thought it was too controversial and because another show, Turn-On was ended after one episode. They also thought that the people who watch ABC would not like Archie Bunker. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin took back the screenplay and thought about making a movie with All in the Family and not a show because Norman and Bud has made good movies. Norman Lear had a meeting with United Artists about making movies and Bud had a meeting with CBS. CBS thought about getting All in the Family back. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin agreed to make 13 episodes for the first season and CBS bought the show back. The show was filmed at CBS Television City in Hollywood from 1971 to 1975 and then was filmed at Metromedia Square also in Hollywood, from 1975 to 1979. Tandem Productions was the company that produced the show. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin created the company. Norman Lear wanted the show to be made in black and white but CBS would not let him. The furniture in the show did not have many colors in them this was because Norman Lear wanted the people watching the show to make it feel like they were looking at family photos. All in the Family was the first American sitcom to be recorded in front of a live audience. Each episode is 25 or 26 minutes long. CBS had a warning before each episode to warn the people watching that controversial topics would be talked about on the show, but they did it to make people laugh. CBS did this so people would know before the show started if they were going to be offended by what was on the show. Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers played Michael and Gloria instead and the first episode was put on television on January 12, 1971. All in the Family was not famous in the first season. But the show started to become famous when CBS had reruns of the first season on television. ===Setting and location=== All in the Family takes place in Astoria which is a neighbourhood in Queens, New York. Many episodes of the show take place at Archie and Edith's house. The address for the house of Archie and his family is 704 Hauser but the address is not real. The house is real and is in Greendale also in New York. The Bunkers live near New York State Route 25A which is where Kelsey's Bar is and where Archie Bunker's Place is set. Many of the places mentioned in the show are real. Like the high school that Archie Bunker goes too is a real high school in Flushing, New York. ==Cultural impact== Most sitcoms before All in the Family did not talk about controversial issues. All in the Family became very famous because it talked about controversial topics like race and sexuality but in a funny way. Many people liked the show because they thought the show was relatable for them because the show was about average people in the 1970s. Norman Lear used this when he made other shows like Sanford and Son. All in the Family won many awards for it's success. The chairs that Archie Bunker and Edith sit in and the table that is in between the chairs are on display at the National Museum of American History. On the table is Archie's favorite beer and a bowl to stop his cigar when he is done smoking. The hat that Archie wears on the show is also at this museum. During the 1972 United States presidential election, shirts, and buttons were sold that said \"Archie Bunker for President.\" In 1998, the United States Postal Service created a stamp that cost 33 cents and was about All in the Family.All in the Family stamp at National Postal Museum, Smithsonian Institution Arago.si.edu In the sound recordings of the Watergate scandal the then-U.S President Richard Nixon was heard talking about how All in the Family \"glorifies homosexuality.\" He talks about Archie Bunker and calls Michael his \"hippie son-in-law\" but not does not say the show's name. Richard Nixon liked the show, having been mentioned many times in the sitcom and even been the plot of the second episode of the show. Nixon did not go on the show. The rapper, Redman says Archie Bunker name in some of his songs when rapping about cigars because Archie is very well known for smoking large cigars. ==Characters== ===Main characters=== A main character is a character who is in almost all the episodes or is important to the story. *Archie Bunker: Archie Bunker is played by Carroll O'Connor.

But Gloria, Checking In, and 704 Hauser were not successful and were cancelled. * Maude was the first spin-off of All in the Family. It started in 1972 and is about Edith Bunker's liberal cousin, Maude Findlay after she moved to Upstate New York. The show deals with many controversial issues like All in the Family. **Good Times is a spin-off of Maude. The actress Esther Rolle played Florida Evans in both television shows. The show is about an African American family in the Chicago housing project. The show became very famous. Some people think that Good Times is not a spin-off because the show changes the name of Florida Evans's husband and Maude's name is not said in the show. * The Jeffersons is a spin-off of All in the Family and even had more seasons then All in Family. It is the longest lasting spin-off of All in the Family. The show is about Archie Bunker's old neighbours, The Jeffersons moving out to a new home in the East Side of New York City. **Checking In is a spin-off of The Jeffersons. It is about the maid in The Jeffersons getting a new job at a hotel. Not many people liked the show. The show only had four episodes and in The Jeffersons it is said that the hotel where the maid worked at and where the show took place burned down so she came back. * Archie Bunker's Place is a spin-off of All in the Family and is about Archie Bunker after the end of All in the Family. Archie owns a bar in Queens. Stephanie Mills who was in the last season of All in the Family is in this show. The last time Michael is seen is on the show. During the show Archie's wife, Edith dies of a stroke because Jean Stapleton who plays Edith did not want to play Edith anymore. **Gloria is a spin-off of All in the Family and is about Gloria Stivic raising her son after her husband, Michael left her. The show had one season. Archie was going to be in the show but it did not happen. An episode of Archie Bunker's Place was used to start this show. *704 Hauser is a spin-off of All in the Family and is about a new family living in the house the Bunker's used to live in almost 20 years later. Unlike in All in the Family where the parents are conservative and the children are liberals, in 704 Hauser the son is conservative and his parents are liberals. John Amos the actor from Good Times is in the show. Joey Stivic (son of Michael and Gloria Stivic) is in the show. The show was cancelled less than a month after it started. This is the last spin-off and last time the fictional universe of All in the Family and it's spin-offs are seen. ===2019 television special=== On May 22, 2019 ABC aired a television program special.
