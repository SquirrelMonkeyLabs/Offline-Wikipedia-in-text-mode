 "text": "There are different movements in Christianity. Over time, each of these movements developed a number of rules to follow. An ecclesiastical court is a court of law that only uses one of these sets of rules to judge people. In the case of the Roman Catholic Church, these rules are known as Canon law, and they can be found in the Codex Iuris Canonici. == Other websites == *Sądy duchowne Kościoła Katolickiego Category:Christianity Category:Courts (law)",
