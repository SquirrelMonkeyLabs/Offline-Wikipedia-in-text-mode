 "text": "This is an incomplete list of the most massive stars discovered. Although O type stars are considered the most massive stars in the main sequence, evolved stars such as wolf-rayet stars and luminous blue variables can be just as massive or even more massive than them. These stars are extremely luminous, observing them are very difficult because they are extremely rare and most of them are located in young star-forming regions very far away. Stars at larger distances can be hard to observe, the large amount of gas surrounding them can make them much harder to even be detected. == List == The stars in the list below are at least 100 solar masses. 1 solar mass = 1.989e+30 kg Star name Galaxy Mass (in solar masses) Spectral type More information Westerhout 49-2 Milky Way O2-3.5If* BAT99-98 Large Magellanic Cloud 226 N/A R136a1 Large Magellanic Cloud 196 WN5h Melnick 42 Large Magellanic Cloud 189 O2If* Westerhout 51-57 Milky Way 160 O4V R136a3 Large Magellanic Cloud 155 WN5h VFTS 682 Large Magellanic Cloud 153 WN5h HD 15558 A Milky Way 152 O5.5III(f) R136a2 Large Magellanic Cloud 151 WN5h Melnick 34 Large Magellanic Cloud 147 WN5h R136c Large Magellanic Cloud 142 WN5h HD 97950 B Milky Way 132 WN6h HD 269810 Large Magellanic Cloud 130 O2III(f*) HD 97950 A1a Milky Way 120 WN6h WR 24 Milky Way 114 N/A Cygnus OB2#12 Milky Way 110 B3-4Ia+ Candidate LBV HD 93129 Milky Way 110 O2If* Westerhout 49-3 Milky Way 105 O3-O7V R99 Large Magellanic Cloud 103 LBV WR 102ka Milky Way 100 Ofpe/WN9 Eta Carinae A Milky Way 100 LBV The Sun has one solar mass.
