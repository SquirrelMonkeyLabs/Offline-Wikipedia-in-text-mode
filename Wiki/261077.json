 "text": "Cannon Street stationAlso known (but rarely) as 'London Cannon Street': is a central London railway terminus and London Underground station complex in the City of London, the financial district of London. It is built on the site of the mediaeval Steelyard, the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. == Rail == This is a terminal station approached across the River Thames by the Cannon Street Railway Bridge, with entrances from Cannon Street and Dowgate Hill. Its approach by rail is by a triangular connection to both London Bridge station and Charing Cross station. Cannon Street is one of seventeen UK railway stations managed by Network Rail. === Original structure === The station was opened by the South Eastern Railway on 1 September 1866. The original station building had two Wren-style towers, square and high, which faced on to the River Thames. The towers supported a long iron train shed crowned by a high single arch, almost semicircular, of glass and iron. To this was joined in 1867 an Italianate style hotel and forecourt. These gave passenger facilities, as well as an impressive frontage onto the street. == References == Category:Railway stations in London Category:Circle line stations Category:District line stations Category:1866 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1860s establishments in England",
