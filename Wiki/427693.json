 "text": "Transit buses (also city buses, town buses or public buses) are public transport vehicles that transport people for short and medium distances, especially within the same city. Public transit buses often use large or multiple exit and entry doors to make boarding and exiting easier, and have minimal to moderate luggage spaces (or none at all), and air conditioner/heating for passengers and drivers. Pull chains or cords are also used on public buses. Fares are usually paid with cash, tickets or certain credit/debit cards. Many people prefer using public buses, instead of driving their own automobile for many reasons (such as not able or willing to drive).",
