 "text": "Robin Hood is a 1922 silent movie. It stars Douglas Fairbanks. Robin Hood was the first movie to have a Hollywood premiere. The premiere was held at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre on October 18, 1922. The movie's full title is Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood. It was one of the most expensive movies of the 1920s. It cost about $1,000,000 to make. The movie is about the famous English outlaw. The movie received mostly good reviews. In spite of the movie's careful construction, it received some negative responses. Vachel Lindsay thought the movie was \"a heavy exhibit of armor that does not move.\" He thought it a failure because the first half of the movie was basically spectacle. Nonetheless, Robin Hood was thought at the time to be a milestone in the development of movie art. It would be overshadowed however by the hugely popular Errol Flynn movie of 1938. ==Notes== ==References== * Vance, Jeffrey. 2008. Douglas Fairbanks.
