 "text": "'03 Bonnie & Clyde is a single by rapper Jay-Z, featuring American singer and songwriter Beyoncé. It was taken from his ninth studio album The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse (2002) and can also be found on the international editions of Beyoncé's first solo album Dangerously in Love. Released in 2002, the song reached number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It was Jay-Z's second top ten single and Beyoncé's first top ten single as a solo artist. It also reached number two in the United Kingdom. The single is notable for causing drama between Jay-Z and Toni Braxton over what she said was a stolen sample. Jay-Z had to work with Suge Knight to secure the rights to cover this song from Tupac Shakur, because he made the original version of the song, which was called \"Me and My Girlfriend\". \"Me and My Girlfriend\" was on his 1996 classic The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory. Jay-Z also referenced this in his song \"All I Need\" from The Blueprint. == Music video == The music video for the song, which was directed by Chris Robinson, was nominated for \"Best Hip-Hop Video\" at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. However, it lost to Missy Elliott's \"Work It.\" The name of the song is a reference to Eminem's song \"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\". There is a changed version of it called \"Bonnie & Clyde '03\" which has many of Beyoncé's vocals rather than Jay-Z's. It is included in her \"Dangerously In Love\" CD. == Official versions == * \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" (Clean version for the radio) * \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" (Instrumental) * \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" (Radio E) == References == Category:2002 songs Category:Beyoncé songs Category:Jay-Z songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Rap songs Category:R&B; songs",
