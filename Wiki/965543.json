 "text": "The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish. It is also known as the Eurasian carp or just carp. It is found in lakes and rivers in Europe and Asia. Since it is a destructive invasive species, it is part of the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species. The type subspecies is Cyprinus carpio carpio, found in the Danube and Volga River. == Description == === Appearance === The Eurasian carp has a robust body with a dark gold sheen. It has big, shiny scales on its body. It has large pectoral fins and a tapering dorsal fin. The longest-lived common carp was 64 years old and the biggest recorded carp weighed 45.59 kg. When they're given sufficient space and nutrients, these fishes can grow to a very large size. === Its food === Since they are omnivorous, they will devour aquatic plants and seeds, insects, crustaceans, mollusks, benthic worms, fish eggs, and leftovers. === Home === Common carp live in freshwater environments, preferably large bodies of slow water. == Introduction == === United States === In 1831, Eurasian carp were introduced into the United States. These fish are not usually eaten anymore because they are pests. They are attempting to reduce the common carp's population by 75% in Utah to save the June sucker from extinction. == As food == Common carp is eaten in Central Europe as part of Christmas Eve. In the United States, it's not usually eaten because shoppers usually like fillets. == Gallery == File:Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio), Dead - Killarney, Ontario.jpg|A dead common carp File:Cyprinus carpio 2008 G1.jpg File:Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) (51022534501).jpg|image == References == # Taylor, J., R.
