 "text": "The First Frame House also known as the Allen House, was a historic wood frame building in Monterey, California, United States. It stood on Webster Street in downtown Monterey. After its demolition in 1923, a service station was constructed in its place. It was the first pre-fabricated frame house in Monterey, shipped from Australia and then reconstructed in California. ==History== The First Frame House was designed and built in Australia by Bushnell & Hanson, then dismantled, labeled, and loaded onto their ship, the Independence, along with their furnishings and belongings, ensuring she would live in comfort. The house came by ship across Cape Horn from Australia. The 14-room oak-framed house was assembled in 1847 on Webster Street in downtown Monterey. Its owner, Timothy Bushton, arrived in California with his wife, Jame, and ailing daughter, hoping Monterey’s climate would restore her health. After Bushton’s passing, his widow, Jane Bushton, married Thomas E. Allen. Their son, Thomas W. Allen Jr., constable of Monterey, resided in the house with his wife and children. The Allen house was the first fully pre-fabricated frame house in Monterey, California. It was demolished in 1923 and replaced by a service station. ==References== ==External links== * First Frame House in California Built at Monterey in 1849 * Allen House.
