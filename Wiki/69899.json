 "text": "An ammeter is a measuring tool used to measure the flow of electric current in a circuit. The electric current is measured in amperes; for this reason, some people call the ammeters as ampmeters, by mistake. It can measure 'resistance' of a current, speed of a current and force of a current (the units used are ohms, amperes, and volts) Ammeters are connected in series in a circuit with two connections. ==Related pages== * Voltmeter Category:Measuring tools",
