 "text": "A file is a tool used to shape materials, by wearing away some of it. Today, files are usually made of a steel bar that has a rough surface. By rubbing the surface against a material, some of the material is scraped away. There are also nail files used to shape a person's fingernails. Files can also make a surface smooth so that there are no gaps, which is useful when two surfaces need to be attached to each other. A file is \"blunt\" if it is the same size on both ends, and \"tapered\" if one end is smaller than the other. Category:Cutting tools",
