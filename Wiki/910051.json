 "text": "The Surinam golden-eyed tree frog, Surinam gold-eyed milk frog, or Surinam casque-headed frog (Trachycephalus coriaceus) is a frog that lives in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, French Guiana, and Guyana. Scientists think it might also live in Colombia. This frog lives in flooded forests. It might also live in forests that are not flooded. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 5.2 to 6.0 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 5.3 to 6.5 cm long. The adult female frog is brown, reddish brown, and gray to tan. Sometimes the frog has patterns on the back. It has black and near-white lines. The webbing between its toes is red. The sides of its upper hind legs are red. The bottoms of its feet are red. The belly and throat are yellow. ==Food and actions== This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It sits and waits for food to wander by and then catches it. When a human being picks up this frog, it puffs itself up to look larger than it really is. Scientists think the frog does this to make animal that might eat it go away, but they are not sure. The male frogs also puff up when they sing for females. When it is time for the female frog to lay eggs, the frogs come to permanent or temporary bodies of water. The male frogs puff up all the way and make loud growling sounds. The female frog lays eggs on the surface of the water. ==Threats== There are fewer frogs than there were because human beings change the places where this frog lives. For example, human beings cut down forests to collect wood. Human beings also catch the frogs to sell to collectors or to sell as pets. The Cashinahua and Achuar people also catch this frog to eat. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
