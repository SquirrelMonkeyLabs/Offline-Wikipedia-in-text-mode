 "text": "Infiniti is a brand of luxury cars made by the Japanese company Nissan. It started on November 8, 1989, in North America. The Infiniti logo looks like a road going to the horizon. It also looks like Mount Fuji, which is a symbol of Japan. == History == In 1989, Infiniti started in the United States to sell premium cars that were different from the regular Nissan cars. At the same time, other Japanese companies like Toyota and Honda made their own luxury brands, Lexus and Acura. Infiniti started with two cars: the Q45 and the M30. The Q45 was based on the Nissan President, a car sold in Japan. It was a big luxury car with a V8 engine and many special features. It competed with expensive cars like the Mercedes S-Class and BMW 7 Series. The second car, the M30, was a smaller two-door car. It was based on the Nissan Leopard. The M30 was not as powerful as the Q45, and it did not sell very well. In 1996, Infiniti made the J30, a smaller luxury car to compete with the Lexus ES. But it did not do well because it was small inside and had strange styling. It was replaced in 1996 by the Infiniti I series, which was related to the Nissan Maxima, and in 2002 by the Infiniti G35. By the time, Infiniti had 230 dealers in 15 countries. In September 1990, Infiniti introduced a new car, the Infiniti G20. It was based on the Nissan Primera, a small car made for Europe. In 1992, Infiniti launched a new four-door car called the J30. It came with one engine option. This engine was also used in other cars like the Nissan 300ZX and the Nissan Cedric. == References == Category:1989 establishments in Japan Category:Automobile companies of Japan Category:Nissan",
