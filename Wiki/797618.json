It stars James McAvoy and Anya Taylor- Joy. ==Cast== *James McAvoy as Kevin Wendell Crumb / The Horde *Anya Taylor- Joy as Casey Cooke *Betty Buckley as Dr. Karen Fletcher *Bruce Willis as David Dunn (cameo) ==Production== Shyamalan revealed that Kevin Crumb was going to be the secondary villain of Unbreakable but he felt it would make the movie too complicated. Since the movie was made by Universal instead of Touchstone Pictures, Shyamalan asked the Walt Disney Company to use David Dunn as a character and got to use him for free in exchange for a follow-up to both movies. ==Other websites== * Category:2016 horror movies Category:American horror movies Category:Dissociative identity disorder in movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies directed by M.
