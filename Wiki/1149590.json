 "text": "The blue-breasted poison frog, beautiful-breasted poison frog, beautiful- breasted poison arrow frog, or Silverstone's poison frog (Ameerega pulchripecta) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives in the Amazon. People see it on the dead leaves on the ground in rainforests. Scientists saw the frog between 100 and 310 meters above sea level. Scientists have only seen this frog in protected parks. Two of them are Floresta Nacional do Amapá and Parque Natural Municipal do Cancão. ==Young== The adult male frogs sit under plant roots no higher than 40 cm above the ground. Then they call to the female frogs. Scientists think the female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground and that, after the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans do cut down trees to get wood to build with and mark farms. People might also catch this frog to sell as a pet. Scientists say this does not happen enough to make the frog die out. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
