 "text": "Litoria hunti is a tree frog from northern Papua New Guinea. The New Guineans call it \"Wowo.\" Scientists have only seen it in Utai, which is in Sanduan Province, but they think it lives in many other places on the island of New Guinea. The adult male frog has pads on its feet called nuptial pads. The adult male frog is 57.9-60.4 mm long from nose to rear end. It is bright green on the back and sometimes has a white stripe from its jaw to its ear. The climbing discs on its feet are white. It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw. Scientists could hear this frog calling from the trees 5 to 8 meters above the ground, so they think it lays eggs in pools on the forest floor. But they did not see the frogs doing this. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
