 "text": "The Waza tree frog, Nonggang small tree frog, or Nong Gang bush frog (Orixalus waza) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and China. People have seen it between 200 and 650 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen forests in places with karst rock or limestone in the ground, for example limestone cliffs. It can live in places with no large bodies of water nearby. People have seen it in forests that were cut down and grew back. Scientists think the frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole, like other frogs in Gracixalus and Orixalus. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives. For example, people build mines and take limestone in the karst forests in Vietnam. People also build farms and get wood to build with. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Nonggang National Nature Reserve in China. Scientists used to think Gracixalus nonggangensis and Orixalus waza were two different frogs, but now they think they are the same species of frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
