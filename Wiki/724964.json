The festival was the largest of its kind. It showed American, international, independent, and family-friendly films from all around the world. It showed films that leave the audience feeling good. The FGFF was a three-day event held every year. It was held in August. Some films were short films, screenplays, or student films. ==History== ===Mission=== Kristen Flores, FGFF Founder and Festival Director, started the Feel Good Film Festival in Hollywood August 22â€“24, 2008. Flores was quoted as saying \"It isn't necessarily difficult to find feel-good films to screen. They've been looking for an outlet,\". The mission of the festival is \"a film viewing experience for the entire family that encourages the development, production, and distribution of short or feature length films with positive themes, happy endings, that make audiences laugh, and that capture the beauty of our world\". The traditional \"red carpet\" was replaced with a sunburst yellow carpet in keeping with the \"Feel Good\" theme of sunflowers.Patricia J.
