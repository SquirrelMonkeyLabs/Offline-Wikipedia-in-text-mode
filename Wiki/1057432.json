 "text": "The WAGR H class were a total of 2 steam locomotives built in 1889 by Neilson & Coy of Glasgow, Scotland for operation by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR). The H class were 0-6-0 side tank engines with one, No. 18 entering service on the Eastern Railway, the other, No. 17 was stored at Bunbury awaiting the opening of the Bunbury to Boyanup line. Although the WAGR attempted to move No. 17 to the Eastern Railway this was protested by the locals, so No. 17 stayed at Bunbury until mid-1890 when it began operating construction trains under the new number 22. Upon the Bunbury to Boyanup line's opening No. 18 was transferred to Bunbury to work alongside No. 22. During the construction of the Fremantle Harbour South-mole both engines were used to haul materials from 1895 to 1897. No.18 was sold in 1904 and No. 22 in 1907 to the Goldfields Water Supply Administration for the Mundaring Weir Branch line but both became WAGR property once more in 1909 when the WAGR's jurisdiction extended to the branch line. No. 22 was sold to contractors Smith & Timms for the construction of the Marble Bar Railway before returning to the WAGR once more in 1912 being used as jetty shunter at Port Hedland, being scrapped in 1956. No. 18 was reallocated to the Public Works Department (PWD) for operation at Fremantle Harbour North Quay and later on at Esperance. In 1926 No. 18 was relocated to Bunbury until its withdrawal in the late 1950s. No. 18 was preserved after being donated to the ARHS and Rail Heritage W.A. in 1962. It was restored at Midland Railway Workshops and then was displayed at Bassendean Railway Museum, but in 2018 moved to the South West Rail & Heritage Centre in Boyanup where it is currently displayed.
