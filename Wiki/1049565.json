 "text": "Roarchestes indigo is a frog. It lives in India, high in the mountains where small trees grow. Scientists have seen it between 1400 and 1700 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests high in the mountains where the trees do not grow tall. It lives on the ground near the dead leaves. People have not seen this frog in grasslands. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog, like other frogs in Raorchestes do. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of dying out because it only lives in one place: Kudremukh National Park. They also say that, if climate change makes the places where the frog lives too dry, then it could be in much danger of dying. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis could kill this frog through the disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
