 "text": "The Munich air disaster occurred on 6 February 1958 when British European Airways Flight 609 crashed on its third attempt to take off from a slush- covered runway at Munich-Riem Airport, Munich, Bavaria, West Germany. On the plane was the Manchester United football team, nicknamed the \"Busby Babes\", along with supporters and journalists. 20 of the 44 on the aircraft died at the scene. Three more died at a Munich hospital, resulting in 23 fatalities with 21 survivors. An investigation said that the crash was caused by the slush on the runway, which slowed the plane too much to take off. ==Deaths== ===Crew members=== *Captain Kenneth \"Ken\" Rayment. Co-pilot.
