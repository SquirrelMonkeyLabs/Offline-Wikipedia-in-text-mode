 "text": "Hydraulics is a topic of science and engineering subject dealing with the mechanical properties of liquids. Many machines work on hydraulic power. One of the founders of modern hydraulics was Benedetto Castelli, a student of Galileo Galilei. Fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the engineering uses of fluid properties. == Related pages == *Archimedes' screw *Hydrology == Other websites == * International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research (IAHR) * visualization of hydraulic concepts * Information about Fluid Power is also available on the National Fluid Power Association web-site nfpa.com * Decision tree to choose an uncertainty method for hydrological and hydraulic modelling Category:Engineering",
