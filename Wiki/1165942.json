 "text": "SPAR Hungary (Hungarian: SPAR Magyarország) is the Hungarian member company of the Dutch international food chain SPAR. The international food chain, headquartered in the Netherlands, is present in 48 countries in Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia, including Hungary. It is one of the largest food retail chains in the world. According to the Coface CEE Top 500 ranking, it is the 19th largest company in Hungary and the 121st and 152nd largest company in Central and Eastern Europe in 2021 and 2022, respectively. == History == The Hungarian subsidiary is managed by ASPIAG (Austria SPAR International AG), founded in 1990. In the early 1990s, it established a SPAR network in Hungary, Slovenia and Northern Italy, and has been present in Croatia since 2005. SPAR opened its first store in Hungary on October 30, 1991 in Tata, after gaining a majority stake in Generál Kereskedelmi Rt., which then operated many food stores in Komárom-Esztergom County. SPAR's strategy focused on both quality and quantity, aiming to open stores that are easy to reach, near residential areas, and in central locations, with various store sizes. Between 1991 and 1993, SPAR converted many of the Generál stores in Komárom-Esztergom County into SPAR stores. In 1993, SPAR opened its first two stores outside the county, one in Székesfehérvár and another in Budapest. SPAR opened its first domestic logistics center in Bicske in 1994, responsible for the supply of goods. This warehouse base has been expanding along with the SPAR network, with continuous modernization, and today it also houses the company's administrative center. In 1998, SPAR reached a significant milestone by opening its 100th store in Hungary. The store in Pilisvörösvár was special because it was the first to operate under a franchise model in Hungarian grocery retail, through a partnership agreement with Hertzman Kereskedelmi Kft. In 2012, SPAR introduced its original business philosophy, similar to the Dutch model, in Hungary with the creation of the SPAR Partner Program. When SPAR was founded in 1932 in the Netherlands, it was built on the motto \"Mutual cooperation benefits everyone\" which translates to \"Door Eendrachtig Samenwerken Profiteren Allen Regelmatig\" in Dutch. The acronym DESPAR, which means \"spruce\" in Dutch, comes from the first letters of these words. The concept is to bring as many independent retailers into the SPAR network through franchising,Franchise-hálózattal bővít a Spar allowing them to retain their independence while enjoying benefits like weekly deliveries six times, marketing and logistical support, and the SuperShop loyalty program. == Store types == === SPAR Supermarket === SPAR supermarkets are focusing on providing daily necessities in stores located near residential areas. These stores generally have sales areas ranging from 400 to 1,200 square meters, with 345 such stores in Hungary. === City SPAR === City SPAR stores are designed to serve shoppers who regularly visit urban, downtown hubs. Shoppers can find new product categories in these stores, including ready-to-eat foods like sandwiches, pizzas, salads, freshly baked goods, grilled items, and cold cuts. These stores typically have a sales area of about 200 to 400 square meters. === INTERSPAR Hypermarket === The INTERSPAR hypermarket first appeared in Hungary in 1995, with the first one opening in Győr. This type of store combines the features of a supermarket with those of a hypermarket, offering a complete range of food products alongside a wide selection of other household items, all at competitive prices, providing the opportunity for both daily and bulk shopping in one location. INTERSPAR locations are easily accessible by foot or public transport, and there are hundreds of free parking spaces for car owners. Within the SPAR Hungary network, there are currently 34 INTERSPAR hypermarkets. Some of these are located in shopping centers, while others operate as standalone units. These hypermarkets, with sales areas ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 square meters, offer about 30,000 different products, two- thirds of which are food items, including an attractive selection of fresh produce. Additionally, these stores sell electronics, household items, toys, clothing, stationery, textiles, seasonal products, and other goods. === SPAR Express and DESPAR === The SPAR Express and DESPAR offers the possibility of quick shopping, taking just 4–5 minutes, for both drivers stopping at OMV and Orlen gas stations and local residents. === SPAR Market === In the SPAR franchise network, SPAR Market stores represent the smaller units. These stores are operated by private traders but feature the SPAR logo both on their exterior and inside the sales area, along with SPAR's point-of-sale promotional materials. Their product range includes SPAR Hungary's own and exclusive brands, as well as pre-packaged meat products from the company's Regnum meat plant, which are guaranteed quality checked. Most of their inventory is delivered from the SPAR logistics center. Each week, the company issues a two-page flyer specifically for the promotions and offerings of the SPAR Market stores. This type of store is mainly found in small towns and villages. === SPAR Partner === In the SPAR franchise network, SPAR Partner stores represent the bigger units. ==References== Category:Supermarkets of Hungary Category:Pages with unreviewed translations",
