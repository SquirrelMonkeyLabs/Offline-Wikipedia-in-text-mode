 "text": "Louis Patrick Gray III (July 18, 1916 â€“ July 6, 2005) was Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from May 2, 1972 to April 27, 1973. He was in charge of the initial investigation into the burglaries that sparked the Watergate scandal, which eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon. Gray was nominated as permanent Director by Nixon on February 15, 1973, but failed to win Senate confirmation. He resigned as Acting FBI director on April 27, 1973, after he admitted to destroying documents from Watergate. Gray remained publicly silent about the Watergate scandal for 32 years, speaking to the press only once, near the end of his life. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Category:Politicians from St. Louis, Missouri Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
