 "text": "The Somali diaspora describes Somalis who were born in Greater Somalia but have moved to other places. About 2,000,000 people from Somalia now live outside the country's borders. Many fled because of the civil war in Somalia. A terrible drought (the worst in 40 years), rising food prices, famine, and floods have led others to leave the country. A million Somalis fled their homes in the first five months of 2023 alone. Many of these people moved to Europe, North America, Southern Africa and Australia. However, as of 2023, 80% of Somali refugees - a total of 714,390 people - live in neighboring countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Yemen. Some people have lived in refugee camps in Kenya or Ethiopia for many years. Many people have now settled in new countries, become citizens and had children. It is difficult to count exactly how many Somalis are living outside the country as part of the Somali diaspora. There are Somali communities around the world, including: *Ethiopia: 308,415 (in 2023) * Kenya: 308,367 (in 2023) * Uganda: 69,533 (in 2023) * Yemen: 46,750 (in 2023) * The Malaysia: 116,520 (in 2021) * The United Kingdom: 176,645 (in 2021) * Sweden: 68,678 (in 2018) * Canada: 62,550 (in 2013) * Norway: 43,196 (in 2016) * The Netherlands: 39,465 (in 2016) * United Arab Emirates: 38,675 (in 2019) * Denmark: 21,050 (in 2016); * Finland: 20,007 (in 2017). == References == Category:Emigration",
