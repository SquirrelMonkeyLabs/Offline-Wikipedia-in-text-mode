 "text": "A prison uniform is a standardized suit inmates in correctional and other incarcerating facilities are made to wear. The purposes of such uniforms are to humiliate prisoners as part of the punishment, making it easier to prevent prison escape by making it easy to spot an inmate in the process of escaping or who has just escaped, to greatly limit the possibility of self harm that's easier with free world clothes, identifying inmates on chain gangs in areas that still use them, promoting equality, etc. In North America, prison uniforms usually are styled after jumpsuits or medical scrubs, though other varieties are also used. Jumpsuit style uniforms usually have short sleeves. Category:Prisons Category:Uniforms",
