 "text": "Jessica S. Fortin is a Canadian-American veterinary anatomic pathologist, toxicologist, and assistant professor at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine. She is known for her research on protein folding disorders and drug discovery. == Education == Fortin studied at Université Laval in Quebec, Canada, where she earned a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in chemistry in 2006 and a Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degree in 2004. She later completed a Master of Science (MSc) with honors in medicinal chemistry at Université Laval in 2008. She earned a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree from the Université de Montréal in 2015 and 2016, respectively. During her PhD studies, she developed an interest in protein folding disorders. From 2015 to 2018, Fortin completed a residency program in veterinary anatomic pathology at the University of Missouri. == Career == After her residency, Fortin became a fixed-term assistant professor at Michigan State University, where she founded the Fortin Drug Discovery Lab. Her work focused on studying diseases that involved protein misfolding, such as neurodegenerative conditions and type 2 diabetes. In August 2021, she joined Purdue University as a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Basic Medical Sciences. Her research combines medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology to develop new therapies. Fortin holds certifications as a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Anatomic Pathologists and the American Board of Toxicology. == Research == Fortin’s research investigates protein folding disorders and their role in diseases. Her lab aims to design drugs that target these abnormalities, with applications in veterinary and human medicine. == References == Category:Purdue University faculty",
