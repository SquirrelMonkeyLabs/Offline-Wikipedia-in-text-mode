 "text": "Guido Cantelli (27 April 1920 â€“ 24 November 1956) was an Italian conductor. Most people thought he was one of the greatest conductors when he was alive. Arturo Toscanini liked him very much, and thought that he was his successor. When he was still young, he had already conducted some of the greatest orchestras of the world, and in 1956 he became the director of La Scala in Milan. But a tragedy happened, and the young Cantelli died in an airplane crash just a week later. ==Biography== Cantelli was born in Novara in Italy. When he was a student, he studied with important Italian masters of music. In 1940 he started his conducting career, and in in 1943 he graduated from the Milan Conservatory. Toscanini saw him conducting at La Scala in Milan, and was very impressed by his performance. In 1945, Cantelli was performing in the most famous concert halls of the world, conducting the greatest orchestras.Sachs, Harvey, Toscanini, New York: J.B. Lippincott, 1978. The fame of Cantelli grew, and he was considered among the greatest conductors. At the same time he continued his studies, because he wanted to perfect his technique. In 1956 he became the director of La Scala, and was being considered the next music director of the New York Philharmonic. But a tragedy happened, and only a week after he was named director of La Scala, he died in an airplane crash in Paris, France. Cantelli left a wife and a 5-month-old child. Toscanini, who was in poor health (and died just some months later) was not informed of the death of his pupil. ==Referencess== Category:1920 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Italian conductors Category:People from Novara",
