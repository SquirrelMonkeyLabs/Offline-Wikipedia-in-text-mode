 "text": "Childbirth, also known as labour and delivery, is when a woman gives birth. This means it is the ending of a pregnancy where one baby or (more) babies leave the uterus by passing through the vagina or by Caesarean section. In 2015, there were about 135 million births globally. About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, called a premature birth, while between 3 and 12 percent were born after 42 weeks as a postterm delivery. Birth rate is important in determining the population growth rate. ==Related pages== *Premature birth *Postterm birth *Population growth rate *Mortality rate ==References== Category:Pregnancy and childbirth",
