 "text": "In Christianity, Repentance means to renounce a sinful life that the person lived and turns to Jesus to receive his forgiveness. Repenting can also bring healing. (2 Chronicles 7:14) However, to those who never repented, they will all perish. (Luke 13:5) To you repent you must- Admit to God that you are a sinner. Believe that God sent his one and only son to die for all of our sins. Commit yourself to a life of following Jesus and serving others. ==Other websites== * Theopedia: Repentance (conservative Calvinist perspective) * Repent America - Information on Repentance Category:Christian ethics Category:Christian terminology",
