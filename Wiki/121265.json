It costs about $50 USD per year (in America) and has over 31 million subscribers as of 2013. There are two versions of Xbox Live; Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly Gold) and Free. Free allows an online 'friends list' and downloads, but does not allow users to play games against other people online. Game Pass Core is the same as Free, but with the addition of online gaming and a free select library of games with a cost of $50/Â£40 a year. Subscribers can pay with a credit card or by special cards which are bought in shops and enter the codes online. == Microsoft Points == Microsoft Points or MS points was the previous currency of Xbox Live.
