With Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert he was involved in a series of tests done at Harvard University, in the 1960s. These tests involved psychedelic drugs. In the 1960s, professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert collaborated on a book titled The Psychedelic Experience, which adapted portions of the Tibetan Book of the Dead as a guide for use in LSD experiences. They hoped to give users of LSD a simulation of death and rebirth, to \"liberate\" them from past problems or mistakes in their lives. ==References== Category:American psychologists Category:1936 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Harvard University faculty",
