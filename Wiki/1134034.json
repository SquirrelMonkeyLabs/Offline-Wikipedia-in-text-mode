 "text": "Samuel Kwesi Oppong (died December 3, 2001), known as \"S.K. Oppong,\" was a famous actor, musician, and storyteller from Ghana. He was known for his distinctive sideburns, which made him stand out. Besides acting, he was a skilled guitarist and band leader. He had been in the music business since the 1950s, composing, singing, and recording hi-life songs. He started the SK Oppong Guitar Band, which toured Ghana and played at well-known places. The band had some success with songs like \"Obaa Kunadu,\" \"Akwankwaa Hiani,\" and \"Kyere Me Ade a Meye\" starting around 1959. == Music and Concert Party == SK Oppong was already famous as a musician before he became well-known from Osofo Dadzie. In the 1950s, he started the \"SK Oppong Guitar Band\" with talented musicians. This band became popular in Ghana as \"burger highlife\" music began to rise. The band made and performed local songs that people liked. In the 80s and 90s, Oppong started the \"S.K. Oppong Drama Group,\" which toured with Nana Kwame Ampadu's African Brothers Band and concert party. They added comedy and drama to the band's shows. Oppong became famous for playing female roles in concert party, a type of stage show that mixes drama and storytelling with pantomime. The \"S.K. Oppong Drama Group\" later changed its name to \"Osofo Dadzie Drama Group\" when it became the main drama group on Ghana's only TV station at that time, GTV. == SK Oppong & Osofo Dadzie == Oppong played a drag queen in the \"S.K. Oppong Drama Group's\" first TV show, a play called \"Aku Sika,\" which was shown on the popular show \"Anansekrom\" (Ananse Town) in 1972. The play was written by Nana Kwame Ampadu and was very well-received. The S.K. Oppong Guitar Band also joined a GTV Concert Party show called Jatokrom, which was managed by Nana Bosompra II. Seeing how drama and storytelling could educate, entertain, and inform, GBC-TV made the S.K. Oppong Drama Group their main theatre and drama group. They changed the name to \"(Pastor/Rev) Osofo Dadzie Drama Group\" to match the character of the Pastor/Rev Minister, who usually gave the main message of each play at the end. Nana Bosompra II became the producer, director, and writer for the Osofo Dadzie group, with Joris Wartenberg as the creative director. Grace Omaboe (Maame Dokono), a famous Ghanaian actress who later became known for Obra, was the group's scriptwriter. Osofo Dadzie turned popular Ghanaian stories and everyday events into dramatic performances. Oppong led Osofo Dadzie for many years after it became successful. The group gave Sunday evening TV entertainment to millions of viewers for 17 years. Oppong played many main roles, often as a virtuous and noble man. The group's dramas were very popular on GTV from the 1970s to the 1990s. Osofo Dadzie aimed to “show the problems in Ghanaian society,” like political corruption, nepotism, and bribery. This criticism upset some officials, who tried to stop the show. The plays were in the Akan language, using mostly Twi, Fante, and Akuapem. The main rival at the time was Obra. Osofo Dadzie's plays focused on themes like honesty, integrity, kindness, patience, forgiveness, endurance, and unity. Oppong often sang and sometimes played the guitar during performances. Some of his co-stars included Nathaniel Frimpong Manso (Osofo Dadzie), Asonaba Kwaku Darko (Super OD), Kwadwo Kwakye, Fred Addai, Kingsley Kofi Kyeremanteng (Ajos), Mercy Offei, Bea Kissi, Jane Ackon (Mama Jane), Akua Boahemaa, Helena Maame Adjoa Pieterson (Adjoa Pee), and Louisa Debra (Mama Lee). After Osofo Dadzie ended in 1989, Oppong took over the Kantata Drama Group. == Death == The famous S. K. Oppong passed away at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital on December 3, 2001, at the age of 55, after a long illness. Ghana's Minister of Information and Presidential Affairs at the time, Mr. Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey, called SK Oppong \"a role model who educated Ghanaians through the arts.\" On February 1, he was honored with a public viewing where many of his colleagues, fans, and people from the movie industry came to pay their respects. He was buried the next day at Osu Cemetery. == Career == SK Oppong was a talented musician and led the Osofo Dadzie drama group. He wrote many highlife songs.
