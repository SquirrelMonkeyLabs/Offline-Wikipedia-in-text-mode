Faucet Failure happens when the sink doesn't work. During this, water usually drips from the taps. Ski used this in place of the word drip, which is slang for fashion. Ski used this to mean having your own style. A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Cole Bennett. In the video, Ski sees a woman dancing and taps her on the shoulder. She turns around and it turns out to be an old man. Ski knocks the old man out. He raps next to an ostrich. Ski raps in multiple different colored rooms and dances next to a sasquatch. The old man dances dressed as Ski. The old man is now on an operating table. Ski asks what the problem with him and the doctor says he has faucet Failure, meaning be has too much drip. The sasquatch pulls his head off to reveal it was Ski. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2019 songs Category:Ski Mask the Slump God songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Trap songs",
