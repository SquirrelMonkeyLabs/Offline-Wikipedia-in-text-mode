 "text": "LGBT reproduction is when lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have biological kids. They do this with help from medical technology. This is different from LGBT parenting. LGBT parenting includes things like LGBT adoption. In recent years, scientists have been studying and making ways to help same-sex couples have kids.. The main ways being looked at are creating sperm from women and eggs from men. In 2004, Japanese scientists changed the job of some genes. They used two mouse eggs to make baby mice. In 2018, Chinese scientists made 29 female mice from two mother mice. But they couldn't make baby mice from two father mice. One possible way is to get sperm and eggs from skin stem cells. Not being able to use medical technology to have kids is seen as unfair health care for LGBT people. == Related pages == *LGBT parenting == References == Category:LGBT Category:Reproductive system",
