 "text": "Morbid Angel is an American death metal band. It was made in Tampa, Florida in 1983. It was made by Trey Azagthoth, Dallas Ward, and Mike Browning. Morbid Angel was one of the first death metal bands. They helped make death metal by playing thrash metal that sounded different. They were one of the first bands that used blast beats (a very fast type of drumming) and death metal singing. They were the first death metal band to make successful music. This is because they were a part of a large record label and their music videos were shown on MTV many times. Their first three albums have inspired many other death metal musicians. These are Altars of Madness (1989), Blessed Are the Sick (1991), and Covenant (1993). These albums are about things such as Satanism and the occult. Other Morbid Angel albums are about things such as Sumerian gods, and have anti-religious lyrics. The band's music is very complex. Decibel, a magazine, said that Trey Azagthoth was the best death metal guitarist ever. Azagthoth is the only original member still in the band. Morbid Angel is one of the best-selling death metal bands. Their third album, Covenant, sold over 150,000 copies. == Studio albums == * Altars of Madness (1989) * Blessed Are the Sick (1991) * Covenant (1993) * Domination (1995) * Formulas Fatal to the Flesh (1998) * Gateways to Annihilation (2000) * Heretic (2003) * Illud Divinum Insanus (2011) * Kingdoms Disdained (2017) == References == Category:Death metal bands Category:Musical groups established in 1983",
