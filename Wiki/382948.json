 "text": "The 1993 World Trade Center bombing happened on February 26, 1993 in the bottom section of the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, United States. Six people were killed, including a woman who was 7 months pregnant. About 1,042 people were injured. The plan was to use truck bombs parked in the parking lot of the bottom of the North Tower causing it to collapse. The main leader of the al-Qaeda cell sent to destroy the buildings hoped the explosions would cause the North Tower to collapse and hit the South Tower. The al-Qaeda cell's leader was Ramzi Yousef. The group wanted to destroy the building because many Jews worked in it. al-Qaeda's leader Osama bin Laden was disappointed to see the buildings were not destroyed, so he wanted another attack on the same building. The result would be the September 11 attacks in 2001 where 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked two planes and flew them into both of the Twin Towers killing almost 3,000 people and causing both the North Tower and South Tower to eventually collapse. ==References== ==Other websites== *Rewards for Justice World Trade Center Bombing page *\"1993: World Trade Center bomb terrorises New York\", BBC: On This Day *FBI – 1993 World Trade Center Bombing – Press Room FBI February 26, 2008 *Images from the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing *WCBS 880 radio aircheck, February 26, 1993 at sorabji.com Category:1993 in the United States Category:1990s building bombings Category:1990s in New York City Category:1990s murders in the United States Category:20th century in Manhattan Category:Al-Qaeda Category:Building bombings in the United States Category:Crime in New York City Category:Mass murder in 1993 Category:Mass murder in New York (state) Category:September 11 attacks Category:1993 disasters",
