 "text": "Shotgunning is term used for when a person punches a hole in the side of a canned drink and pulls the tab while drinking from the punctured hole. The liquid very fastly drains because of the combination of air and carbonation in the can. Shotgunning is usually done as a party trick or a competition against other people. It is usually always done with a can of beer and makes the person drunk more quickly because the body absorbs alcohol faster than the liver can metabolizes it. ==References== Category:Alcoholic drinks",
