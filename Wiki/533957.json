 "text": "At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, delegates of the United States Democratic Party chose their nominees for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the 2016 national election. It was held July 25â€“28, 2016, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, with some events at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, beginning exactly one week after the 2016 Republican National Convention. The candidates were former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of New York, and United States senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. There are 4,764 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, so a candidate needs a simple majority of 2,383 delegates including \"superdelegates\" to win the presidential nomination. On June 6, 2016, Clinton won the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, becoming the presumptive candidate. ==References== Category:2016 in Pennsylvania Category:July 2016 events Category:2010s in Philadelphia Category:Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Category:United States presidential nominating conventions",
