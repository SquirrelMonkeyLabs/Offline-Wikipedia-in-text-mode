 "text": "The llanos rocket frog (Allobates ranoides) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in forests. Scientists saw the frog between 100 and 400 meters above sea level. Scientists have not seen this frog in any protected parks, but they think it might live in Reserva Forestal Protectora Nacional Cerro Vanguardia or Reserva Forestal Protectora Nacional Ca√±o Vanguardia or both. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. They think the frogs might even all be dead now. There are no more than 50 of these frogs alive in the wild. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to make places for people to live. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis may have killed many of these frogs near the year 2001. Scientists thought the American bullfrog was hurting this frog because people brought it to the frog's home, but that was a mistake. The American bullfrog never really lived where Allobates ranoidea lived. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
