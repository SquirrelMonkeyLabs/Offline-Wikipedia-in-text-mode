 "text": "A dry county is a county in the United States whose government does not allow the sale of any kind of alcoholic beverages. Some don't allow off-premises sales, some don't allow on-premises sale, and some don't allow both. Many dry counties exist in the United States. Most of them in the South. Some smaller jurisdictions also exist, such as cities, towns, and townships, which don't allow alcohol to be sold. These are known as dry cities, dry towns, or dry townships. Dry jurisdictions can be contrasted with \"wet\" (minimal alcohol prohibitions) and \"moist\" (fewer prohibitions than \"dry\" but more than \"wet\"). Category:Local government in the United States",
