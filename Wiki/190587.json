 "text": "Ask.com is a search engine that was started in 1996. This website helps people find web pages that they are looking for, by typing in the subject they want. For example, if someone is looking for web pages about dogs, they would type in \"dogs\" or \"dog\" then press the 'search' button. Ask.com used to be called \"Ask Jeeves\" but the name was changed in 2006. Their headquarters is in Oakland, California. One thing that makes Ask.com different from other search engines is that it lets the searcher see a little picture of the web page before they click it, by putting the mouse cursor over the little binoculars without clicking it. ==Related pages== *Google *MSN *Yahoo! ==Other websites== *Ask.com *Ask.com toolbar Category:American search engines",
