 "text": "Factorization (also called factorisation and factoring) is taking a composite number apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number. These smaller numbers are called factors or divisors. 1 is a factor of all numbers. Prime factorization is breaking apart a composite number into prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the larger number. Note that since 1 is not prime, it is not included in the prime factorization. For example, 12 can be factored as 4 × 3\\. Since 4 is not a prime number, that is not its prime factorization. 12's prime factorization is in fact 3 × 2 × 2\\. The numbers which are obtained from the factorization are usually ordered, for example, starting with the smallest number. For example, 72=2^3*3^2. The factorization of every number is unique. This generalizes to: # Every number has a unique prime factorization # Every prime factorization corresponds to a unique number Since finding the numbers to multiply together is very difficult for large numbers, this fact can be used in cryptography. == Polynomials == This is how one type of polynomial is factored. x^2+{\\color{Green}9x}+20 Find two numbers that add up to 9 and can be multiplied to get 20. Here, these numbers are 4 and 5. =x^2+{\\color{Green}4x+5x}+20 =(x^2+4x)+(5x+20) =x(x+4)+5(x+4) =(x+5)(x+4) ==Related pages== *Fundamental theorem of arithmetic Category:Algebra Category:Arithmetics",
