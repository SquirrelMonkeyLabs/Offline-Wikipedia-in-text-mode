 "text": "The Karnataka leaping frog or Dubois's leaping frog (Indirana duboisi) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have been cut down and are growing back and in forests with at least some evergreen trees. This frog needs places where the tree branches come together like a roof and dead leaves on the ground. People have seen the frog on acacia farms and arecanut farms. People have seen this frog between 80 and 1042 meters above sea level. ==Young== This frog's tadpoles do not live in the water and instead move across wet rocks and moss using their tails and their back legs. Their back legs grow on them sooner than other tadpoles' back legs. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is in only some danger of dying out. They say chemicals meant to kill pests can kill this frog. Things people build for visitors may change the places where the frogs live. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog. They think it could make the dead leaves on the ground too dry for the frog to live there. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Kudremukh National Park, Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary, and Bhadra Tiger Reserve. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Indirana, but they do not know how much danger the frog is in from the fungus. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
