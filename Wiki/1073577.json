 "text": "Chhinnamasta (Sanskrit: छिन्नमस्ता, Chinnamastā, \"She whose head is severed\") is a Hindu goddess (Devi). She is one of the Mahavidyas, ten goddesses from the esoteric. The nude goddess cuts off her own head and holds it in one hand and a sword in the other. She stands or sits on a couple. Blood flows from her neck, and her head and two helpers drink it. Chhinnamasta is a goddess full of opposites. She shows both life and death, creation and destruction. Some see her as a symbol of controlling sexual energy, while others see her as pure sexual power. She stands for death, change, life, and spiritual awakening (kundalini). Her stories focus on her self-sacrifice, strong will, and fierce anger. Chhinnamasta is worshipped mainly in the Kalikula tradition of Shaktism. Although she is one of the Mahavidyas, temples and public worship for her are rare, mostly found in Nepal and Eastern India. However, she is very important in Tantric practices. She is also connected to Chinnamunda, a similar goddess in Tibetan Buddhism. Category:Hinduism Category:Hindu goddesses Category:Mahavidyas",
