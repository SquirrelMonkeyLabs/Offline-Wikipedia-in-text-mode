 "text": "The short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is one of the two species of the genus, Delphinus. It is found in warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. It is also found in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea. == Description== The short-beaked common dolphin is a medium-sized dolphin, but is smaller than the other species of the genus Delphinus, the long-beaked common dolphin. Adults grow between the lengths of 1.6 to 2 meters (5.2 to 6.6 ft), and weigh between 70 and 235 kg (150 to 520 Ib). Short-beaked common dolphins are said to be heavier than the Long-beaked common dolphin. The back of the short-beaked common dolphin is dark grey, the belly is white, and the sides are light grey, gold or yellow. == Feeding== Short-beaked common dolphins eat fish like cod, herrings, sardines, and flying fish. They also eat octopuses, squids, cuttlefish, and crustaceans. == Reproduction== Female short-beaked common dolphins are pregnant for around 10 to 11 months before giving birth to young which are 70 to 100 cm (2.3 to 3.3 ft) long, and weigh about 10 kg (22 Ib). Males mature at the age of between 3 and 12 years old, and females mature at the age of between 2 and 7 years old. They live for around 35 years, but some live for only 22 years. == Species== The short-beaked common dolphin was first thought to be the only species of the genus, Delphinus. But soon, studies show that there is another species, the long-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis). The difference between the short-beaked common dolphin and the long-beaked common dolphin is that the short-beaked common dolphin is smaller in size and has a smaller beak than the long-beaked common dolphin. ==Sources== Category:Oceanic dolphins",
