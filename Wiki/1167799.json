 "text": "Patrick Roach (born March 4, 1969) is a Canadian actor, comedian, and investor. He is best known for his role as Randy in the mockumentary Trailer Park Boys. He has acted in movies, television, and voice acting. Roach knew his Trailer Park Boys co-stars since before they started acting. Roach was a partner early on in a pizza chain in Prince Edward Island called J.R. Capone's run by John Paul Tremblay and Robb Wells. Roach played the role of Randy, the assistant trailer park supervisor. He mainly appeared shirtless with a large belly throughout the entire series and had an on-again, off-again relationship with supervisor Jim Lahey. When his co-star John Dunsworth died, Roach decided to travel Canada on a stand-up comedy show called Randy's Cheeseburger Picnic. Roach also hosts his own series called The Roach Approach on SwearNet. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Canadian comedians Category:Canadian movie actors Category:Canadian television actors Category:Canadian voice actors",
