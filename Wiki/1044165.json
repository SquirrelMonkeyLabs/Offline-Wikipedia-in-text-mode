 "text": "Before Islam started, there was slavery. Muhammad and his successors used slaves, and did not change slavery much. They also used slaves as concubines. The work that slaves did, and the trading of slaves was important in Islamic society. In the 19th century, under the influence of colonialism, slavery was gradually abolished. Despite this, there are some conditions resembling slavery which continue to exist in some predominantly Muslim countries. With the abolition of slavery, all Muslim countries have signed documents abolishing it. Some jihadist organizations continue to practice it, though. Category:Slavery Category:Islam",
