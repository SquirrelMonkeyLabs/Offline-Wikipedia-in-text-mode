 "text": "On March 11, 2016, the Donald Trump presidential campaign cancelled a planned rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), in Chicago, Illinois, due to \"growing safety concerns\" due to the protest of thousands of protesters in and outside his rally. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters responding to civic leaders' and social media calls to shut the rally down had gathered outside the arena, and several hundred more filled seating areas within the UIC Pavilion, where the rally was to take place. When the Trump campaign announced that the rally would not take place, there was a great deal of shouting and a few small fights between Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters. Trump blamed Senator Bernie Sanders Sanders for the clashes in Chicago. He said that the protesters were \"Bernie's crowd\" and that a protester who charged the stage at an event in Dayton, Ohio the following day was a \"Bernie person\", calling on Sanders to \"get your people in line.\" Sanders later called out Trump as a \"pathological liar\" who leads a \"vicious movement\", and said that \"while I appreciate that we had supporters at Trump's rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests.\" ==References== Category:Donald Trump Category:Bernie Sanders Category:2016 in Chicago Category:2010s protests",
