It is worn mostly by women, but also by some men and children. Kohl is very ancient, and is seen in depictions of high status women and godesses in Ancient Egypt. It has also been used in India as a cosmetic for a long time. The content of kohl and the recipes to prepare it vary greatly. In North Africa and Middle East, homemade kohl is often made by grinding galena (lead sulfide). In the west, soot or organic charcoal may be used instead of lead. Plant oils and the soot from various nuts, seeds, and gum resins are often added to the carbon powder.Hardy A; Walton R. & Vaishnav R. 2004. Composition of eye cosmetics (kohls) used in Cairo. Int J Environ Health Res. 14(1):83â€“91. Unfortunately, the non-lead products do not give such a good result as the older, traditional varieties. Handmade, lead-based kohl continues to be popular. == References == Category:Cosmetics Category:Antimony Category:Lead Category:Carbon",
