 "text": "The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration from the United States government to a member of its armed forces. Recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Because of these rules, it is often given posthumously (after the recipient has been killed). Of the 3,470 Medals of Honor given , 92 have been given to 90 different African-American recipients.C. W. Hanna, African American recipients of the Medal of Honor, 3; Note: Hanna includes Clement Dees in his count, while this list does not, because Dees's medal was rescinded. Robert Augustus Sweeney is one of nineteen men, and the only African American, to have been awarded two Medals of Honor. A 1993 study by the Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals. At the time, no Medals of Honor had been presented to black soldiers who served in World War II. After an exhaustive review of files, the study recommended that several black Distinguished Service Cross recipients be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans; of these, only Vernon Baker was still alive. ==Civil War== Twenty-five African Americans earned the Medal of Honor during the American Civil War. Included were seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen soldiers of the United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units.C. W. Hanna, African American recipients of the Medal of Honor, 3; Note: Hanna includes Clement Dees in his count, while this list does not, because Dees's medal was rescinded. Fourteen African American men earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four men, all sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake was the first to actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of Honor to be awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after the action in which he earned it. Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.This was very good because of the fact that the African Americans received honor. :Note: Notes in quotations are derived or are copied from the official Medal of Honor citation Image Name Service Rank Unit Place of action Date of action Notes Navy E-01Landsman Mattox Creek, Virginia \"Participating with a boat crew in the clearing of Mattox Creek, L/man Anderson carried out his duties courageously in the face of a devastating fire which cut away half the oars, pierced the launch in many places and cut the barrel off a musket being fired at the enemy.\" Army E-01Private 142nd New York Volunteer Infantry Second Battle of Fort Fisher, North Carolina \"Voluntarily advanced with the head of the column and cut down the palisading.\" Army E-01Private 38th U.S. Colored Infantry Battle of Chaffin's Farm, Virginia \"Among the first to enter the enemy's works; although wounded.\" Army E-08First Sergeant 5th U.S. Colored Infantry Battle of Chaffin's Farm, Virginia \"Took command of his company, all the officers having been killed or wounded, and gallantly led it.\" Navy 0Contraband\"In international law, contraband is any goods carried by vessels of neutral nations during wartime that may be confiscated and thus prohibited from delivery to the enemy.

The four Buffalo Soldier regiments, the 9th Cavalry, 10th Cavalry, 24th Infantry, and 25th Infantry, fought in campaigns throughout the west. The remaining four Medal of Honor recipients were U.S. Army Indian Scouts recruited from among the Black Seminoles, a group of Seminole Indians of African descent. :Note: Notes in quotations are derived or are copied in their entirety from the actual Medal of Honor citation Image Name Service Rank Unit Place of action Date of action Notes Army E-05Sergeant 9th Cavalry Regiment Mimbres Mountains and near Ojo Caliente, New Mexico and \"Bravery in action\" Army E-05Sergeant 24th Infantry Regiment Arizona \"Although shot in the abdomen, in a fight between a paymaster's escort and robbers, did not leave the field until again wounded through both arms.\" Army E-05Sergeant 9th Cavalry Regiment Las Animas Canyon, New Mexico \"Removed a wounded comrade, under a heavy fire, to a place of safety.\" Army E-01Private Indian Scouts Pecos River, Texas \"With 3 other men, he participated in a charge against 25 hostiles while on a scouting patrol.\" Army E-04Corporal 9th Cavalry Regiment Florida Mountains, Luna County, New Mexico \"While part of a small detachment to persuade a band of renegade Apache Indians to surrender, his group was surrounded.

Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died of his wounds, and was shortly afterwards recommended for the Medal of Honor; however, this recommendation was never processed. In 1990, the Department of the Army conducted a review and the Stowers recommendation was uncovered. An investigation was launched, and based on results of the investigation the award of the Medal of Honor was approved. Stowers' Medal of Honor was presented on April 24, 1991—seventy-three years after he was killed-in-action.

This changed in 1992 when a study conducted by Shaw University and commissioned by the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the United States Army asserted that systematic racial discrimination had been present in the criteria for awarding medals during the war. After an exhaustive review of files the study recommended that several of the Distinguished Service Crosses awarded to African Americans be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, more than fifty years after the end of the war, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans. Vernon Baker was the only living recipient—the other six men had been killed in action or died in the intervening years. :Note: Notes in quotations are derived or are copied in their entirety from the actual Medal of Honor citation Image Name Service Rank Unit Place of action Date of action Notes Army O-01Second Lieutenant 370th Infantry Regiment, 92d Infantry Division (Colored) near Viareggio, Italy and Risked his life numerous times to destroy enemy installations, personnel and equipment during his company's attack against a strongly entrenched enemy.

He then crossed the field, using as a shield his two prisoners from whom he obtained valuable information concerning the disposition of enemy troops.

Repeatedly refusing evacuation, Sergeant Rivers continued to direct his tank's fire at enemy positions through the morning of 19 November 1944. At dawn, Company A's tanks began to advance towards Bougaktroff, but were stopped by enemy fire. Sergeant Rivers, joined by another tank, opened fire on the enemy tanks, covering company A as they withdrew. While doing so, Sergeant River's tank was hit, killing him and wounding the crew. Staff Sergeant Rivers' fighting spirit and daring leadership were an inspiration to his unit and exemplify the highest traditions of military service.

Most of the non-combat medals, including both of Sweeney's, were awarded for rescuing or attempting to rescue someone from drowning. :Note: Notes in quotations are derived or are copied in their entirety from the actual Medal of Honor citation Image Name Service Rank Unit Place of action Date of action Notes Navy Ship's Cook First Class aboard ship at sea Attempted to save the life of an officer who fell overboard at sea Navy E-01Ordinary Seaman Toulon, France \"Jumping overboard, Davis rescued Augustus Ohlensen, coxswain, from drowning\" Navy E-01Seaman aboard ship at sea \"[F]earlessly exposing his own life to danger for the saving of others\" Navy E-01Seaman near Greytown, Nicaragua \"[D]isplayed great coolness and self- possession at the time Comdr.
