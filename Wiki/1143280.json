 "text": "Concavenator is a large, sail-backed, meat-eating theropod from prehistoric Spain. It roamed this place during the Early Cretaceous period. Some scientists believed it may have been a signal device or even a feature to attract female Concavenators. The scientific name of this species is Concavenator corcovatus. ==Features== This beast had a huge hump on its back shaped like a sword. It had been thought for centuries that this species was a spinosaurid. But fossil records show it was an allosaurid, a type of theropod dinosaur. ==Popular culture== Concavenator has not appeared in many pop culture for long times of debating. The only evidence we know of Concavenator is that it was thought to be an addition to the film Jurassic Park, but instead, it is inactive in both Isla Nublar and Isla Sorna. The species had an inactive appearance in the toy stop-motion series Saurian Isle, in which, during its long active appearance in this series' special called Unseen Horrors, it was depicted as capable of killing other dinosaurs and eating them. Concavenator also made its inactive appearance in the novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. ==Gender== The genders of Concavenator are probably both males and females.
