Wushu has become an international sport through the International Wushu Federation (IWUF). The IWUF holds the World Wushu Championships every two years. The first World Championships were held in 1991 in Beijing. Competitive wushu is made up of two disciplines: taolu (套路; forms) and sanda (散打; sparring).International Wushu Federation. Wushu Sport . Taolu involves martial arts routines. These are judged and given points according to specific rules on quality and difficulty of movements. The movements could be stances, kicks, punches, balances, jumps, sweeps and throws. Competitive forms have time limits that can range from 1 minute, 20 seconds to over five minutes. Modern wushu competitors practice jumping techniques such as 540 and 720 and even 900 degree jumps and kicks. Sanda (sometimes called sanshou or Lei tai) is a modern fighting method and sport. It was influenced by traditional Chinese boxing, Chinese wrestling and Chinese grappling. Sanda has all the combat features of wushu. Sanda is similar to kickboxing or Muay Thai, but it involves more grappling techniques. Sanda competitions are often held alongside taolu competitions. == References == == Books == * Mastering WUSHU by Jiang Bangjun and Emilio Alpanseque, . * Fundamentals of High Performance Wushu: Taolu Jumps and Spins by Raymond Wu, . * Kung Fu Elements , Liang, Shou-Yu and Wu, Wen-Ching, == Other websites == * International Wushu Federation – Official Website * The Web's Most Comprehensive Wushu Site Covering the Beijing Wushu Team, US Wushu and Wushu in the Olympics.
