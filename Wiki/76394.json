 "text": "The Tatra Mountains, Tatras or Tatra (Tatry in both Slovak and Polish), constitute a mountain range which forms a natural border between Slovakia and Poland. They occupy an area of 750 km², the major part (600 km²) of which lies in Slovakia. The highest Tatra peak, at 2655 m, is Gerlachovský štít, located in Slovakia. Rysy, at 2499 m, is the highest Polish peak. The Tatra Mountains are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. Although considerably smaller than the Alps, they are classified as having an alpine landscape. Their high mountain character, combined with great accessibility, makes them popular with tourists and scientists. == Bibliography == Ján Lacika, Tatras (2nd edition), Bratislava 2006. == Other websites == * Town of Vysoké Tatry – municipal website * Zakopane – municipal website * TANAP – Slovak Tatra National Park * TPN – Polish Tatra National Park === Commercial tourism-oriented websites === * Tatry.cz – travel guide (mainly Slovak side) * Go-Zakopane.com – travel guide (mainly Polish side) === Mountaineering === * Tatry on ogdos.com – mountaineer's notes === Photography === * Atypical images of the Tatras * Spherical panoramas * Panoramic view from Rysy (2499 m) ==== Movies ==== * Ski movie filmed in 1930 Category:Mountain ranges of the Carpathians Category:Geography of Poland Category:Geography of Slovakia",
