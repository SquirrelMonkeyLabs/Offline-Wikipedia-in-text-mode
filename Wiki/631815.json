Dharius and Babo join Artilleria Pesada and record an album in which great international rappers like El Meswy (One of the best rappers in Spain) took part but in spite of all the production, the record never came out light due to reasons still unknown. In 2002, Dharius is invited by Babo as a supporter in the tour of the first album of Cartel de Santa. Dharius accepts and begins to travel throughout Mexico with this group. In 2003, Cartel de Santa is invited to participate with a song in the tribute to the great Mexican singer-songwriter José Alfredo Jiménez titled \"XXX\", the group accepts and Babo invites Dharius to collaborate with them in the reissue of the song \"Ella\". This would be the second recording of Dharius with Cartel de Santa (He had already collaborated with them in the song Super MC's, included in the first self-titled album of the group) and would also be the song with which, a few months later, the group would win his first gold record for its high sales.. == Albums == === Cartel de Santa === * Cartel de Santa (2002) * Vol.II (2004) * Volumen Prohibido (2006) * Vol.IV (2008) * Sincopa (2010) * Me Atizo Macizo tour 2012 en vivo desde el D.F. === Solo === * Directo Hasta Arriba (2014) * Mala Fama, Buena Vidha (2018) == References == Category:Mexican rappers Category:1984 births",
