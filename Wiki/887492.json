The fact is that in the early 1900s the perception of the physical world was completely transformed and artists absorbed these discoveries. There are countless examples in the history of art demonstrating that when the knowledge we have of the surrounding world changes, the way of representing it inevitably changes in turn. It was discovered that the space between bodies is crossed by invisible forces: electromagnetism, heat, light, all elements that the futurists introduced into their works. Garau finds the solution to the problem of understanding space and its representation of its relationship with the subject that occupies it, which has always been one of the crucial points of modern art. Since the time of the Historical Avant-gardes, the space of the painting became the field of experimentation. ==Related pages== * International Exhibition of Nothing * Io sono (artwork) * Comedian (artwork) == References == == Bibliography == * Aldo Quinti, Duchamp Invisible, Officina edizioni, 1975. == Other websites == * * Video \"The Invisible on Display in Milan\", 2015, Video * \"From Zero to Nothing: Piero Manzoni in Comparison\" * Category:Sculptures Category:Conceptual art Category:2021 works Category:2020s in art Category:Salvatore Garau Category:Italian artists Category:Contemporary art Category:Installation art",
