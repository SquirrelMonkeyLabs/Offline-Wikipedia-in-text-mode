 "text": "The Magic Tour was the biggest and last tour by the English rock band Queen with their lead singer Freddie Mercury. The tour started in Sweden on 7 June 1986. It ended in England on 9 August 1986. The next band's tour Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour began about 19 years later, after the death of Freddie Mercury and the retirement of John Deacon. The tour included performances on 26 dates at Europe's stadiums. It was in support of their album A Kind of Magic. In 1987, Mercury was diagnosed with HIV. The band made the decision together to stop touring. This made the concert at Knebworth on 9 August the last time the four members of Queen would perform onstage together. ==Tour dates== Date City Country Venue 7 June 1986 Stockholm Sweden Råsunda Stadium 11 June and 12 June 1986 Leiden Netherlands Groenoordhallen 14 June 1986 Paris France Hippodrome de Vincennes 17 June 1986 Brussels Belgium Forest National 19 June 1986 Leiden Netherlands Groenoordhallen 21 June 1986 Mannheim Germany Maimarktgelände 26 June 1986 West Berlin Germany Waldbühne 28 June and 29 June 1986 Munich Germany Olympiahalle 1 July and 2 July 1986 Zurich Switzerland Hallenstadion 5 July 1986 Slane Ireland Slane Castle 9 July 1986 Newcastle England St. James Park 11 July and 12 July 1986 London England Wembley Stadium 16 July 1986 Manchester England Maine Road 19 July 1986 Koln Germany Müngersdorfer Stadion 21 July and 22 July 1986 Vienna Austria Stadthalle 24 July 1986 Warsaw Poland Stadion Dziesięciolecia 25 July 1986 Katowice Poland Spodek 27 July 1986 Budapest Hungary Népstadion 30 July 1986 Fréjus France Amphitheatre 1 August 1986 Barcelona Spain Mini Estadi 3 August 1986 Madrid Spain Rayo Vallecano 5 August 1986 Marbella Spain Estadio Municipal 9 August 1986 Stevenage England Knebworth Park Category:Queen (band) Category:Concert tours Category:1986 in Europe",
