 "text": "Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game for the Nintendo GameCube game console. It was developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. It was released in North America on September 23, 2002, in Japan on September 27, 2002, and in Europe on November 22, 2002. It was Rare's last game for a Nintendo console before they were bought by Microsoft as a developer for their Xbox console. The plot centers around Fox McCloud restoring the remote Dinosaur Planet by finding pieces that have broken off of it. Unlike the other Star Fox games, Star Fox Adventures plays as an action-adventure game similar to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Instead of a blaster, Fox uses a staff as his weapon. Fox can find power-ups for his staff that allow it to fire projectiles, freeze enemies, and reach areas that he cannot reach on his own. Fox cannot jump unless he runs off of something, in the same way that Link jumps in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
