With 1972's Attica Blues and The Cry of My People, he spoke out for civil rights; the former album was a response to the Attica Prison riots. Shepp was also a professor of African-American Studies at SUNY in Buffalo, New York. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official site * Stewart Smith, \"Archie Shepp interview\", Summerhall, July 31, 2012. * Phil Freeman, \"Interview: Archie Shepp on John Coltrane, the Blues and More\" , Red Bull Music Academy, August 25, 2014. * Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:American saxophonists Category:American pianists Category:American composers Category:American civil rights activists Category:Educators from Florida Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Musicians from Fort Lauderdale, Florida Category:Educators from New York City",
