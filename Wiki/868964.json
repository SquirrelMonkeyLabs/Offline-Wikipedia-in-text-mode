 "text": "Ahmed Sékou Touré (var. Sheku Turay or Ture; January 9, 1922 – March 26, 1984) was a Guinean political leader and African statesman who became the first president of Guinea, serving from 1958 until his death in 1984. In 1960, he declared his Democratic Party of Guinea (Parti démocratique de Guinée, PDG) the only legal party in the state. He ruled from then on as a dictator. He was re-elected unopposed to four seven-year terms since there was no legal opposition. Under his rule many people were killed. In October 2021, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October 1971 massacre, relatives of 70 Guineans executed under the Sékou Touré regime asked President Mamady Doumbouya for rehabilitation and a dignified burial for the victims. ==Other websites== * 1959 Time magazine cover story about Sékou Touré * WebGuinee - Sekou Toure Publishes full text of books and articles as well photos of Sekou Toure * Camp Boiro Memorial.
