Later in 1990, the album peaked at #39 in the United States. Its success came mostly from radio stations playing \"Here's Where the Story Ends\". In late October 1992, the next album, Blind, was released. This album was also successful when it peaked at #103 on the Billboard 200. Blind sold half a million copies. The reviews were positive. Some critics thought the album didn't have the quality songwriting of the first album. In autumn 1997, after five years, their third record, Static & Silence, was released. It got mixed reviews. \"Summertime\", the first song on the album, was their most successful song the UK Charts up to that time.
