 "text": "The Holocene extinction is the extinction of nearly all large mammal species after the end of the ice age. This was done by by humans hunting the animals, and by climate change.Martin P.S. & Klein R.G. (eds) 1984. Quarternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution. Tucson: Arizona University Press. Habitat destruction and over-harvesting are two of the primary causes which drive species extinct in more recent times. The fundamental cause of this is the huge increase in human population since the agricultural revolution. Forests and natural habitats have been greatly reduced throughout the world, and this has been the cause of many extinctions. == References == Category:Animals Category:Extinction events",
