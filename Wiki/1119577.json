It covers all of Guam, an island located in the western Pacific Ocean, and it is the largest and southernmost island in the Mariana Islands archipelago, and was created in 1997. Since Guam is a territory, it does not require +1 before you start typing a phone number. An example would be 314-603-3525, which would be a Missouri phone number. Category:Area codes",
