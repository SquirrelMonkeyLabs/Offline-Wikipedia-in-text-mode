 "text": "The Syrian revolution, also called the Syrian Revolution of Dignity, was a series of protests and uprisings in Syria during the Arab Spring. It began in March 2011 and lasted until mid-2012. Protesters called for the end of the Assad family's rule, which had lasted for decades. == Background == Before the protests, Syria was ruled by President Bashar al-Assad under a strict Ba'ath Party dictatorship. The government limited freedom of speech and arrested critics. Syria was also affected by corruption, poverty, and a severe drought. Protests in other countries during the Arab Spring inspired Syrians to demand change. == The Uprising == Protests began in January 2011 and grew by March. Security forces responded with violence, killing and arresting many people. This led to anger and larger protests. By mid-2011, soldiers were defecting, and opposition militias like the Free Syrian Army formed. The peaceful uprising became an armed conflict, eventually leading to a civil war. == International Reaction == The United Nations and many countries condemned the governmentâ€™s actions. Reports accused the Assad government of using extreme violence, including torture and attacks on civilians. In August 2011, the UN said these acts were crimes against humanity and called for President Assad to face trial. The Syrian Revolution turned into one of the most significant events of the Arab Spring, but it also led to a prolonged and devastating civil war. ==See als== *Arab Spring ==References== Category:2010s riots Revolution",
