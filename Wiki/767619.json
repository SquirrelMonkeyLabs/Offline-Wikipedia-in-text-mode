 "text": "Decode Entertainment was a Canadian production company founded by Steven DeNure, Neil Court, and John Delmage in 1997. It produced kids' shows (animated and live-action). In 2006, Decode Entertainment merged with Halifax Film Company; the result of that merger was the company DHX Media. Decode then became a subsidiary of DHX, gaining distribution rights to Halifax Film shows in the process. In 2010, all DHX companies, including Decode, were rebranded under the DHX name, with distribution transferred to DHX proper. In 2011, DHX Media ceased producing content at the ex-Decode offices. DHX acquired Epitome Pictures in 2014, which assumed the name DHX Studios in 2016, but this company had no relation outside the name. == List of shows == === Live action === * The New Ghostwriter Mysteries (1997) (co-productions with Children's Television Workshop, CBS and M6) * Our Hero (2000–2002) (co-production with Heroic Film Company) * The Zack Files (2000–2002) * The Hoobs (2001–2002) (UK co-production with The Jim Henson Company for Channel 4 and TVOKids) * The Blobheads (2003) * Be the Creature (2003–2004) * Radio Free Roscoe (2003) * Naturally Sadie (2005–2007) * The Latest Buzz (2007–2010) * How to Be Indie (2009–2011) (co-production with Heroic Television Company, YTV, and Sudden Storm) * Waybuloo (2009) (co-production with The Foundation and CBeebies) === Animation === * Freaky Stories (1997–2000) (co-production with Sound Venture Productions, Funbag Animation Studios, and Vujade Entertainment) * Brats of the Lost Nebula (1998) (co-production with Wandering Monkey Entertainment and The Jim Henson Company) * Angela Anaconda (1999–2002) (co-production with C.O.R.E.) * Watership Down (1999–2001) (co-production with Alltime Entertainment) * Weird-Oh's (1999–2001) (co-production with Mainframe Entertainment and EM.TV) * Rainbow Fish (2000) (co-production with EM.TV for Sony Wonder) * Undergrads (2001) (co-production with MTV Animation) * What About Mimi?
