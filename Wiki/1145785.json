 "text": "The Truando rocket frog (Colostethus latinasus) is a frog. It lives in Colombia and Panama. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on mountains in forests that have never been cut down. Scientists saw the frog between 1200 and 1475 meters above sea level. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Parque Nacional Dari√©n. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to streams where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. They say it is not good at living in places that human beings have changed. However, people do not cut down its forest because it is high in the mountains and hard for human beings to go to and because the government of Panama made the forest a park. But people start fires on lower hills, which spread into the mountains. Climate change could hurt this frog because it lives in the mountains. Animals that live in mountains cannot move to colder places because they would have to climb down into warmer places first. Scientists believe the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis killed most of these frogs. B. dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
