 "text": "Paycom Center, formerly known as Ford Center, briefly as Oklahoma City Arena, and Chesapeake Energy Arena, is a multipurpose indoor sports/concert arena in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. It is the home of the National Basketball Association's Oklahoma City Thunder. The arena was also home to the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets from 2005 to 2007. ==Naming history== The arena was named the Ford Center from 2002 to 2010. The name did not come directly from the Ford Motor Company; it instead came from a contract with Oklahoma Ford Dealers, a group that represents marketing efforts of the state's Ford dealers. After the city and Oklahoma Ford Dealers could not agree on a new naming rights contract, the arena became Oklahoma City Arena from 2010 to 2011. A new naming rights contract was signed with Chesapeake Energy in 2011, leading to the renaming as Chesapeake Energy Arena. Chesapeake Energy entered into bankruptcy restructuring in 2020, and ended the naming contract the next year. In July 2021, Paycom, an Oklahoma City-based payroll services company, signed a 15-year naming contract, leading to the current name of Paycom Center. == References == ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Oklahoma City Thunder Category:Sports buildings in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Oklahoma Category:1999 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Oklahoma",
