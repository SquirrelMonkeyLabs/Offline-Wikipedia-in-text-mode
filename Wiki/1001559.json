 "text": "Gayus Halomoan Partahanan Tambunan or commonly called Gayus Tambunan (born May 9, 1979) is a former civil servant at the Directorate General of Taxes, Ministry of Finance of Indonesia. He was known when Komjen (Pol) Susno Duadji said that Gayus kept rupiah gope money in his bank account, plus foreign money worth Rp. 60 billion and jewelery worth Rp. 14 billion in a bank safe on behalf of his wife, all of which were suspected of being illicit assets. In further developments, Gayus had fled to Singapore with his wife and children before being picked up again by the Legal Mafia Task Force in Singapore. The Gayus case tarnished the process of tax reform at the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia, which at that time was being intensively rolled out by Sri Mulyani and at the same time destroyed the image of the Indonesian tax apparatus. == Family == Gayus grew up and was born in Warakas, North Jakarta. He is the second of five children, son of Amir Syarifuddin Tambunan. Gaius is married to Milana Anggraeni and has five children. Milana herself is suspected of having received Rp 3.6 billion from Gaius Tambunan's account. It is known that there were five transfers of funds to Milana's account, between 4 December 2009 to 11 January 2010.http://hariansib.com/?p=117094 ==Related pages== * StopBayarPajak * Rafael Alun Trisambodo * Tax resistance in Indonesia == Referensi == == Other websites == * Kasus gayus bikin orang malas bayar pajak * Kisah Cinta Gayus * Polis kejar Milana istri Gayus * Foto mirip Gayus di Paspor Sony Laksono (dennyindrayana) on Twitter Category:1979 births Category:Living people",
