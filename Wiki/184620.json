He served as governor of Rhode Island (1866-1869) and U.S. Senator from Rhode Island. As a Union Army general in the American Civil War, he fought successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee but was defeated in the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle of the Crater. Burnside commanded the IX Corps, the Department of Ohio, and also the Army of the Potomac for a few months. His distinctive style of facial hair is now known as sideburns, derived from his last name. == References == Category:1824 births Category:1881 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Indiana Category:American Civil War generals Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:United States senators from Rhode Island Category:Governors of Rhode Island Category:Military people from Indiana",
