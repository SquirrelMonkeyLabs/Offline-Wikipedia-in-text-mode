 "text": "Luminator Bernocchi is a type of floor lamp. It was designed by the architect Luciano Baldessari on the idea of Antonio Bernocchi. The Italian entrepreneur Antonio Bernocchi commissioned the lamp. Bernocchi's main business was making textiles. He wanted a lamp which could light the fabrics on display without burning them. The lamp is made from metal. Its design was influenced by Futurism. The prototype was presented in 1929, first in the Bernocchi Pavilion at the Milan Fair and then in the Italian Pavilion at the International Expo in Barcelona.CASVA (Centre for High Studies in the Visual Arts). \"Luciano Baldessari\" .
