He then worked as a professor of sociology at Umeå University until 1969 until he returned to the previous university as a professor of sociology until 1972. Since 1972 he became a professor of social policy and continues to do so until then. At the beginning, als anys siixanta, Korpi who was at the Institute of Military Psychology is going to focus above all on the attitudes and the welfare of the exèrcit. The publication Social Pressures and Attitudes in Military Training stands out, the thesis that is going to present what it is worth to license in 1962 in sociology. From the anys setanta, it is going to focus mainly on labor disputes and classes and, to a lesser extent, assistance research. == Publications == * The Paradox of Redistribution and Strategies of Equality: Welfare State Institutions, Inequality and Poverty in the Western Countries ”(with Joakim Palme).
