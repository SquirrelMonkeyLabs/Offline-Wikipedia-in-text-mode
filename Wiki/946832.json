 "text": "La Malinche (1500-1550) or Malintzin or Marina was an American Indian woman from the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula. In 1519, Hernán Cortés chose her as a slave with 19 other women. She became the direct helper and translator for Cortés. She knew both Mayan and Nahuatl of the region and learned Spanish. She was important in negotiations. With Malinche, Cortés could interpret the language of the Aztecs. Malinche was eventually baptized as Doña Marina. Cortés used Malinche to find the weaknesses of the Aztecs and to destroy them. This included the fall of Tenochtitlán. == References == Category:1500 births Category:1550 deaths Category:16th century in Spain Category:Colonialism Category:Native American people",
