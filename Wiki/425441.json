 "text": "The Battle of Berlin was the British bombing raid on Berlin during the Second World War from November 1943 to March 1944. British bombers had new navigation aids to help them, such as the new H2S radar, and Bomber Command made 16 attacks on the city. Although the bombings were mostly done by British bombers, Australian and Canadian bombers also flew to Germany. The Battle of Berlin was considered a failure for the Royal Air Force (RAF). It lost 1,047 bombers, with 1,682 more damaged, and over 7,000 air crew members. Also, the bombings did not cause the Germans to give up but left 450,000 of them homeless.
