 "text": "The Bogeyman, otherwise known as the Werebogey, is a mythical ghostly bogey/human hybrid that punishes children for misbehavior. This creature exists in the cultures of most European countries. Its undefined appearance makes it more terrifying. In Germany, he is known as Schwarze Mann (Black Man). He lives under the children bed, in the night forest and in the wardrobe. In Germany the tag game Black Man is very popular. A similar game is British Bulldog. == References == Category:Legendary creatures Category:Monsters Category:Demons Category:Fairies",
