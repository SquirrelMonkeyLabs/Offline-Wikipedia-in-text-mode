 "text": "South African braille is a written language. It is a form of braille. It is a way of putting bumps on paper so blind people can read words with their fingertips. Eleven languages are official in South Africa. Each of these languages is also written in Braille. English is written in Unified English Braille. The other languages use a basic Latin alaphabet, but they add diacritics. Punctuation is the same as in English braille. ==References== Category:Braille Category:South Africa",
