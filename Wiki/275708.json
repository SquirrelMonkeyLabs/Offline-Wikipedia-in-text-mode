It does not use the jazzy sounds and the rapping of Tricky, similar to what Massive Attack did in Blue Lines and Protection. Mezzanine has a dark sound, heavy bass guitars and distorted guitars. This is similar to industrial music and post-punk. Mezzanine had the number one spot on many music charts. It did this on music charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand. It is Massive Attack's best selling album. The album had four singles: \"Risingson\", \"Teardrop\", \"Angel\" and \"Inertia Creeps\".
