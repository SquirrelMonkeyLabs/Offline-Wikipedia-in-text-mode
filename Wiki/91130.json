 "text": "John Lee Hooker (August 22, 1917 – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter born in Coahoma County near Clarksdale, Mississippi. == Biography == === Early life === Hooker was born on August 22, 1917There is some debate as to the year of Hooker's birth. 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been given.(Boogie Man, p. 22) 1917 is the one most commonly cited, although Hooker himself claimed, at times, 1920, which would have made him \"the same age as the recorded blues\" (p. 59) in Coahoma County near Clarksdale, Mississippi. He was born to William Hooker and Minnie Ramsey and was the youngest of eleven children. He and his siblings were home-schooled and they were only allowed to listen to religious songs. His parents separated in 1921 and his mother married William Moore, a blues singer the next year. Moore introduced Hooker to the guitar. John would later credit Moore for his distinctive playing style. === Later life === All through the 1930s, Hooker lived in Memphis where he worked on Beale Street and sometimes performed at house parties. In 1948, he started working at Ford Motor Company. === Career === Hooker's early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. John Lee Hooker rarely played on a standard beat, changing tempos to fit the songs. This made it nearly impossible to add backing tracks. === Pop culture === Hooker appeared and sang in the 1980 movie The Blues Brothers. He recorded over 100 albums. In 1989, he played with Keith Richards, Carlos Santana and Bonnie Raitt to record The Healer and won a Grammy Award. Hooker recorded lots of songs with Van Morrison, including \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\", \"The Healing Game\" and \"I Cover the Waterfront\". ==Death== He fell ill just before a tour of Europe in 2001 and died soon afterwards at the age of 83. The last song Hooker recorded before his death, is \"Ali D'Oro\". == Quotes == *\"It don't take me no three days to record no album.\" (during the recording of the double album Hooker 'N Heat with Canned Heat.) *\"I don't play a lot of fancy guitar. I don't want to play it. The kind of guitar I want to play is mean, mean licks.\" (when describing his own music in an article from The Daily News, Atlanta, Ga. 1992) *\"Women are like wet bars of soap. Hold on to em too hard and they pop outta your hands.\" (as spoken to Randy Wilkinson in New Orleans 1983, friend and road manager) == Albums == 1950s 1950s 1950s Year Album Label / Notes 1959 How Long Blues released on United 1959 I'm John Lee Hooker Vee Jay Records 1959 The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker Riverside Records 1959 Burning Hell Riverside 1960s 1960s 1960s 1960 Travelin Vee Jay Records 1960 That's My Story Riverside 1960 House Of The Blues Chess Records 1960 Blues Man 1960 The Blues Crown Records 1960 John Lee Hooker Sings The Blues King Records 1961 I'm John Lee Hooker Galaxy Records 1961 Plays And Sings The Blues Chess 1961 The Folk Lore of John Lee Hooker Vee Jay 1962 John Lee Hooker Sings The Blues Crown 1962 Burnin' Vee Jay 1962 Live At Sugar Hill Galaxy 1962 Folk Blues Crown 1962 The Best of John Lee Hooker Vee Jay 1962 Drifting the Blues 1962 Tupelo Blues 1963 Don't Turn Me from Your Door: John Lee Hooker Sings His Blues Atco Records 1963 The Big Soul of John Lee Hooker Vee Jay 1963 John Lee Hooker On Campus Vee Jay 1963 The Great John Lee Hooker Crown 1964 John Lee Hooker At Newport Vee Jay 1964 Burning Hell 1964 Great Blues Sounds 1964 I Want to Shout the Blues 1964 The Great John Lee Hooker Japan only 1965 Hooker & The Hogs 1966 It Serves You Right to Suffer 1966 The Real Folk Blues Chess 1967 Live at Cafè Au Go-Go 1968 Hooked on Blues 1969 Get Back Home 1969 If You Miss Ìm ...
