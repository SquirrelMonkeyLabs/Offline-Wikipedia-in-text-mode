 "text": "Induced pluripotent stem cells are a kind of stem cell. Shinya Yamanaka discovered them in 2007 at Kyoto University. They are often called iPS cells. iPS cells are a kind of adult stem cell. They are made from cells from the bodies of adults. This is different to embryonic stem cells which are taken from human embryos. Yamanaka's lab was able to take ordinary body cells, and make them become pluripotent. Being pluripotent means that they can become any other kind of cell. In other words, they can become any kind of cell like embryonic stem cells, but do not need to be taken from human embryos.Takahashi K, Yamanaka S. 2006. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors. Cell 126 (4): 663â€“76. Yamanaka was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize with Sir John Gurdon \"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent\". == References == Category:Cell biology",
