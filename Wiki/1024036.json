 "text": "A crossover SUV, crossover utility vehicle, or CUV is a type of SUV that is based on a unibody structure. These cars are usually lighter than heavier body-on-frame SUVs. The term was first used on the 1979 'AMC Eagle', and the first modern example is the 1994 Toyota RAV4. Unlike general SUVs that are usually all-wheel drive, or four-wheel drive, crossovers tend to also have an option of all-wheel, rear-wheel, or front-wheel drive. Vehicles in this segment are usually based on a car/unibody platform, typically used on sedans, station wagons, and hatchbacks. Since the late 2010s, crossovers have started replacing minivans. ==Advantages== CUVs have three advantages over SUVs: * CUVs are often lighter than SUVs and therefore offer better fuel efficiency. * CUVs are lower to the ground than SUVs, are safer, and have better road handling. * CUVs are generally cheaper to produce.
