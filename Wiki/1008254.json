 "text": "Haplogroup R1a1 (Y DNA) In genetics, the Haplogroup R1a1 (M17) is a Y chromosome haplogroup, which is distributed across Greater Asia or (Eurasia). This group is common in Europe, North Central Asia and India. In Europe, the highest concentrations are in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Ukraine, where half of all males belong to this haplogroup. High concentrations are also present in Northern Europe and it is believed that the Vikings spread it throughout the rest of Europe, including the British Isles. The first carriers of the R1a1 haplotype may have been the Proto-Indo-European nomads in Ukraine about 5,000 years ago. In the context of the kurgan hypothesis, it is associated with the spread of the Indo-European languages. In India, the highest concentrations of R1a can be found in the Brahmins. The studies point to an Aryan migration dating back to before 1500 B.C. The average frequency across all castes of the R1a haplogroup is approximately 40%. In Europe a high concentration of this Lineage be found in Roma people https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/r1a1a-conquers-the-worldin-a- few-pulses ==References== Category:Chromosomes Category:DNA",
