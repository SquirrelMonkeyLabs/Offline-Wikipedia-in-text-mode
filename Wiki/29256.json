 "text": "Sterilisation (which some people spell sterilization) is a process that makes animals or humans unable to reproduce.

But it has often been done against the will of a person. This is called \"compulsory sterilisation\". == Related pages == * Sterilization (microbiology) Category:Biological reproduction",
