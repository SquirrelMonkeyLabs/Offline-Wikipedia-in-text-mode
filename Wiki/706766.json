 "text": "The Type 92 heavy machine gun was the main machine gun used by the Japanese military during World War II. Its heavy weight and slow rate of fire made it a very accurate machine gun. However, its heavy weight also made it impossible to use on the offensive, since it needed to be carried by several soldiers. Also, the bullets needed to be oiled before loading the gun, and not doing so could cause the gun to jam. It fired 30 round belt clips loaded on the side. US soldiers called it the \"woodpecker\" because it sounded like one from far away. Category:Machine guns",
