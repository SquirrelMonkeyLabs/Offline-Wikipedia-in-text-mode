 "text": "Sexual harassment is bullying, coercing or making threats of sexual natures toward other people. The behavior is not appropriate and in some circumstances it is illegal. Ranges of behavior go from seemingly minor annoyances to actual sexual abuse, psychological abuse or assault. For most businesses, the prevention of sexual harassment and defending employees and others from sexual harassment has become a key goal for legal decision-making. The phrase appeared in print in a 1972 issue of The Globe and Mail newspaper published in Toronto.Hugh Gardner, \"..and every prisoner an unprintable word,\" The Globe and Mail, 18 March 1972, p. 35.

Revised and republished as \"The minutiae of discrimination: the need for support,\" in Forisha, Barbara and Barbara Goldman, Outsiders on the Inside, Women in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, New Jersey 1981, pp. 155–171. .
