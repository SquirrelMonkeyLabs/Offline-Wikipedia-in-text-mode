 "text": "The National Congress of Brazil is the national parliament of Brazil. It is bicameral. The two chambers are the Chamber of the deputies (Câmaras dos deputados) and the Senate (Senado). The president of the senate is also the president of the National Congress. The National Congress was created in 1825. The chamber of the deputies has 344 deputies elected for a 4-years term and is ruled by a president (presidente). The senate has 81 senators (3 by state) elected for a 8-years term and is ruled by a president (presidente). The headquarters of the National Congress are in the plaza of the three powers (praça dos três poderes). On 8 January 2023, supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed and invaded the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília, taking over the offices of the Supreme Federal Court, National Congress of Brazil and the Palácio do Planalto. The event was seen as an attempted coup d'état to overturn the election results of the 2022 general election. ==References== Brazil Brazil Brazil Category:Government of Brazil Category:1825 establishments in South America Category:19th-century establishments in Brazil",
