Hardy, aged 70 was a famous English mathematician. He investigated number theory and mathematical analysis. Hardy's classic text A course of pure mathematics was first published in 1908 and has been in print ever since. He wrote A Mathematician's Apology in 1940.G.H. Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology, Cambridge University Press (1940). 153 pages. . In 1908, unable to explain how a dominant gene would not become ubiquitous in a population, Reginald Punnett introduced his problem to Hardy, with whom he played cricket. Hardy went on to formulate what became known as the Hardy–Weinberg law.Edwards A.W.F. 2008. G.H. Hardy (1908) and Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium. Genetics, 179, 1143–1150. Hardy had a long collaboration with J.E. Littlewood, which resulted in a partial solution to a famous unsolved problem in number theory: :\"There are infinitely many primes p such that p+2 is also prime\". Hardy discovered the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was a brilliant student. Hardy saw his extraordinary intelligence and they worked together on many mathematical subjects. In an interview given to Paul Erdős, Hardy said that the discovery of Ramanujan was his (Hardy's) greatest contribution to mathematics and that their collaboration was \"the one romantic incident in my life\". ==Related pages== *Taxicab number ==References== Category:English mathematicians Category:1877 births Category:1947 deaths Category:British number theorists",
