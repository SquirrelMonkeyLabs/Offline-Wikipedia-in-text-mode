 "text": "The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party (SFF) is an agrarian and conservative political party in Australia. ==History== The party was created in 1992 as the Shooters Party. Originally it was only active in New South Wales, but it later spread to other states and territories as well as federal politics. In 2009, it was renamed the Shooters and Fishers Party. It was renamed to its current name in 2016. The party currently has two seats in the New South Wales Legislative Council and one in the Victorian Legislative Council. It has previously elected one member to the Western Australian Legislative Council (who did not get re-elected) and three to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (who all became independents). ==Policies== As the name suggests, the party supports more gun rights and farming. It also focuses on regional and rural issues, healthcare and law and order (including tougher sentences for people who use guns for the wrong reasons). ==References== Category:Political parties in Australia",
