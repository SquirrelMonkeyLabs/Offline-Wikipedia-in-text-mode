 "text": "Longue paume is an outdoor version of jeu de paume and therefore an ancestor of modern lawn tennis. Hundreds of years ago it was quite popular, particularly in France. It was part of the Paris 1900 Summer Olympics, but not all think that the medals that were awarded for longue paume at that Olympics have full value. Today, the sport is played regionally in Picardie. The governing body of the sport is the Fédération Française de Longue Paume with its headquarter in Amiens. ==Other websites== * Connaissez-vous la Longue Paume? * Ligue de Picardie de Longue Paume Category:Handball",
