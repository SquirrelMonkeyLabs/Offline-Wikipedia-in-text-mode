 "text": "Following the breaking down of the U.S.S.R, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up into Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Slovenia, and Montenegro. Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia claimed independence in 1991, Bosnia in 1992. This left Serbia and Montenegro in a Yugoslav federation, and it resulted in bloody conflicts. The UN sent military forces to the area in 1992, NATO did the same in 1993. The U.S. got directly involved via economic sanctions, and contributed to the peace agreement in 1995. In 1998 followed another bloody conflict as Kosovo, a province of Serbia, wanted greater autonomy. A peace agreement was reached in June 1999. In 2003, Yugoslavia changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro claimed independence in 2006. In 2008 Kosovo independence in 2008. == References == Category:History of Yugoslavia",
