 "text": "Fear of needles (medically known as Belomophobia) is a term used to describe a large fear (phobia) of medical procedures involving needles. In medical litererature it is usually called needle phobia. Other terms used include aichmephobia and belanophobia, but these can also refer to a more general fear of sharply pointed objects. The condition was recognised as a phobia in 1994. It is estimated that at least 10% of American adults have a fear of needles, and it is likely that the actual number is larger, as the most severe cases are never documented due to the tendency of the sufferer to avoid all medical treatment. == References == Category:Phobias",
