 "text": "Kenwood, one of Chicago's 77 community areas. It is on the shore of Lake Michigan on the South Side of the city. Its boundaries are 43rd Street, 51st Street, Cottage Grove Avenue, and the lake. Kenwood was originally part of Hyde Park Township, which was annexed to the city of Chicago in 1889. Kenwood was once one of Chicago's most richest and well-known neighborhoods, and it still has some of the largest single-family homes in the city. It has two Chicago Landmark districts, Kenwood and North Kenwood. A large part of the southern half of the community area is in the Hyde Park-Kenwood Historic District. In recent years, Kenwood has received national attention as the home of U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. ==References== Category:Community areas of Chicago",
