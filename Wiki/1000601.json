In 2019: * 26% of the population over 16 had a \"chronic illness or health problem\". * 18% of the population over 16 had \"limited activity\", of which 6.6% were \"strongly limited\" and 13.0% were \"limited\". * A fifth of persons aged 45-54 years provided care to another person at least once a week. == References ==",
