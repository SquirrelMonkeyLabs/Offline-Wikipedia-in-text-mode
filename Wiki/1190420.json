She had her own court, probably acted as a landholder and held a prominent secular role as regent. Contemporary Greek and Roman sources treated it, incorrectly, as a name. The name Candace is derived from the way the word is used in the New Testament (). A kandake who ruled in her own right bore in addition the title qore, the same title carried by male rulers., pp. 213–214. ==List of ruling kandakes== At least eleven kandakes also ruled in their own right as monarchs (i.e. queen regnants) of Kush: * Nahirqo (middle 2nd century BC) * An unknown queen regnant (end of the 2nd–first half of the 1st century BC) * Amanirenas (end of the 1st century BC–beginning of the 1st century AD) *Amanishakheto (early 1st century AD) *Shanakdakhete (first half of the 1st century AD) *Nawidemak (first half of the 1st century AD?) *Amanitore (middle 1st century AD) *Amanikhatashan (middle 2nd century AD?) *Amanikhalika (second half of the 2nd century AD) * (early 4th century) *Amanipilade (mid-4th century) Based on the reading of a single inscription, some lists give two later kandakes named Maloqorebar (266–283 AD) and Lahideamani (306-314 AD). A recently discovered inscription corrects this earlier reading, however, showing that neither was a woman.Claude Rilly (2017), \"New Light on the Royal Lineage in the Last Decades of the Meroitic Kingdom: The inscription of the Temple of Amun at Meroe Found in 2012 by the Sudanese–Canadian Mission\", Sudan and Nubia 21: 144–147 (appendix to \"The Amun Temple at Meroe Revisited\" by Krzysztof Grzymski). == See also == * Kandake of the Sudanese Revolution ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:History of Africa Category:Women in the New Testament Category:Female regents in Africa Category:African queen mothers Category:Queen of Sheba",
