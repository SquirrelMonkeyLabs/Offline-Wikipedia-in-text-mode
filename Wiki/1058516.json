 "text": "The WAGR K class were a total of 24 heavy freight side tank steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1893 to 1964. The K class were built by Neilson & Coy of Glasgow, Scotland from 1893 to 1898 for work on heavy goods trains on the Eastern Railway where upon their arrival they totally outclassed the B, G and later O classes. Some were superheated from 1915 to 1916, and one in 1929 as the Ks class however this was not a great success as by this time they were being used as shunters reducing the economic efficiency. When the F class arrived in 1902 the K class was reallocated to the South Western mainline to Collie, replacing the O class on goods traffic. After handling local goods around Perth and Kalgoorlie along with other regional centres they became relegated to purely shunting roles by the 1920s. The last K class was withdrawn in 1964, all were scrapped. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
