 "text": "An immobilized enzyme is an enzyme that is attached to an inert, insoluble material. This can provide a higher resistance to changes in condition such as pH or temperature. == Commercial use == Immobilised enzymes can be important for commercial uses as they have many benefits to the cost and processes of the reaction such as: * Convenience: small amounts of protein dissolve in the reaction so purification of the product is easier. * Economy: The immobilized enzyme is easily removed from the reaction so it can be recycled. This is useful in the production of lactose-free milk as the milk can be drained from a container leaving the enzyme (lactase) inside for the next batch. * Stability: Immobilised enzymes normally have a higher thermal and operational stability than the soluble form of the enzyme. * Safety: In the past, biological washing powders contained proteases and lipases that would break down dirt but also irritate the skin if it was touched - immobilization prevents this from happening == Methods == * Adsorption on glass: The enzyme is attached to a glass bead. * Covalent bond: The enzyme is bound covalently to a support (such as silica gel). * Cross-linkage: Multiple enzymes are bound together to create a matrix. * Affinity-tag binding: Enzymes attached to a surface with protein tags. == References == Category:Cell biology Category:Enzymes Category:Microbiology Category:Stereochemistry",
