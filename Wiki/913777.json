 "text": "An Alice band is a type of accessory. It is made of flexible plastic or elastic in the shape of a horseshoe. Flexible means that the band can bend. It is designed to fit over the head and hold long hair away from the face, but let the hair hang freely at the back. In the United States, an Alice band is usually called a hair band or a headband. == History == The Alice band first started being worn around 1871, after Lewis Carroll's book Through the Looking-Glass was published. The name of the Alice band comes from the main character in the book, Alice.\"Alice, n.1.\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, March 2019, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4982. Accessed 24 March 2019. In the drawings John Tenniel made for the book, Alice wears a ribbon that keeps her long hair away from her face. The Alice band has sometimes been popular in fashion for young women. In the late 20th century, so-called Sloane Rangers in the United Kingdom wore Alice bands made of velvet. In the past, the Alice band was almost always worn by women. Today, however, men in some countries also wear Alice bands. Both David Beckham and Jack Grealish have worn Alice bands. == References == Category:Headgear",
