 "text": "Itikaf or Etikaf or E'tikaf is a practice in the Islamic faith. It consists of a period of retreat in a mosque, for a certain number of days in accordance with the believer's own wish.That number of days is 10 days. Ramadan is a perfect opportunity to do this. During Itikaf the people spend the last set of Ramadan in the mosque worshipping Allah. They spend their nights in worship by reciting verses from the Qur'an and praying thahajjud. During Itikaf, the believers stay at the mosque. E'tikaf is performed during the last set of Ramadan because \"laylatul qadr\" (the night when the Quran was revealed) is most probably expected in it.The Muslims also worship ALLAH more and reflect about what they have done in the past. Itikaaf is a spiritual practice in Islam where a person secludes themselves in a mosque for a certain period, typically during the last ten days of Ramadan. During this time, the person focuses on prayer, recitation of the Quran, and seeking closeness to Allah. It's considered a time of intense devotion and reflection.
