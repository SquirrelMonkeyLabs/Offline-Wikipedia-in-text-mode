 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Deux-Sèvres department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of Deux-Sèvres are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 791 Bressuire Bressuire 96,703 1,622.6 53 792 Niort Niort 212,425 2,791.6 163 793 Parthenay Parthenay 64,425 1,585.1 77 ==History== Since its creation, the Deux-Sèvres department has had some changes: * 1790 : creation of the department, with six districts: Melle, Niort, Parthenay, Saint-Maixent, Thouars and Châtillon (now Mauléon).
