 "text": "The First Chechen War was a war between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and Russia from 1994 to 1996. ==Battles== The war was caused by Russia's prior attempt to overthrow the Chechen government in the Battle of Grozny in November 1994. The initial campaign of the war saw the deadly First Battle of Grozny. Russia's major military failures during the conflict led to a rise of opposition movements against Russian president Boris Yeltsin. ==Damages== Death estimates for the Russian military in the conflict range anywhere from 3,500 up to 14,000. The war caused massive devastation for the region of Chechnya and neighboring areas of Russia that continues until this day. The conflict also caused a rise of ethnic tensions between Chechens and non- Chechens in Chechnya. == Aftermath == In the aftermath of the First Chechen War, a rise of radical Islamic thought in the form of Jihadism began to rise in Chechnya. This ultimately led to the Chechen Civil War and later the pretext for the Second Chechen War. ==References== Category:1990s conflicts Category:Wars involving Russia Category:1994 in Europe Category:1995 in Europe Category:1996 in Europe Category:1990s in Russia",
