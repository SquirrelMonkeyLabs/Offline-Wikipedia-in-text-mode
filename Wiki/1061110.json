 "text": "The WAGR Ka class were a total of 3 diesel-electric locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1974 to 1995. The Ka class resulted from fitting standard gauge bogies to Ra class locomotives mainly for service on the Coolgardie to Esperance line. Which due to large amounts of salt and nickel traffic was converted to standard gauge. All Ra were withdrawn from 1990 to 1991, with one Ka class lasting in service until 1995. No. 211 is used as a testing unit at UGL Rail's Bassendean plant, while No. 212 was scrapped at Bellevue in 2016. No. 213 was converted back to an Ra class in 1985 (regaining the number 1918), and it is now displayed at the Bassendean Railway Museum. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
