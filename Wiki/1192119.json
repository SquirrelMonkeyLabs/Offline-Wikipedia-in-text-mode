 "text": "Mariana \"Lali\" Espósito (Born, October 10, 1991) is an Argentine actress, singer and composer. ==Biography== Mariana Espósito was born on October 10, 1991, in Buenos Aires. She is the youngest daughter of María José Riera, a medical representative, and Carlos Espósito, a soccer coach. She has two siblings, Ana Laura and Patricio. Espósito is of Italian descent through her great-grandparents. Her nickname was given to her by her brother, thirteen months older than her, who as a child couldn't call her \"Mari\" and began calling her \"Lali\". ==Personal life== ===Political vision=== Following the August 2023 presidential primary elections, Espósito made her stance towards Javier Milei clear on social media: \"How dangerous. How sad,\" she wrote, referring to the results that favored the then-candidate. This statement sparked a media confrontation, as Milei responded that she did not know who he was, which intensified criticism of her from her followers. Espósito also denounced attempts to harm her booking for municipal events and, during the Cosquín Rock festival in the province of Córdoba, changed the lyrics of one of her songs in response to the accusations received. Later, from Italy, Milei shared new negative messages towards Espósito on Twitter, in which she was accused of charging large sums of money for shows in various provinces and of being a \"Kirchnerist militant\", which sparked further criticism of her for supposedly receiving public funds. === Relationships === From 2006 to 2010, Espósito was in a relationship with her Chiquititas and Casi Ángeles co-star Peter Lanzani, whom she called her \"first love\". The couple is still a fan favourite in Argentina and they remained good friends after their breakup. In 2010, Espósito began dating singer and actor Benjamín Amadeo after they met in Casi Ángeles. Espósito and Amadeo announced their breakup in 2015, but they and their families remained close friends, making several public appearances together. From late 2015 to early 2016, Espósito was in a highly publicized relationship with her Esperanza Mía co-star Mariano Martinez. In 2017 Espósito began dating sound engineer Santiago Mocorrea; they broke up in 2020. Since 2024, she has been in a relationship with media personality Pedro Rosemblat. ==References== Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:1991 births",
