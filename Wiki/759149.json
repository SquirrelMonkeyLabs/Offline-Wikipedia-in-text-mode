On 4 February 2020, in order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, South Korea began denying entry to foreigners traveling from Hubei Province. ==Numbers== By 23 September 2020, South Korea had about 23,216 cases and 388 deaths, and by 9 April 2020, with over 494,711 people having been tested. ==Programs== South Korea created what was thought to be one of the largest and best-organised epidemic control programs in the world, along with Taiwan, Vietnam, and Singapore. Different actions have been taken to screen the mass population for the virus, and isolate any infected people as well as trace and quarantine those who contacted them, without further lockdown. The rapid tests taken by South Korea have been successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak, without added a mass quarantine action. ==References== ==Other websites== * COVID-19 South Korean page Category:2020s in South Korea South Korea",
