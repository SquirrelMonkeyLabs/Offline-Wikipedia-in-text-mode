It looks like the 3D projection of a tesseract. The Grande Arche was built when François Mitterrand was president. It was opened on 14 July 1989, 200 years after the French Revolution. The Grande Arche houses different offices of the government. There is a terrace at the top, and a space for exhibitions. Category:Monuments and memorials in France",
