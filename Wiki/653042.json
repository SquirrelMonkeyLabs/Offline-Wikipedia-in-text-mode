 "text": "Ronnie \"Woo Woo\" Wickers (born October 31, 1941) is an American entertainer. He was born in the South Side of Chicago. Wickers is known as a longtime Chicago Cubs fan and local celebrity in the Chicago area. He is known to Wrigley Field visitors for his cheers at baseball games, generally with the shouting of \"Woo!\" (e.g., \"Cubs, woo! Cubs, woo! Big-Z, woo! Zambrano, woo! Cubs, woo!\") Longtime Cubs announcer Harry Caray called Wickers \"Leather Lungs\" because he is able to shout for hours at a time. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Chicago Cubs Category:Entertainers from Chicago",
