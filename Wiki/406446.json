 "text": "A business jet is an aircraft designed and built for transporting a small group of passengers, between four and twenty people. Generally it is a twin- turbojet aircraft, but some are tri-jet (such as Falcon 50), or four-engine (like the Jetstar). In some cases it is even airliners that have been turned into this kind of aircraft, like Airbus A320CJ or Boeing 737BJ. Some business jets are used by air forces for priority and VIP transport. Some are owned by the companies that use them, and some by other companies who provide service for business or private trips. == Examples == === Twin-engine aircraft === * Bombardier Challenger 300 * Cessna CJ-1 * Dassault Falcon 20 * Embraer Phenom * Hawker-Siddeley HS-125 * IAI Astra * Embraer Legacy 600 === Tri-jet aircraft === * Dassault Falcon 50 * Dassault Falcon 900 * Dassault Falcon 7X === Four- engine aircraft === * Lockheed Jetstar == Bibliography == * Stewart Wilson, Airliners of the world, Aerospace Publications Australia, 1999. == Related pages == * Business class ==References== Category:Aircraft",
