A close associate of Chiang Kai-shek, he served previously as foreign minister and as governor of Sichuan. In 1907 he was a classmate of Chiang Kai-shek as a military cadet in Japan. They both went on to serve in the Takata regiment of the Niigata army . This period was to form the basis of the lifelong friendship between the two men. Following the establishment of the Republic of China, Chang was made Head of the Foreign Affairs division. In the aftermath of World War II he was briefly the head of the Executive Yuan, a position also known as Premier of the Republic of China. His later career was chiefly concerned with foreign affairs, paticularly relations with Japan. In 1972, at the age of 83, he played a large role in the difficult negotiations regarding Japan's switch of diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China. ==Other websites== *Biography (Chinese) Chang Ch'ün Chang Ch'ün Chang Ch'ün Category:Chinese politicians Category:Taiwanese politicians Category:20th-century Chinese politicians",
