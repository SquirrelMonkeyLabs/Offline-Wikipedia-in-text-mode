 "text": "The Ceratophryinae, known as common horned frogs, are a subfamily of the leptodactylid frogs. All species live in South America. Fossils of the giant Beelzebufo from Cretaceous Madagascar suggest that the subfamily may have once ranged throughout the prehistoric supercontinent of Gondwana. Not all species in the subfamily have the horn-like growth at the eyes. All are carnivorous, terrestrial or semi-aquatic. They have large heads and mouths. Some people enjoy keeping these frogs as pets. ==Genera== * †Beelzebufo, Evans, Jones, & Krause, 2008. * Ceratophrys, Wied-Neuwied, 1824. * Chacophrys, Reig & Limeses, 1963. * Lepidobatrachus, Budgett, 1899. * Macrogenioglottus, Carvalho, 1946. * Odontophrynus, Reinhardt & Lütken, 1862. * Proceratophrys, Miranda-Ribeiro, 1920. ==References== *http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/names.php?taxon=&family;=&subfamily;=Ceratophryinae&genus;=&commname;=&authority;=&year;=&geo;=0&dist;=&comment;= Category:Frogs of South America Category:Frogs of Africa",
