 "text": "Emergency Alerts is a new public warning system being released in the UK in 2023. Since the US had an Emergency Alert System back in 1997 during peacetime, the UK has never had one. Since 2020, the UK government have been trailing out such a system in parts of the UK like Reading and East Suffolk. The system is a mobile alert system that will work like the WEA system in the US. Every phone will receive an alert with a message, and a dsctintive warning tone, also described as a 'siren-like sound'. The system will alert UK residents about life-threatening emergencies, and terrorists attacks. However, officials who work the system will not discuss how the UK population would be warned in an event of a nuclear attack. The system has been launched in March 2023 with all compatible phones will receive a test message to demonstrate how the system works with the warning tone and vibration on the 23rd April, 2023 at 3pm. == References == Category:United Kingdom Category:Emergency services",
