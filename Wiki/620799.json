It has 106 independently incorporated local groups in the United States and Canada. The main group is in Arlington, Virginia. Almost 400,000 local businesses in North America support BBB. BBB isn't connected to any government agency. BBB has been the subject of controversy. The controversy is mainly related to its alleged practice of giving higher ratings to businesses that pay membership fees. It says that payment from businesses is not required for them to receive an \"A\" rating. ==References== Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States Category:1912 establishments in the United States",
