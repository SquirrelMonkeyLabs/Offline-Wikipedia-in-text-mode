 "text": "A general election was held on 18 June 1970 to elect all 630 members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The Conservative Party won the election and Edward Heath became Prime Minister. Most people thought that the Labour Party would win the election and it was a surprise that the Conservatives won. Opinion polls had showed Labour ahead, but were wrong. This was the first election where people aged over 18 could vote, instead of 21. ==References== Category:1970 in Europe Category:1970s elections in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom general elections",
