 "text": "The Power Mac G5 is a series of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from 2003 to 2006 as part of the Power Mac series. When introduced, it was the most powerful computer in Apple's Macintosh lineup, and was marketed by the company as the world's first 64-bit desktop computer. It was also the first desktop computer from Apple to use an anodized aluminum alloy enclosure, and one of only three computers in Apple's lineup to utilize the PowerPC 970 CPU, the others being the iMac G5 and the Xserve G5. Three generations of Power Mac G5 were released before it was discontinued as part of the Mac transition to Intel processors, making way for its replacement, the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro retained a variation of the G5's enclosure design for seven more years, making it among the longest-lived designs in Apple's history. == References == == Other websites == *Ars Technica: Inside the PowerPC 970 *Ars Technica: A Brief Look at the PowerPC 970 *Ars Technica Review: Power Mac G5 Dual 2.5 GHz *Forevermac.com: The Power Mac G5 Quad Core 2.5 GHz Category:Apple hardware Category:Computer hardware",
