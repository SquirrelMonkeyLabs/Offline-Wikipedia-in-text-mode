 "text": "An early presidential election will be held in South Korea on 3 June 2025. Originally set for 3 March 2027, the election was pushed forward after the impeachment and removal of Yoon Suk Yeol. The date of 3 June is due to the requirement by the country's constitution for an election to be held within 60 days of when the presidency becomes vacant. Since democratization and the creation of the Sixth Republic, this will be the ninth presidential election, the second election after a presidential impeachment, and the first held in a different year than originally scheduled. ==Election events== Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung has had legal troubles that may ban him from being elected president. Under the Public Official Elections act, candidates who receive more than 1 million won in fines or any prison sentence are banned from serving as a public official for 5 and 10 years respectively. In March 23, Seoul High Court reversed a decision made sentencing Lee to one year in prison with a two-year probation, allowing him to run for public office again. However, in May 2, a speedy 10-2 judgement from the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, and sent the case back to Seoul High Court for a retrial. The initial date of retrial was set at May 15, but was later delayed to June 18, which is after the election date. The two leading conservative candidates former Acting President Han Duck-soo and former Labor Minister Kim Moon-soo are expected to merge their campaigns, but made little progress in doing so. Kim has said that the PPP and its chair has moved to unify campaigns without talking with him. A party spokesperson said that it's likely the party would move to remove Moon-soo of his candidacy if he did not agree to unify with Duck-soo. The PPP confirmed early on May 10 that they would cancel the nomination of Kim, and instead nominate Han at an emergency convention the same day. Later that day, members of the PPP rejected a resolution making Han the party's candidate following an all-party vote, resulting in Kim's nomination being reinstated. Han later apologized for the candidacy dispute and withdrew from the election. ==Candidates== ===Democratic Party=== ====Nominee==== Democratic Party Ticket Lee Jae-myung for President Leader of the Democratic Party (2022–2025) ====Withdrawn candidates==== Candidates in this section are sorted by date of withdrawal from the primaries Kim Dong-yeon Kim Kyoung-soo Kim Doo- kwan Governor of Gyeonggi Province (since 2022) Governor of South Gyeongsang Province (2018–2021) Member of the National Assembly (2016–2024) Withdrew: April 19 Withdrew: April 19 Withdrew: April 18 ====Primary results==== The 21st Democratic Party presidential primary election was held on 27 April 2025.
