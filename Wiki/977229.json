 "text": "Roc Nation is an American record label and music publishing company. ==Background== It was reported that Jay-Z, no longer heading Def Jam and coming up on his last album for the company, has already inked a deal with Live Nation to set up an imprint called Roc Nation. Implementing a reportedly redesigned business model, the label serves as management for Wale and Melanie Fiona, and has signed North Carolina rapper J.Cole. It is unknown which artists will be shifted from Roc-A-Fella to Roc Nation. According to The New York Times, Jay-Z is finalizing a deal with concert promoter Live Nation for $150 million, one of the richest contracts ever awarded to a musician. This partnership, which will be named Roc Nation, will include financing for Jay-Z's own entertainment ventures (which are expected to become a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company). Live Nation is expected to contribute $5 million a year in overhead for five years, with another $25 million available to finance Jay-Z's acquisitions or investments. Roc Nation would then split profits with Live Nation. To finalize the deal, Jay-Z will depart from Def Jam Records after he turns in his last required album under his talent contract. Jay-Z will be the first hip-hop artist to sign with Live Nation. ==Signed artists== *Brandy Norwood *J.Cole ==References== Category:Jay-Z Category:2008 establishments in the United States Roc Nation",
