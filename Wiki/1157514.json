 "text": "The dull rocket frog (Allobates marchesianus) is a frog. It lives in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru. Scientists think it could also live in Ecuador. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests that have never been cut down and forests that were destroyed and are growing back. Scientists saw the frog between 0 and 800 meters above sea level. There are many protected parks and protected places where the frog lives. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on land. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Fires and human beings change the places where the frog lives. People cut down trees to get wood to build with and to do other things where the forest used to be. In 2007, scientists found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in an A. marchesianus frog in the Nanay River, but they do not know if the fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a big problem for this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
