 "text": "In photography, the phrase normal lens is used for camera lenses that have a focal length which is roughly the diagonal of the image projected inside the camera. Camera lenses with a shorter focal length are called wide-angle lenses, those with a longer one telephoto lenses. This gives a natural perspective.

The sensor type diameter is not the sensor diameter: : (*) refers to tv-tube diameters that were standards in the 50's. The normal lens focal length is roughly 2/3 of the TV tube diameter. : (**) this is a mathematical calculation because most of the cameras have zoom lenses.

This definition is widely accepted within the cinematography community and reflects the standard used by professionals in the field. ==References== Category:Camera lenses",
