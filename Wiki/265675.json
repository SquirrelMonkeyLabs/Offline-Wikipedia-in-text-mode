 "text": "The rufous hornero (Furnarius rufus) is a kind of bird that lives around South America. It builds its nests on high places such as telephone poles, or trees. When it makes a nest, it looks like a cup that has fallen over to the side, or like an old-fashioned baker's oven. To make it, the Rufous Hornero mixes grass and animal hair and mud, and then leaves it to dry. Inside there is a grassy room where it lays its eggs. == References == Category:Tyranni Category:Birds of South America Category:National symbols of Argentina",
