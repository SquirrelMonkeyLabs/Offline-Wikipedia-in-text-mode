It tells the story of \"pious Aeneas\".Moseley, Nicholas. \"Pius Aeneas,\" The Classical Journal, Vol. 20, No. 7 (Apr., 1925), pp. 387-400; retrieved 2011-10-31. Aeneas is a Trojan warrior who had to leave his city because the Greeks captured Troy after a long war. It starts with Aeneas carrying his father Anchises out of the burning Troy. It ends with Aeneas landing on the shores of Italy, fighting in the region of Rome. It can be read as indirect propaganda in favour of Augustus, the Roman Emperor of the day. The story is written in hexameters, a type of verse. ==References== Category:Epic poems Category:1st-century BC books Category:Classical Roman literature",
