 "text": "In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a temple is a building dedicated to be a House of the Lord. Temples are seen by church members to be the most sacred buildings on earth. Temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time which is called an \"open house\". During the open house, the church has tours of the temple with missionaries being tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a \"House of the Lord\", after which only members are allowed in. Temples are not churches or meetinghouses, but are places of worship open only to the faithful where certain rites of the church must be held. ==References== Category:Mormonism",
