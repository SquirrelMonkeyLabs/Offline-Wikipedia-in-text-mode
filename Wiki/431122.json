For the first time in the series, there were two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero that were added. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 8.5 out of 10. They said, \"For a full-price title, gamers get so much more than mere roster and tuner updates (which come for free and with regularity, by the way). You also get robust online and offline modes that could potentially keep you busy for hundreds of hours.\" GameSpot gave the game a 8 out of 10. They said, \"NHL 13 adds some great new skating physics and smarter AI, although you've already seen a lot of what the game has to offer.\" ==References== Category:2012 video games Category:NHL (video game series) Category:Electronic Arts video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Xbox 360 games",
