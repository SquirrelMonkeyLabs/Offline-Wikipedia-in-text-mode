 "text": "\"No Way to Prevent This', Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens\" is the title of many articles published by the American news satire organization The Onion about the large amounts of mass shootings in the United States and how not a lot is done in the aftermath of these mass shootings. Each article is about 200 words long, and talks about a different shooting. The article talks about the location of the shooting and the number of victims, but usually remains the same as to other articles. A fictional resident, usually of a state in which the shooting did not take place, is quoted as to have said \"a terrible tragedy\", but \"there's nothing anyone can do to stop them\". These articles end by saying that the United States is the \"only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years\" and that many Americans feel helpless as they have gotten used to the mass shootings. ==References== Category:American culture",
