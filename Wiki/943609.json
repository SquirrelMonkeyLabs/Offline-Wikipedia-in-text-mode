 "text": "Left-wing libertarianism is a kind of left-wing politics that says the government should have less control over people's lives. Left-wing libertarians want a mix of personal freedoms with social equality. They normally believe in a more progressive lifestyle than other libertarians. But they agree that people should normally have more free choice. Left-wing anarchism is an extreme kind of left-wing libertarianism. It wants to get rid of government and capitalism entirely. Libertarianism can also sometimes mix with socialism. This is called socialist libertarianism. But these different names can sometimes all mean the same thing. Socialist libertarians and anarchists want to end private property because they believe people who own it get unfair power over others. They want a future based on people working to help each other, instead of for money. But they want to make these things happen without using a government. == Examples == == Related pages == * Human rights * Left-wing liberalism == References == Category:Libertarianism",
