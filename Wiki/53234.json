 "text": "The Bretons are the residents of the region of Brittany in France. Most trace much of their heritage to white people who settled the area from south western Great Britain in the 4th–6th centuries. The region of Brittany is named after them and many speak Brezhoneg, a Brythonic language closely related to Cornish and a bit more distantly to Welsh. The Breton language as such is part of the Insular Celtic language group. In eastern Brittany, a regional langue d'oïl named Gallo developed; it shares certain points of vocabulary, idiom, and pronunciation with Breton. Category:Celtic peoples",
