 "text": "The Mexicools were a professional wrestling tag team and stable that competed on the SmackDown! brand in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2005 until 2006. The members of the stable were Super Crazy, Psicosis, and Juventud. Juventus was later released by the company in 2006. The members of the stable were portrayed as proud Mexicans who were tired of the stereotypes and tired of how Mexicans were used as workers for \"gringoes\". During their entrances, the Mexicools drove to the ring on a pair of \"Juan Deere\" lawn mowers. The group debuted as heels, attacking Chavo Guerrero and Paul London. On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, The Mexicools would defeated Paul London, Funaki and Scotty 2 Hotty in their in-ring debuts. The group would turn into faces after they started to feud with the Full Blooded Italians. At No Mercy, Juventud went on to defeat Nunzio to become the WWE Cruiserweight Champion. He lost the championship back to Nunzio during a house show in Rome. Juventud became a two-time champion after defeating Nunzio on the November 22 episode of SmackDown!. He lost the championship to Kid Kash at Armageddon. Super Crazy and Psicosis also faced MNM at Armageddon but lost. The match was originally for the WWE Tag Team Championships but MNM lost the championships to Batista and Rey Mysterio before the PPV. On January 6, 2006, Juventud was released from the company and the Mexicools became a tag team. On the June 23 edition of SmackDown!, the team broke up after Super Crazy and Psicosis got into a fight. This came after weeks of Psicosis both cheating in matches and leaving Super Crazy to be attacked multiple times. Super Crazy moved to the Raw brand and Psicosis was released from the company after stealing a car at gunpoint in Mexico. == Championships and accomplishments == * World Wrestling Entertainment ** WWE Cruiserweight Championship (2 times) - Juventud ==References== == Other websites == *The Mexicool's Online World of Wrestling profile Category:WWE teams and stables",
