 "text": "A syringe is a tool used by doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. It is a simple pump with a needle at the end. It allows to inject liquids into the bloodstream or the muscle. Many syringes are designed to be used only once. If a syringe is used multiple times, it needs to be serilized before each use, otherwise it is possible to spread diseases.
