 "text": "An icosidodecahedron is a polyhedron (a three-dimensional shape) with 20 (icosi) triangular faces and 12 (dodeca) pentagonal faces. An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical vertices, with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon. As such it is one of the Archimedean solids and more especially, a quasiregular polyhedron. Category:Polyhedra",
