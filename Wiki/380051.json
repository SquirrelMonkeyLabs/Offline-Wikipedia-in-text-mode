 "text": "The Gondoliers; or, The King of Barataria is an operetta in two acts by Gilbert and Sullivan. It is the twelfth of their fourteen operettas. It was first performed at the Savoy Theatre in London on 7 December 1889. It ran for 554 performances. It tells of two gondoliers. One appears to be the heir to the throne of Barataria, but which one? == Origin == After completing The Yeomen of the Guard, Sullivan wanted to leave light opera for more serious music. Gilbert reminded him that light, humorous operas were the source of their great success. Their manager Richard D'Oyly Carte promised Sullivan the opportunity to write a grand opera on the condition that he continue to write the light operas. Sullivan accepted. The grand opera would be Ivanhoe.Brahms, pp. 189-193 == Composition == Gilbert proposed a Venetian setting for the new light opera. Sullivan would have the chance to write bright, colorful music. Sullivan went to Venice to soak up the atmosphere. Once back in England, he received the lyrics to the new opera as Gilbert completed them. Sullivan however puttered at them. He was distracted with plans for the grand opera. He devoted the fall of 1889 however to The Gondoliers. Sullivan labored at the light opera and completed it by December 2. The curtain went up on The Gondoliers on December 7 before a brilliant audience. The press raved.Brahms, pgs.193-194 == Success == The Gondoliers was an instant hit in London, chalking up 554 performances. It earned more money than any other Savoy opera in its original run. 20,000 copies of the published score were sold on publication, and over 70,000 copies of various arrangements were sold within a few days.Dark and Grey, p. 115 D'Oyly Carte's \"E\" Company mounted the first provincial production on 19 February 1890 in Preston, Lancashire.Rollins and Witts, p. 75 From then on, it was never absent from the touring repertory until it was omitted from the final two seasons (September 1980â€“February 1982) before the closing of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. ==Roles== *The Duke of Plaza-Toro, A Grandee of Spain (comic baritone) *Luiz, his Attendant (lyric baritone or tenor) *Don Alhambra del Bolero, the Grand Inquisitor (bass- baritone) *Marco Palmieri, Venetian Gondolier (tenor) *Giuseppe Palmieri, Venetian Gondolier (baritone) *Antonio, Venetian Gondolier (baritone) *Francesco, Venetian Gondolier (tenor) *Giorgio, Venetian Gondolier (bass) *Annibale, Venetian Gondolier (speaking role/chorus) *The Duchess of Plaza- Toro (contralto) *Casilda, her Daughter (soprano) *Gianetta, Contadina (soprano) *Tessa, Contadina (mezzo-soprano) *Fiametta, Contadina (soprano) *Vittoria, Contadina (mezzo-soprano) *Giulia, Contadina (mezzo-soprano or soprano) *Inez, the King's Foster-mother (contralto) *Chorus of Gondoliers and Contadine, Men-at-Arms, Heralds and Pages == Story of the opera == Marco and Giuseppe are two gondoliers.
