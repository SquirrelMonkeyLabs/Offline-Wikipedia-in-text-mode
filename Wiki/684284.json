 "text": "The Popular Socialist Party (, PSP) was a communist party in Cuba. It was originally called the Communist Party of Cuba (). It was formed in 1925 by a group including Blas Roca, Anibal Escalante, Fabio Grobart, Alfonso Bernal del Riesgo and Julio Antonio Mella, who was its leader until his assassination in Mexico in 1929. It was later renamed the \"Communist Revolutionary Union\". After the electoral victory of the Partido Aut√©ntico in the 1944 elections, the party became less popular, and it eventually adopted the name \"Popular Socialist Party\" for electoral reasons. In 1961 the party merged into the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI). == References == Category:Political parties in Cuba Category:Havana Category:20th-century establishments in Cuba Category:1925 establishments in North America Category:1961 disestablishments Category:Communist parties",
