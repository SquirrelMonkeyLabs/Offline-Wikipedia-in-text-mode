Most Mandriva Linux developers who were laid off went to Mageia. In May 2015, Mandriva went into administration. == Brief history == Mandriva was first made public by a French software company MandrakeSoft. Its first release was based on Red Hat Linux 5.1 and was released in July 1998. Mandriva Linux was originated by GaÃ«l Duval, and intended to focus on ease of use for new users. From its first release to version 8.0, Mandrake named its flagship distribution Linux-Mandrake. From version 8.1 to 9.2 it was called Mandrake Linux. In February 2004, MandrakeSoft lost a court case for infringement. It renamed its products. Starting from version 10.0, Mandrake Linux became known as Mandrakelinux, and its logo changed accordingly. Similarly, MandrakeMove became Mandrakemove. In April 2005, Mandrakesoft announced the corporate acquisition of Conectiva,. As a result of this acquisition and the legal dispute with Hearst Corporation, Mandrakesoft announced that the company was changing its name to Mandriva, and that their Linux distribution Mandrake Linux would henceforward be known as Mandriva Linux. ==Versions== Since 2007, Mandriva was released on a 6-month fixed-release cycle, similar to Ubuntu and Fedora. However, while newer features are added during each release, the timing of the Spring release stays the same as the first release, so as to ensure stability each year. ===Latest version=== The latest stable version is Mandriva Linux 2011.0 (2011.0), released on 2011-08-28. ===Development version=== The development tree of Mandriva Linux has always been known as Cooker. This tree is directly released as a new stable version. The current release is named 2009.1 and was released in April 2009. ===Table of versions=== Year Number Name 1998 5.1 Venice 1998 5.2 Leeloo 1999 5.3 Festen 1999 6.0 Venus 1999 6.1 Helios 2000 7.0 Air 2000 7.1 Helium 2000 7.2 Odyssey (called Ulysses during beta) 2001 8.0 Traktopel 2001 8.1 Vitamin 2002 8.2 Bluebird 2002 9.0 Dolphin 2003 9.1 Bamboo 2003 9.2 FiveStar 2004 10.0 Community and Official 2004 10.1 Community 2004 10.1 Official 2005 10.2 Limited Edition 2005 2005 2006.0 Mandriva Linux 2006 2006 2007 Mandriva Linux 2007 2007 2007.1 Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring 2007 2008.0 Mandriva Linux 2008 2008 2008.1 Mandriva Linux 2008 Spring 2008 2009.0 Mandriva Linux 2009 2009 2009.1 Mandriva Linux 2009 Spring 2009 2010.0 Mandriva Linux 2010 2010 2010.1 Mandriva Linux 2010 Spring 2010 2010.2 Mandriva Linux 2010.2 2011.0 2011.0 Hydrogen 2012.0 2012.0 Bernie Lomax ==Related pages== *List of Linux distributions == References == == Other websites == *Mandriva Official website *Mandriva Community Wiki *Mandriva Development Community Wiki (Cooker) Category:Linux distributions Category:X86-64 Linux distributions",
