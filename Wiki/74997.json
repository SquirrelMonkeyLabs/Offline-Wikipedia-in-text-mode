 "text": "Halibut is a kind of flatfish often used for food. There are two different kinds of halibut - Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). The halibut from the Atlantic ocean has been overfished. Their names come from haly (holy) and butt (flat fish), because it is said people like to eat them on Catholic holy-days.Oxford English Dictionary == References == == Other websites == * International Pacific Halibut Commission * Alaska Department of Fish & Game Category:Flatfish Category:Edible fish",
