 "text": "Rockland County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. It is about 20 miles north of downtown New York City. About 300,000 people live there. The county has five towns: Orangetown, Clarkstown, Haverstraw, Stony Point, and Ramapo. The towns are divided into hamlets. The county seat is in New City. The largest village is Spring Valley. Rockland has a minor league baseball team, the New York Boulders. ==History== The county was first settled by Native Americans who lived there for many years. It was later found by explorer Henry Hudson when he sailed up the Hudson River in the 1600s. Soon after, many English colonists moved to the area, and formed the first towns. The county was involved in the American Revolution, and an important battle took place there. After America won its independence, the county remained mainly rural, meaning most of it was farms and forests. This continued until the Tappan-Zee Bridge and Palisades Parkway were opened in the 1950s. These roads connected the county to New York City, allowing people to drive there. This caused more people to move to Rockland. ==References== ==Other websites== *Rockland County official website *The Historical Society of Rockland County Category:New York (state) counties",
