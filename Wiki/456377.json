 "text": "\"Acquiesce\" is a song that appeared on the B-side to Oasis' first UK #1 single, \"Some Might Say\". The song was released on 24 April 1995. The song was included on the B-sides compilation album The Masterplan which was released in 1998, after it was voted for inclusion by fans of the band on their official website. The song was also released as one of the lead tracks to Oasis' Stop the Clocks EP, in promotion of their compilation album, Stop the Clocks. The verses to \"Acquiesce\" are sung by Liam Gallagher and the chorus is sung by Noel (because, he claimed that Liam could not reach the high notes), making it the first song to ever feature both Gallagher brothers on lead vocals. The only other Oasis songs to feature both of them on lead vocals are \"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is\", from their 2000 album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, \"Born on a Different Cloud\", from their 2002 album Heathen Chemistry, and \"Let There Be Love\", from their 2005 album Don't Believe the Truth. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1995 songs Category:Oasis (band) songs",
