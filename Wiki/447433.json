 "text": "Buitreraptor is a small dromaeosaur from the Cretaceous of Argentina. It was about four to five feet long (1.5 metres).Paul G.S. 2010. The Princeton field guide to dinosaurs. Princeton University Press, 139. Buitreraptor has a slender, flat, extremely elongated snout. Its jaws have many small teeth which lack meat-tearing serrations or cutting edges. They are grooved, strongly recurved and flattened. This probably meant it ate quite small animals, like lizards and mammals. Since its close relatives had feathers, it is likely that Buitreraptor also was feathered. == References == Category:Dromaeosauridae Category:Dinosaurs of South America Category:Cretaceous dinosaurs",
