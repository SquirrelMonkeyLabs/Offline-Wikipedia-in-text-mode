He followed that up with a video on Twitter where he called for \"truth and justice\". On June 14, 2023, West announced he would also run for the Green Party's nomination in their primaries. On October 5, West announced he would instead be seeking to run an Independent campaign and thus dropped out of the Green Party primaries, beginning the process for ballot access. West's campaign talks about support for Medicare for All, public housing, action on climate change, and drastically cutting the US military budget. West been polling in the mid-single digits in most general election polls, and is seen as a long-shot candidate. Several Democratic analysts said that he could draw votes away from Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris in a general election. On April 10, 2024, West announced that he had chosen academic Melina Abdullah as his vice presidential running mate. ==References== West, Cornel",
