 "text": "The Bengal whipping frog, Bengal whipping tree frog, or Terai tree frog (Polypedates taeniatus) is a frog found in India, Nepal, and possibly Bhutan. This species has been observed at elevations of up to 500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in grasslands, forests, and places with shrubs. The female frog lays eggs on branches over pools of water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, this frog can die when human beings start fires to kill reeds and from chemicals meant to kill pests. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
