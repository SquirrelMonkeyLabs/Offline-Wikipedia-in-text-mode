 "text": "The Poltava Regional Museum is one of the oldest and most prominent museums in Ukraine, located in the city of Poltava. Founded in 1891, the museum initially focused on natural history and archaeology but gradually expanded to include exhibits on history, culture, and art. The museum is housed in the former building of the Poltava Provincial Zemstvo, an architectural masterpiece designed by Vasyl Krychevsky, completed in 1908. This building is an outstanding example of the Ukrainian Modern style, blending traditional folk elements with contemporary design. == Collections and exhibits == The museum's collection comprises over 300,000 artifacts, including: * Archaeological Finds: Ancient artifacts from the region, such as tools and ceramics, highlighting Poltava's prehistoric and early medieval history. * Ethnographic Items: Traditional clothing, carpets, and embroidery, showcasing the cultural heritage of Poltava's rural communities. * Natural History: Specimens of flora and fauna native to the region. * Historical Documents: Materials related to the Battle of Poltava (1709) and its impact on Ukrainian and European history. == War and recovery == During World War II, the museum suffered significant losses, with many exhibits looted or destroyed. After the war, extensive restoration efforts helped recover and rebuild its collections. Today, the museum continues to play a vital role in preserving and presenting Poltava's rich cultural and historical legacy. == Modern role == The Poltava Regional Museum serves as an educational and cultural hub, hosting exhibitions, workshops, and lectures.
