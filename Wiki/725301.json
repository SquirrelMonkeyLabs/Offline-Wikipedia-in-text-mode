 "text": "Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a type of computer memory that can hold its data even when the computerâ€™s power is turned off. Unlike volatile memory, it does not need its data to be continually refreshed. It is the type of memory used in ROM memory chips such as those holding a PC's bootloader program. Flash memory, often used in secondary storage, is also non-volatile. == References == Category:Computer memory",
