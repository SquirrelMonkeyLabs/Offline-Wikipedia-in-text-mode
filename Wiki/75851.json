 "text": "\"Le Mali\" (English: \"The Mali\") is the national song of Mali. Seydou Badian Kouyate wrote the words and Banzoumana Sissoko wrote the music. It is known as \"Pour l'Afrique et pour toi, Mali\" (English: \"For Africa and for you, Mali\") or \"À ton appel Mali\" (English: \"At your call, Mali\"). It became Mali's national song in 1962 and it is a normal song of love of the country. It is about how the people of Mali would sacrifice their lives for their nation and for freedom. A common theme in the song is wanting to unite Africa. The chorus is written below: ==Lyrics== French original English translation I At your call, Mali For your prosperity Loyal towards your destiny We will be all united, One people, one goal, one faith, For a united Africa If the enemy should show himself Inside or outside, Standing on the ramparts, We are ready to die. For Africa and for you, Mali, Our banner shall be liberty. For Africa and for you, Mali, Our fight shall be for unity. Oh, Mali of today, Oh, Mali of tomorrow, The fields are flowering with hope Hearts are thrilling with confidence. II Standing town and country Standing women, young and old For the country moving Towards a bright future For our dignity Let us strengthen our ranks well For the public salvation Let us forge the common good Together shoulder to shoulder Let us make the path of happiness III The path is hard very hard Which leads to common happiness Courage and dedication Vigilance at all times Truth of ancient times Truth everyday Happiness through labour Will make the Mali of tomorrow IV Africa finally rises Let us welcome this new day Let us welcome liberty Let us march towards unity New found dignity Support our fight True to our oath Of making Africa united My brothers standing together All at the appointment of honour ===In local languages=== Bambara lyricshttps://www.mali-pense.net/L-Hymne-du-Mali.html Arabic translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&v;=7zri3ttWgy0 Alternate Arabic lyricshttps://m.youtube.com/watch?si=NKRJ_ZC7BeEAh5lA&v;=8BIdRMtERmY&feature;=youtu.be Soninké translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?si=N3sgpJDjux7yeODt&v;=V2ZeqHzFEc8&feature;=youtu.be Songhai translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&v;=KLtKOG1JLg0 ==References== == Other websites == * Mali: Le Mali - Audio of the national anthem of Mali, with information and lyrics (archive link) * Presidency of Mali: Symboles de la République, L'Hymne National du Mali: history and lyrics, updated 13 June 2003.
