 "text": "A swirly or swirlie is a form of bullying in which the victim's head is put into a toilet. Some people have questioned whether swirlies are real or whether they were invented for television and other fiction. ==In fiction== On television, one or more bigger people, usually high school boys, pick up the victim. Then they dunk the victim's head in a toilet and flush it. The swirling water gives the swirly its name. For example, in the television show Archer, Archer tells Lana about how he got pneumonia from getting a swirly in high school: Two bigger boys had picked him up, turned him upside down, and put his head in a toilet. In The Simpsons, Bart Simpson gets a swirly from Jimbo Jones. In Cobra Kai, Kenny Payne gets revenge against Anthony LaRusso by dunking his head into a used toilet, giving him a swirly. ==In real life== There are a few reports of swirlies in real life. In some, the victim agreed to be part of the swirly. In other reports, the victim describes the swirly almost exactly like a swirly in fiction. One Blair Academy wrestler talked about being given swirlies and other abuse from older teammates. In others, the person giving the swirly is an adult or even a parent and not an older child. ==References== Category:Bullying",
