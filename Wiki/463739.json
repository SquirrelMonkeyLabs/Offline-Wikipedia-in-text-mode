 "text": "Rackstraw Downes (born 1939) is a British-born American realist painter and author. Downs was born Rodney Harry Rackstraw Downes in Pembury, Kent, England. His oil paintings are known for their details about the months of plein-air sessions. His drawings usually show industry and the environment background.\"He like jam-ups of culture and nature, where practical human uses overlap with indifferent geology and shaggy flora--he is the bard of weeds.\" Peter Schjeldahl, The New Yorker, quoted by Schwartz, Sanford; Storr, Robert, and Downes, Rackstraw. Rackstraw Downes. Princeton University Press, April 2005. Downs lives in Midland, Texas, but was originally from Maine and Connecticut. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:British painters Category:Writers from Kent Category:American painters Category:Writers from Texas Category:Writers from Maine Category:Writers from Connecticut Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States",
