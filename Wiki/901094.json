 "text": "Fireman Sam (Welsh: Sam Tân) is a Welsh/British animated children's television series about a fireman named Sam and his fellow firefighters who work in the Pontypandy Fire Station, and other residents in a fictional Welsh rural village called Pontypandy (a portmanteau of two real towns, Pontypridd and Tonypandy). The first five series of the show were animated in stop motion, but starting with the sixth series onwards, the show is completely animated in CGI. ==Original idea== The original idea for the series came from two former firemen from London, who took their idea to artist and writer Rob Lee who developed the concept, and the show was commissioned. The series first appeared in Welsh on S4C on 1 September 1987, and two months later in English on BBC One on 17 November 1987. == Characters == === Firefighters === * Fireman Sam is the brave archetypal fireman and protector, who remains composed in an emergency and unfailingly offers assistance to all those in need. He is single, but maintains a close relationship with his niece, Sarah and nephew, James. He spends his spare time in his inventing shed, in which he makes devices ranging from a potato picker made from old bicycle parts to a machine capable of replacing the band. On occasion his inventive streak can undermine his emphasis on fire safety. * Elvis Cridlington provides a stark contrast to Sam in both competency and demeanour. * Station Officer Steele is the chief of Pontypandy Fire Station. As a former army officer, he insists upon a high standard of both hygiene and efficiency in the fire station. * Penny Morris is the only firewoman before Ellie Phillips. She only visited occasionally (hailing from Newtown fire station), and in the new series, she works at Pontypandy fire station full-time. Penny doubles as a mechanic. Her ideas are often unconventional and at odds with her male colleagues, but she usually turns out to have been right. Penny is often known to go on adventures with the children Sarah and James, Norman Price and Mandy Flood. A relationship between her and Elvis has been hinted more than once. It is also hinted that Penny is a vegetarian. * Chief Fire Officer Boyce hails from Newtown and visits Pontypandy. * Ellie Phillips is the new female firefighter introduced in the latest feature-length special \"Heroes of the Storm\". She attended the Newtown Fire Academy and was one of the best in the batch. * Arnold McKinley is the new fireman introduced in the latest feature-length special \"Heroes of the Storm\". It is him who gave the name \"Hydrus\" to the new rescue vehicle introduced at the end of this special. He attended the Newtown Fire Academy and was one of the best in his batch. * Jerry Lee Cridlington is a new firefighter and Elvis' cousin. He made his debut in Castles in the Air as a replacement while Penny Morris was away for the day and whilst he was at the fire station he got Station Officer Steele confused as he thought Elvis was in two places at once. He resembles Elvis, though he has blond hair and according to Elvis, he is the better cook of the two. === Pontypandy residents === * Bella Lasagne is the absent-minded village café owner, hailing from Italy and has since moved to Newtown, making various visits. Bella appears to be based on the real Welsh Italians who ran cafés known as \"Bracchis\" in South Wales Valleys. * Ben Hooper is the new coastguard who operates the ocean rescue center. * Bentley Jones was Fireman Sam's superhuman invention. He appears in Bentley the Robot and Fireman Sam in Action. * Bronwyn Jones (née Griffiths) is a Pontypandy citizen who runs the Wholefish Café and is the mother of Sarah and James. She is the wife of Charlie and the sister-in-law of Fireman Sam. * Buck Douglas is an alien-hunter and television presenter who will be introduced in the Fireman Sam special, Alien Alert. * Charlie Jones is a fisherman, Bronwyn's husband, Fireman Sam's brother and father of Sarah and James. He is running his fishing boat. * Derek Price is Norman's cousin, Dilys Price' nephew. * Dilys Price runs the village shop. She is a well known gossip, and has great affection for Trevor, the bus driver (something which poor Trevor is too shy to act upon). Dilys is the mother of mischief-maker Norman Price, but is frequently blind to her son's troublesome ways. She dotes on her only child, or \"Mummy's Little Darling\" or My Little Treasure as she sometimes calls him. In the original series, Dilys is shown to be more snobbish than in the later series. She also appears to use malapropisms in her speech (for example, \"historical\" instead of \"hysterical\", \"I'm suffering from smoke installation (inhalation)\", and \"I'm a very reprehensible (responsible) person, me\"). She tells her son Norman to turn off the \"eccentric\" (electric) blanket given to Norman by his Nan. Dilys is also known to be self-centered; when she and Bella think they are going to be abducted by aliens, Bella says, \"It's-a coming straight for us!\", to which Dilys replies, \"Stands to reason, if they want intelligent lifeforms,\" while looking disapprovingly at Bella. * Gareth Griffiths is the father of Bronwyn, maternal grandfather of Sarah and James and Charlie's father-in-Law. * Hannah Sparkes is an eleven-year-old girl and Joe and Lizzie's daughter. She is the only child in Pontypandy to use a wheelchair. * Helen Flood is the nurse, mother of Mandy Flood, and wife of Mike Flood. * Sarah and James Jones are the relatively well-behaved six-year- old twins of Charlie and Bronwyn, niece and nephew of Fireman Sam. They are often more sensible in an emergency than Norman. When they grow up they want to be firefighters like their uncle Sam. They started acting more like naughty twins in the 2008 series (i.e. insulting each other, having arguments, and sometimes being the cause of an emergency, but it is made clear they still care for each other). Sarah's catchphrase from 2012 is \"I have/What a totally brilliant idea!\" while James' is \"Here I go.\" * Joe Sparkes is the village's mechanic and father of Hannah Sparkes. * Lily Chen is the three-year-old daughter of Mrs Chen and youngest child on the show. * Lizzie Sparkes is Joe's wife, Hannah's mum and the vet. * Mandy Flood is a seven-year-old girl and daughter to Helen and Mike Flood. Her behaviour is that of a bridge between naughty Norman and well-behaved Sarah and James. * Mike Flood is a handyman, husband of Helen, and father of Mandy Flood. * Moose Roberts is a famous mountain climber from Canada and works at the Mountain Activity Centre. * Mrs Chen is the mother of Lily and the rather rude and bossy schoolteacher. * Norman Price is a seven-year-old boy with a love of practical jokes and skateboarding. Unfortunately, Norman regularly fails to set appropriate limits on his own behaviour, and has been known to cause mischief and sometimes causes havoc at the fire station, and for many of Pontypandy residents. He has shown interest in becoming a firefighter himself one day. * Tom Thomas is a helicopter pilot from Australia. He helps with certain emergencies if the firefighters need his assistance. * Trevor Evans is a West Indian former auxiliary fireman with the Pontypandy brigade. His job is as the village's bus driver. He is known for his fondness for cricket, his fear of heights, his awkward manner and general bad luck streak, but nonetheless exhibits a great devotion to the welfare of others (especially Dilys). In the 2005 and 2008 seasons, Trevor is no longer an auxiliary firefighter but is still the bus driver, and the spark between him and Dilys still holds strong. === Animals === * Rosa is Bella's pet cat that often goes missing. * Dusty is a stray flea-ridden dog that soon becomes the fire station's mascot. * Lambykins is a lamb that is Woolly's child. Norman also tries to look after Lambykins. * Lion is Bronwyn's striped, ginger cat. * Nipper is Gareth's brown dog. * Norris is James and Sarah's guinea pig. * Radar is a fire station Dalmatian dog. * Woolly is a sheep that Norman tries to look after. === Others === * WP was the call sign of fire control during the first four seasons of Fireman Sam.
