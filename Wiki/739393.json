The highest mountain in the range is Mount Marcy, at , in Keene, New York. == Origins == The Adirondack Mountains are not part of the Appalachian Mountains. They are a continuation of the Canadian Shield. Their origin is extremely ancient, dating back to the Mesoproterozoic era, in what is called the Grenville orogeny. After that old chain had been eroded away, recent uplifts produced the mountains we see today. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of the United States Category:Geography of New York (state)",
