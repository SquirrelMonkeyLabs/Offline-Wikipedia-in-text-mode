 "text": "Tissue culture or cell culture is a way to grow cells in a laboratory. Cells are taken, and put into in a flask or Petri dish. They can be grown on a growth medium, sometimes an agar plate. The cells divide, and can be treated in various ways. This is done for a number of purposes, especially for the use of scientific research: *Growing bacteria or fungi for experiments or for identification. An example would be growing bacteria to see what antibiotics they are resistant to. *Growing cells of plants or animals for various experimental purposes. **Plant cuttings can be grown: roots grow out of a sprig. **In-Vitro Fertilization is when eggs are taken and fertilized with sperm in the dish. == References == Category:Cell biology Category:Laboratory techniques",
