 "text": "A temperance hall is a building where people could meet, talk, and do things. They had rules so people could come and not be bothered by others who were behaving badly by drinking too much wine and other alcoholic drinks. Many temperance halls were built in the 1800s for the temperance movement and many still can be found today. == References == Category:Alcohol drinking habits Category:Buildings and structures",
