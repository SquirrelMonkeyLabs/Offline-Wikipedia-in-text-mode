 "text": "Cell theory is the historic scientific theory, now accepted by everyone, that living organisms are made up of cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and the basic unit of reproduction. == History == With many improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery was made by Robert Hooke and began cell biology, the scientific study of cells. Cell theory was eventually made in 1838. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. ==References== Category:Cell biology",
