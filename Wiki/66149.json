 "text": "The Animals were an English music group, who were most popular in the 1960s. They were known for their bluesy sound, and their heavy-voiced singer Eric Burdon. One of their first hit songs, \"The House of The Rising Sun\", was an old American folk song, which they performed with a rock and roll beat. Folk musician Bob Dylan was impressed by the Animals version of the song. Other Animals hits included \"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place\", \"Don't Bring Me Down\", \"It's My Life\", \"See See Rider\", \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\", and \"I'm Crying\". The original Animals disbanded, and Burdon moved to the United States in 1967, where he formed a new version of the band. They made more records, like \"San Franciscan Nights\", \"Sky Pilot\", \"When I Was Young\", \"Paint it Black\", \"River Deep Mountain High\", \"Gratefully Dead\" and \"Monterey\". The original Animals reunited in later years, to perform concerts, and Burdon performed Animals songs with other bands. Bass guitarist Chas Chandler became a music producer, with artists like Jimi Hendrix and Slade. Keyboardist Alan Price left the band in early 1965 and went on an successful solo career in Europe. Guitar player Hilton Valentine and drummer John Steel left the music business for many years until they reunited. John Weider, guitar and violin player of the second Animals went on an solo career and was a member of the rock band Family. Guitar player of the second Animals Vic Briggs became Antion Vikram Singh and released a few solo records including Hawaiian music. Lead singer Eric Burdon went on with the funk rock band War, formed the hard rock/heavy metal group The Eric Burdon Band and went on an solo career with many ups and downs. == Studio albums == * The Animals (1964) * The Animals on Tour (1965) * Animal Tracks (1965) * Animalisms (1966) * Animalism (1966) * Eric Is Here (1967) * Winds of Change (1967) * The Twain Shall Meet (1968) * Every One of Us (1968) * Love Is (1968) * Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted (1977) * Ark (1983) == Other websites == * The Animals Official Homepage * An Animals discography from Music City * The Animals at Rollingstone * Category:1963 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1960s British music groups Category:1970s British music groups Category:1980s British music groups Category:English rock bands Category:Music groups from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1983 Category:Musical groups established in 1963 Category:1983 disestablishments in the United Kingdom",
