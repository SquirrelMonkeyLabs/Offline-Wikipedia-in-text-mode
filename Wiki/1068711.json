 "text": "The Godavari, also known as Dakshina Ganga, is the second longest river in India which flows for 1,465 kilometers and covers about 10% of India's total area. It originates in Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Maharashtra, and flows through several states, ultimately emptying into the Bay of Bengal. With a large basin, the Godavari is one of the biggest rivers in India, only surpassed by the Ganges. The river has cultural and religious importance in Hindu scriptures and is known as the Dakshina Ganga. Over the years, dams and barrages have been constructed on the river, impacting its natural flow and increasing the risk of flooding in its delta region. == Religious importance == The Godavari River is important to Hindus, many people have visited its banks for thousands of years as part of a cleansing ritual. Hindu Deities like Baladeva and saints like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu are believed to have bathed in its waters. Additionally, there's a religious fair called Pushkaram held every twelve years along the riverbanks. === Pilgrimage === In the past, people would go on a pilgrimage called Sapta SƒÅgara Yatra along the holy waters of the Godavari River's seven mouths to seek blessings for having children. The pilgrimage included bathing at specific locations like Tulyabhaga river, Coringa village, and others, with the journey concluding near Narsapuram or Antarvedi after bathing in different branches of the river. == References == Category:Rivers of India",
