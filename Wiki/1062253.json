 "text": "Mary Marvel is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Fawcett Comics and currently by DC Comics. The character was created by Otto Binder and Marc Swayze, first appearing in Captain Marvel Adventures #18 (1942). She is the twin sister of Captain Marvel and a member of the Marvel Family, given incredible powers by the Wizard Shazam. == Fictional character biography == Originally, Mary Batson is adopted under the name Mary Bromfield, although she later discovers Billy Batson is her long- lost brother. In The New 52, Mary was known as Lady Shazam. In the Infinite Frontier, Mary later became the new champion of the Wizard and was given the full power of Shazam before later retaking the title of Mary Marvel again. She has been a member of the Justice League, the Super Buddies, and the Black Marvel Family. == Powers and abilities == The powers she has been granted include S for the grace of Selene, H for the strength of Hippolyta, A for the skill of Ariadne, Z for the fleetness of Zephyrus, A for the beauty of Aurora, and M for the wisdom of Minerva. The Prime Earth version swaps out Artemis for stamina instead of Ariadne, Selene for agility instead of Selena, and Aurora for invulnerability rather than beauty. These are the powers of the mythological figures themselves. == In other media == Mary Bromfield and her superhero alter-ego both made their cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe 2019 movie Shazam!, played by Grace Fulton and Michelle Borth, respectively. Fulton returned in the sequel, Shazam! Fury of the Gods, playing both parts. Category:Fawcett Comics Category:DC Comics superheroes",
