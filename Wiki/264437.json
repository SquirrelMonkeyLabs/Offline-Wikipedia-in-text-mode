 "text": "Copper(II) carbonate, also known as cupric carbonate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CuCO3. It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains carbonate ions. ==Properties== Copper(II) carbonate is a blue-green solid. It is made when copper is in air for a long time and turns green. The other part of that coating is copper(II) hydroxide. It dissolves in acids to make carbon dioxide and a copper salt. It breaks down when heated to make carbon dioxide and copper(II) oxide. ==Preparation== It can be made by leaving copper(II) hydroxide in air, which makes copper(II) carbonate. It can also be made by reacting copper sulfate and sodium carbonate. This makes sodium sulfate in solution. ==Uses== Copper(II) carbonate can be used to kill algae. It is also used as a pigment. ==Safety== It can irritate the skin. It is toxic since it dissolves in stomach acid to make copper ions in solution, which can be absorbed. ==Related pages== *Copper(I) chloride *Copper(II) chloride Category:Copper compounds Category:Carbonates",
