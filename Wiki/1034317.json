 "text": "Avraham Stern (December 23, 1907 â€“ February 12, 1942) was a Jewish Zionist terrorist who started the Lehi. ==Early Life== Stern was born in Poland in 1907 but moved to Jerusalem in 1925. In 1929, he joined the Haganah. ==Irgun membership== In 1931, Stern left the Haganah to join the Irgun and started to call himself Yair because of Eliezer Ben Yair, who led the Jews at the Siege of Masada. Stern also got weapons for the Irgun and fought against the British. ==The Lechi== After Adolf Hitler attacked Poland, the Irgun stopped fighting the British Empire since they thought it was more important to fight the Nazis but Stern thought the war would make it easier to fight the British so he left the Irgun and started the Lechi. ==Death== Stern said that the British were so dangerous to the Jews that Zionists should be willing to work with Mussolini to stop them and Stern used kidnapping and assassination to fight the British. The British said they would give money to anyone who could find Stern. Then in 1942, the British found Stern and killed him. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Polish Jews Category:Zionists",
