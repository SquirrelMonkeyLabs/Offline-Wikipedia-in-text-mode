 "text": "The Chicago and North Western Railway's Kinzie Street railroad bridge (also known as the Carroll Avenue bridge) is a bascule bridge across the north branch of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, Illinois. When it opened in 1908, it was the world's longest and heaviest bascule bridge. The Chicago Sun- Times was the last railroad customer to the east of the bridge. They moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in 2000. The bridge has been unused since then. It was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2007. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Bridges in Chicago Category:1908 establishments in the United States Category:1900s establishments in Illinois",
