 "text": "Everton Stadium is a football stadium under construction. It is located in Vauxhall, Liverpool and will serves as the home for the Everton F.C. once it is completed. In 2006, there were talks to build a new stadium in Kirkby. The plan received 59% favourable approval by fans in a ballot held by the team. The proposal would be rejected by the central government. In 2018, the Bramley-Moore Dock was approved for the site of the new stadium. UNESCO was very unhappy with this and stripped Liverpool of its World Heritage Sites because of the decision. They first started to build the stadium on 10 August 2021. The stadium will have a seating capacity of 52,888. It is expected to open in 2025. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Football stadiums in England Category:Buildings and structures in Liverpool",
