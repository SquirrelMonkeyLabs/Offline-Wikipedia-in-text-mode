 "text": "The Ghost of Kyiv () is the nickname given to an unconfirmed MiG-29 Fulcrum flying ace. They are known for shooting down six Russian planes in the Kyiv offensive on 24 February 2022. The Ghost of Kyiv is likely an urban legend and not a real flying ace. As early as May 2022, the Ukrainian Air Force said that Ghost of Kyiv is only a myth; The air force also gave a warning that people should not \"neglect the basic rules of information hygiene\" and to \"check the sources of information, before spreading\" information. ==History of the myth== The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said that the Ghost of Kyiv could be one of dozens of experienced pilots of military reserve who returned to the Armed Forces of Ukraine after Russia invaded. A former Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, later posted a tweet of a photograph of a fighter pilot, claiming it to be the Ghost of Kyiv, who Poroshenko said was real. ==References== Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Category:2020s in Kyiv Category:Aviators Category:Battles involving Russia Category:Fictional European people Category:People from Kyiv Category:Ukrainian military people Category:Urban legends",
