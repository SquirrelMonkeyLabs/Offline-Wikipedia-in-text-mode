 "text": "The bicolored leaf frog (Phrynomedusa marginata) is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 600 and 800 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees in rainforests on the Atlantic side (east side) of the country. It lives where branches of the trees come together like a roof. The female frog lays eggs in cracks in the rock over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water below. Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. After the fungal disease chytridiomycosis came to its home in the 1980s or 1990s, many of the frogs died. The population has not become larger again. The frog is also in danger from human beings cutting down the forests to build farms and towns and make places for animals to eat grass. Scientists say that if they find the frog again, they should catch it and take it somewhere else to lay eggs. Scientists thought there were more of this frog than there really were. They now say those other frogs were another species, Phrynomedusa dryade. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
