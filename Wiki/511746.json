 "text": "Hydra the Revenge (sometimes simply shortened to Hydra) is a steel Floorless Coaster at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the only Floorless Coaster in Pennsylvania and was opened on May 7, 2005. Hydra was built on the site of the former wooden roller coaster Hercules, which was closed and demolished at the end of the park's 2003 season. Its name comes from the Greek Mythology story where Hercules battled the Hydra. ==History== Site preparation began in late 2003, when on September 1, 2003, Hercules, a wooden roller coaster that sat in the current location of Hydra the Revenge, was closed and demolished. On September 14, 2004, the $13 million Hydra the Revenge was announced. Construction began in the spring of 2004 and continued through the winter. Hydra the Revenge was topped off (highest piece of the lift hill) on August 20, 2004 and the entire track layout was completed on December 4, 2004. The first cars for the coaster arrived at Dorney Park on December 10, 2004 and the first ride with people on a train took place on March 24, 2005.
