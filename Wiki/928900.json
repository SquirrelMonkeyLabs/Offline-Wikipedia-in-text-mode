 "text": "British Shooting is the governing body for ISSF shooting sports in the United Kingdom. The organisation looks after Britain's shooting teams for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. ==History== In 2007 British Shooting replaced another organisation called the GB Target Shooting Federation. British Shooting is not a membership organisation, which is unusual for a governing body. Because there are lots of organisations managing different sorts of shooting sports in the UK, British Shooting brings the rifle, pistol and shotgun shooters together from all those other shooting organisations. ==World Class Performance== Since 2007, British Shooting's teams have won several medals at the Olympic Games and Shooting World Championships. At the 2012 London Olympics, Peter Wilson won a Gold medal in the Men's Double Trap. At the 2016 Olympic Games, British Shooting delivered two Bronze medals for Team GB - Edward Ling in the Men's Trap and Steven Scott in the Men's Double Trap. At the 2018 ISSF World Shooting Championships, Seonaid McIntosh became world champion in the Women's 50Metre Prone Rifle. In 2019, Seonaid won three World Cup medals, including the first World Cup Gold medal ever won by a British woman. At the 2019 European Shooting Championships she became the European Champion in the 300 Metre Prone Rifle event. At the 2020 Olympics, Matthew Coward-Holley won Team GB's only shooting medal in the Men's Trap. ==Related pages== * Clay Pigeon Shooting Association * National Rifle Association (of the United Kingdom) * National Smallbore Rifle Association ==References== ==Other websites== * * British International Clay Target Shooting Federation * British Shooting Sports Council Category:Rifle associations Category:Sports governing bodies in the United Kingdom Category:Shooting sports in the United Kingdom Category:2007 establishments in the United Kingdom",
