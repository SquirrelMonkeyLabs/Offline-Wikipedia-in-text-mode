The city is famous since medieval times for granite buildings in 16th century. One of the main incidents in the town's history was an attack by pirates from Algiers in 1583, after which 400 people were taken away. These attacks continued into the 18th century. The town is centered around the Place de la Libération (previously the Place Porta), at the edge of which is the church of Sainte Marie. The town allows good views across the valley.
