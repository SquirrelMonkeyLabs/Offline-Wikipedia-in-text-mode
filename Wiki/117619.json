 "text": "The NHL Entry Draft is an event in which the teams of the National Hockey League (NHL) systematically select the rights to available amateur players who meet the requirements to play professional hockey in the NHL. ==Draft order== Draft order in the Entry Draft is determined by a combination of lottery, regular season standing, and playoff results. In all cases, the team considered is the original holder of the draft pick, not a team which may have acquired the pick via a trade or other means. ==List of Drafts== *2016 NHL Entry Draft - First Niagara Center - Buffalo, New York *2015 NHL Entry Draft - BB&T; Center - Sunrise, Florida *2014 NHL Entry Draft - Wells Fargo Center - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania *2013 NHL Entry Draft - Prudential Center - Newark, New Jersey *2012 NHL Entry Draft - Consol Energy Center - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania *2011 NHL Entry Draft - Xcel Energy Center - St. Paul, Minnesota *2010 NHL Entry Draft - Staples Center - Los Angeles, California *2009 NHL Entry Draft - Bell Centre - Montreal, Quebec *2008 NHL Entry Draft - Scotiabank Place - Ottawa, Ontario *2007 NHL Entry Draft - Nationwide Arena - Columbus, Ohio *2006 NHL Entry Draft - GM Place - Vancouver, British Columbia *2005 NHL Entry Draft - The Westin Ottawa - Ottawa, Ontario *2004 NHL Entry Draft - RBC Center - Raleigh, North Carolina *2003 NHL Entry Draft - Gaylord Entertainment Center - Nashville, Tennessee *2002 NHL Entry Draft - Air Canada Centre - Toronto, Ontario *2001 NHL Entry Draft - National Car Rental Center - Sunrise, Florida *2000 NHL Entry Draft - Pengrowth Saddledome - Calgary, Alberta *1999 NHL Entry Draft - FleetCenter - Boston, Massachusetts *1998 NHL Entry Draft - Marine Midland Arena - Buffalo, New York *1997 NHL Entry Draft - Civic Arena - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania *1996 NHL Entry Draft - Kiel Center - St. Louis, Missouri *1995 NHL Entry Draft - Edmonton Coliseum - Edmonton, Alberta *1994 NHL Entry Draft - Hartford Civic Center - Hartford, Connecticut *1993 NHL Entry Draft - Colisée de Quebec - Quebec City, Quebec *1992 NHL Entry Draft - Montreal Forum - Montreal, Quebec *1991 NHL Entry Draft - Memorial Auditorium - Buffalo, New York *1990 NHL Entry Draft - B.C.

Only after weeks had passed did the league discover that Tsujimoto did not in fact exist. Imlach later revealed that he had played the prank because of his frustration with the excessive tedium and length of that year's draft proceedings. Today, the league officially records the 183rd selection of the 1974 entry draft as an \"invalid claim\". Likewise, the Florida Panthers attempted to draft Russian hockey phenomenon Alexander Ovechkin in 2003, even though his birthday was two days after the cut-off. The Panther's GM claimed that, with the addition of extra days falling on Leap Year, Ovechkin was actually eligible to be drafted. ==Player numbers by league summary== Below is a chart showing where players have been drafted from by year. The leagues represented are the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, United States Colleges, United States High Schools, International players.
