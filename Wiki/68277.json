 "text": "In Hinduism, Jnana Yoga is the yoga or practice of knowledge. Jyâna in Sanskrit means \"knowledge\". In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says that jyâna consists of properly understanding kshetra (the field of activity—that is, the body) and kshetra-jna (the knower of the body—that is, the soul). Krishna emphasizes one must understand the difference between these two. \"Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal.\" Category:Hinduism",
