 "text": "Butane is an organic compound with the chemical formula . It is an alkane with four carbon atoms. It is used as a fuel (sometimes with propane) and in aerosol cans. == Uses of Butane == Butane is sold in canisters, for cooking and camping. It is also used as fuel in cigarette lighters, and as propellant in aerosol sprays or deodorants. Some kinds of Butane are used in refrigerators.

Contact with the skin can lead to frostbite. If the gas is mixed with air and ignighted it is prone to explode like many other fuels that are volatile ==References== == Other websites == * International Chemical Safety Card 0232 * NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards * n-Butane Molecule of the Month * Molview from bluerhinos.co.uk See Butane in 3D * Computational Chemistry Wiki * World LP Gas Association (WLPGA) * LP Gas Association: Propane and Butane in the UK * Global BioSciences In- Situ Bioremediation utilizing Butane * Butane Viscosity as function of temperature and pressure 4 Category:Fuel",
