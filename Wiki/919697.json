 "text": "Cladotheria is a taxonomic group. It includes two of the three living groups of mammals. These are the placental mamnals and the marsupials. The monotremes are not in this group, but all other living mammals are in the group. The Cladotheria also includes some groups which have become extinct.Zofia Kielan- Jaworowska, Richard L.
