She is famous for having run around the world, sailing across the Atlantic in a small boat, and trekking across Chile on horseback. Many of her adventures have been done to raise money for charity and to spread awareness of prostate cancer. == Early life == Rosie Swale-Pope was born in Switzerland by a Swiss mother and an Irish father. Her mother died when Rosie was two years old, and she went on to live with her grandmother in Ireland. Rosie was home-schooled until she was sent to boarding school at age thirteen. She began working for a newspaper at age 18 and very soon she began exploring the world on her own. Rosie married Colin Swale and together they bought a 30-foot catamaran and sailed to Italy. Their youngest child James, was born on board the boat. == Adventures == === Running === Swale-Pope is a solo trekker. == References == == Other websites == * Rosie's around the world website * Clip from Channel 4 documentary 'In search of the Rain Gods' * * Pembroke Dock Civic Reception 2009 (Video) * Category:1946 births Category:British sportspeople Category:British writers Category:Living people Category:Swiss sportspeople",
