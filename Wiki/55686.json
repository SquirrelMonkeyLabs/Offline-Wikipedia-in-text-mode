 "text": "Roseanne is an American television sitcom. It was shown on ABC from 1988 to 1997. It stars comedian Roseanne Barr. The series is about a working-class family living in fictional city of Lanford, Illinois. For many years, Roseanne was more truthful than other series of the time in how it showed family life. They dealt with tough subjects, for example poverty, alcoholism, narcotics, sex, first menstrual periods, masturbation, obesity, feminism, domestic violence, nudity and homosexuality. Another important thing in the series was Roseanne's control in raising her children. Her husband Dan (John Goodman) felt as though he had no say in their house. Roseanne was important for women because it was one of the first series to put an overweight, powerful, yet smart woman as the main character. The series had very high viewing figures from its start. It spent its first six seasons in the top five of the Nielsen ratings. During the seventh season the series dropped some in ratings, but still stayed in the top 10 of the Nielsen ratings. However, during its ninth, and final season, the show's ratings dropped much and had fallen out of the top thirty. Season 10 aired from March 27â€“May 22, 2018. On March 30, an eleventh season was ordered. However, on May 29, 2018, the show was cancelled by ABC after Barr tweeted a message about Valerie Jarrett (an aide to President Barack Obama) that was viewed as racist. Barr wrote: Comedienne and actress Wanda Sykes, a consulting producer of the reboot, resigned before the show's cancellation due to the tweet. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1988 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:1980s American sitcoms Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:2010s American sitcoms Category:Illinois in fiction Category:Television series about dysfunctional families Category:Television series about marriage Category:Television series about siblings Category:English-language television programs",
