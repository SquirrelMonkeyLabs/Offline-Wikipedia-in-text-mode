 "text": "In computer network and computer science, digital bandwidth or just bandwidth means the amount of data that can be sent from one point to another in a certain period of time. It is measured as a bit rate expressed in bits per second (bits/s) or multiples of it (kbit/s Mbit/s etc.) Digital bandwidth should not be confused with: *Network throughput: which is the average rate of successful data transfer through a connection. *Data transfer: which is the quantity of data transferred over a given period of time. == Bandwidth in web hosting == In web hosting, the term \"bandwidth\" is often used to describe the amount of data transferred to or from the website within a defined period of time. Another more specific phrase used for this meaning of bandwidth is monthly data transfer. Web hosting companies often quote a monthly data transfer for a website, for example 500 gigabytes per month. If the total amount of data downloaded from the website in a particular month reaches this limit, the hosting company may shut off further public access to the site. == Internet connections bandwidths == Bandwidth Connection type 56 kbit/s Modem / Dialup 1.544 Mbit/s T1 10 Mbit/s Ethernet 11 Mbit/s Wireless 802.11b 43.232 Mbit/s T3 54 Mbit/s Wireless-G 802.11g 100 Mbit/s Fast Ethernet 155 Mbit/s OC3 300 Mbit/s Wireless-N WiFi 622 Mbit/s OC12 1000 Mbit/s Gigabit Ethernet 2.5 Gbit/s OC48 9.6 Gbit/s OC192 10 Gbit/s 10 Gigabit Ethernet ===Broadband=== Sometimes, the word \"broadband\" is used to mean \"high-speed\", especially with high-speed internet connections. \"Broadband\" means \"wide band\", and suggests high-speed. However, the term is not clear; \"high-speed\" is more clear. A dial-up telephone connection is most often thought to be low-speed, at less than 56,000 bit/s (bits per second). High-speed is usually 200,000 bit/s or faster. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or Cable modem connections are usually high-speed. == References == == Other websites == Bandwidth -Citizendium Category:Computer science",
