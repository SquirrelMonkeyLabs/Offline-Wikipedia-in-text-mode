 "text": "The Japanese flying frog, Schlegel's green tree frog, Schlegel's flying frog, or Schlegel's tree frog (Zhangixalus schlegelii) is a frog. It lives in Japan. It lives on three of Japan's large islands, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and on the smaller Ryukyu Island. The adult male frog is about 32-43 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 43-53 mm long. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. This frog lives in rice fields and marshes in low places or near the low parts of mountains. People have seen this frog between 10 and 1600 meters above sea level. The female frog digs a hole in the ground next to a body of water that does not flow. She makes a nest out of foam and lays her eggs in the nest. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles move into the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. However, it is losing some places to live because human beings build towns and cities and cut down trees to get wood to build with and sometimes because human beings leave farms. Raccoons that people brought to Japan also catch and kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
