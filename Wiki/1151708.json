 "text": "The Kumano Sanzan Hongansho refers to the administrative organization overseeing the preservation and maintenance of the Kumano Sanzanâ€”a trio of significant Shinto shrines in Japan: Kumano Hongu Taisha, Kumano Hayatama Taisha, and Kumano Nachi Taisha. Established in the late 15th century, it managed fundraising and construction efforts to support these sacred sites during their peak as pilgrimage destinations. == Historical background == === Origins === During the medieval period, funding for Kumano Sanzan came from donations, shrine estates, and support from the imperial court. By the 15th century, these financial sources dwindled, prompting the establishment of a centralized system for managing resources. == Roles and activities == The Hongansho organized traveling monks and religious agents, such as the Kumano bikuni (female mendicants), who collected donations through public rituals and storytelling. These funds were used for shrine repairs, pilgrim accommodations, and other religious services. == Significance == The shrines are deeply connected to both Shinto and Buddhist beliefs, embodying the syncretic religious culture of pre-modern Japan. Pilgrimages to Kumano were so popular during the medieval era that they were nicknamed \"Kumano ant pilgrimages\" due to the sheer number of travelers. Legacy and modern impact The Kumano Sanzan and its historical governance reflect the broader evolution of Japanese religious institutions. Today, the shrines are part of the Kii Mountain Range Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The legacy of the Hongansho remains integral to understanding the development of Kumano as a cultural and spiritual center. Category:Kumano faith Category:Kumano Sanzan",
