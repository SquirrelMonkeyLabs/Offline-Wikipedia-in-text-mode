Although Princeton is a \"college town\", there are other important institutions in the area, including the Institute for Advanced Study, Educational Testing Service (ETS), Opinion Research Corporation, Siemens Corporate Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sarnoff Corporation, FMC Corporation, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Amrep, Church and Dwight, Berlitz International, and Dow Jones & Company. Princeton is roughly same distance from both New York City and Philadelphia. Since the nineteenth century, it has been connected by rail to both cities by the Princeton Branch rail line to the nearby Princeton Junction Station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.Princeton Companion, by Alexander Leitch: \"Harper, George MacLean\" Princeton is close to many major highways that serve both cities, and receives some TV and radio broadcasts from each. The Princeton train station was moved from under Blair Hall to its present location on University Place in 1918. Commuting to New York from Princeton became commonplace after World War II. New Jersey Transit provides shuttle service between the Princeton and Princeton Junction stations; the train is locally called the \"Dinky\", and has also been known as the \"PJ&B;\" (for \"Princeton Junction and Back\"). Two train cars, or sometimes just one, are used. New Jersey's capital is the city of Trenton, but the governor's official residence has been in Princeton since 1945, when Morven in the borough became the first Governor's mansion. It was later replaced by the larger Drumthwacket, a colonial mansion in the township. Morven became a museum property of the New Jersey Historical Society. In 1783, it was the capital of the United States for a few months. ==References== ==Other websites== *Princeton Regional Convention and Visitors Bureau *Princeton Township Municipal Web Site (Government) *The Princeton Packet (Local Newspaper) *Princeton Online (Local Online Community) *Princeton Regional Schools *Data for the Princeton Regional Schools, National Center for Education Statistics Category:Boroughs in New Jersey Category:Former capitals of the United States New Jersey",
