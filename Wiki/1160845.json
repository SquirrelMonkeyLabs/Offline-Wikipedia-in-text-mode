He ran for President of Venezuela against current President Nicolás Maduro in the 2024 election. González was awarded the Sakharov Prize in December 2024, alongside Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. ==2024 presidential election controversy== After the presidential election, a political crisis began after the Venezuelan government's announcement of the election results, which said Maduro won the election. However analysts argue that González actually won the election based on the actual votes cast. Most European countries and the United States rejected the official results and see González as the election winner, while a other countries including Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Cuba see Maduro as the winner. Maduro did not respect the results of the election, and instead asked the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which is made up of justices loyal to Maduro, to approve the results that showed him as the winner, which they did. An arrest warrant was later issued for González. He was granted asylum in Spain, leaving Venezuela on 7 September 2024. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Venezuelan politicians Category:Ambassadors Category:Anti-communists",
