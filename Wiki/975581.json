The adult male frog is 25.1-28 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 34 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is green in color, light or dark. The belly is yellow. There is a white stripe on the face underneath the eye. The stripe goes down the side of the body. There is a whitish spot above the place where the legs meet the body. The insides of the legs are light yellow in color. The iris of the eye is red in color. This frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives. They cut down trees to make farms and towns. Droughts can kill this frog. Floods can kill this frog. Other animals, including some animals brought to the area by humans by accident can eat this frog. Climate change can kill this frog because there is more ultraviolet light. Diseases kill this frog. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog. The scientific name of this frog, salvavida, means \"lifesaver.\" The scientists named it after a Honduran beer called Salvavida. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
