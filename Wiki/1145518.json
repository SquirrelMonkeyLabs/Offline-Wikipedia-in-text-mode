 "text": "The Southern Alun-alun of Yogyakarta, locally known as Alun-Alun Kidul or Alkid, is a popular public space in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It is a gathering place for locals and tourists. It is famous for its vibrant atmosphere, traditional activities, and as a hub of cultural experiences. Unlike most cities with a single town square, Yogyakarta has two prominent squares: the Alun-Alun Kidul in the south and the Alun-Alun Lor in the north. Alun-Alun Kidul, which means \"Southern Square\" in Javanese, functions as the \"backyard\" of the Keraton Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta Sultan’s Palace). Alun-Alun Lor, or \"Northern Square,\" is considered the palace’s main forecourt.https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/destinations/java/yogyakarta.html == Historical significance == According to historical sources from Indonesia’s Ministry of Education and Culture, the area now known as Alun-Alun Kidul was once sandy land symbolizing human senses, believed to be imperfect or disordered until organized within a balanced space. In the past, Alun-Alun Kidul was a training ground for royal soldiers and as part of the funeral procession route for dead royalty on their way to the Pajimatan Imogiri burial complex. == Key activities at Alun-Alun Kidul == Alun-Alun Kidul offers unique activities that reflect the local culture and traditions: # Masangin (Walking Between the Banyan Trees) One of the most popular activities at Alun-Alun Kidul is Masangin, which involves walking blindfolded between the two large banyan trees at the center of the square. According to local belief, those who successfully pass between the trees will have their wishes granted. Although this may sound simple, many people fail, adding to the intrigue and enjoyment of the activity. Some see it as entertainment. Others take it as a cultural ritual with deeper meaning. # Sports and Exercise The open space of Alun-Alun Kidul is also used for jogging, aerobics, and light exercise, especially in the morning when the area is less crowded. However, weekends can be busy, as people gather to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and exercise together. # Light- Up Bicycles and Odong-Odong As night falls, Alun-Alun Kidul comes alive with the colorful glow of light-up bicycles and odong-odong (mini vehicles with neon lights). Visitors can rent these tandem or group bicycles and pedal around the square. The decorated vehicles, often in the shape of animals or cars, can accommodate up to four or five people, making it a favorite activity among families and groups. # Culinary Delights Alun-Alun Kidul is also known for its street food scene. Food vendors sell a variety of local snacks and dishes, including angkringan (small roadside food stalls) and traditional treats. Many people come here simply to enjoy a meal, chat with friends, and soak up the lively atmosphere late into the night. == Location, hours, and fees == Location: Alun-Alun Kidul is to the south of the Yogyakarta Sultan's Palace. For visitors arriving from Yogyakarta’s main train station, the route involves traveling down Malioboro Street, passing Alun-Alun Lor, and following the route south through Jalan Ngasem to reach the square. Operating hours: As a public space, Alun-Alun Kidul is open 24 hours a day. Many food stalls and vendors operate late into the night, adding to the square’s dynamic atmosphere. Fees: Entry to Alun-Alun Kidul is free. There are parking fees (approximately IDR 3,000 for motorbikes and IDR 5,000 for cars). Additional charges apply for specific activities, such as IDR 5,000 for a blindfold rental for the Masangin game and around IDR 50,000 for light-up bicycles or odong-odong rentals. ==References== Category:Places Category:Indonesia",
