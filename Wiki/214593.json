These beaches usully come in different varietires: * Beaches that require people to be nude, if the weather permits it. People that are not nude, will not be tolerated. Usually, these beaches are part of a holiday resort, or a club. * Beaches where people have the choice of going nude, or partly clothed. In Europe, this will apply to most beaches which are part of a commune, which designated the beach as a nude beach. Young children running around naked are often tolerated, on most beaches in Europe.This applies to children aged to about 5 years old. In many parts of Europe, nudity on the beach is often tolerated. The beaches where it is forbidden, and the ban is enacted are rare. == Situation in the United States == For example, there is a public nude beach called Haulover Beach near Miami, Florida.
