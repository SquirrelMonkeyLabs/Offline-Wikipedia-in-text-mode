This frog lives in the Anamalai Hills and Cardamom Hills. This frog hides during the day and moves around at night. It lives on the ground in forests or grassy places near streams. People have not seen People have seen this frog between 1200 and 1900 meters above sea level. This frog's tadpoles do not live in the water and instead move across wet rocks and moss using their tails and their back legs. Their back legs grow on them sooner than other tadpoles' back legs. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place. Three of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Anamalai Tiger Reserve, Eravikulam National Park, and Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. Chemicals meant to kill pests can kill this frog when the rain washes them off of farms and into the frog's home. People can also bother this frog by building roads and other things. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog by changing the weather it needs to lay eggs and have healthy tadpoles. Scientists have not seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on this frog, but they think it could make the frog sick. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
