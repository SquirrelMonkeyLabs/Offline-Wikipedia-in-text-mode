 "text": "The Tarot (often Tarot cards) are a set of seventy-eight cards, comprising twenty-two Тrump cards, and four suits of fourteen cards each with four Face cards. In the English speaking world, Tarot cards are mostly used for divination. Tarot cards are also used in many European countries for playing trick taking card games. Cartomancy is to use Tarot cards for divination. Tarot decks did not come before decks having four suits of the same length. They were invented not for occult purposes but purely for gaming. In 1781, Court de Gébelin published an essay associating the cards with ancient wisdom. This idea was later disproved by Dummett. Tarot cards have been used for cartomancy and divination as well as gaming. Nowadays fortune-tellers tend to use specially-developed tarot decks rather than those used for games. Not just the cards but now there are several websites available online where people go to get their answers. They simply put the data on the lucky wheel and it starts spinning. When it stops, the people know what's written in the cards for them. Many websites offer tarot definitions. ==References== ==Other websites== * Tarocchi History at Trionfi.com * Card Games: Tarot Games at Pagat.com Category:Occult Category:Divination Category:Card games",
