 "text": "The 2nd season of The Simpsons first started showing on the Fox network from October 11, 1990 to July 11, 1991. It has 22 episodes. The season started with the episode \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" and ended with \"Blood Feud\". The season was first put on DVD for Region 1 on August 6, 2002, Region 2 on July 8, 2002, and Region 4 on July 24, 2002. The season's executive producers were Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon. They were the executive producers for the first season. The episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" won a Primetime Emmy Award.Emmy Awards official site \"The Simpsons\" \"1991â€“1991\" emmys.org. Retrieved on August 28, 2020 == Production == \"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\" was the first episode made in the season. \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" was broadcast first because Bart Simpson was liked by many people in 1990. The 2nd season had a new opening sequence. It was shorter than the one before (which was about 90 seconds). In the opening sequence before, it showed Bart taking a bus stop sign. The opening sequence in the 2nd season shows Bart skateboarding past characters that were shown in the first season. There were three opening sequences made for this season. One was 75 seconds, one was 45 seconds, and one was 25 seconds. This was done so that editors of The Simpsons could do more with the length of each episode. Many new characters were first shown in this season: Mayor Quimby, Kang and Kodos, Maude Flanders, Bill and Marty, Dr. Hibbert, Roger Meyers, Jr., Sideshow Mel, Lionel Hutz, Dr. Nick Riviera, the Blue Haired Lawyer, Rainier Wolfcastle, Troy McClure, Groundskeeper Willie, Hans Moleman, Professor Frink, and Comic Book Guy. == Ratings == After the first season, Fox moved showings of The Simpsons from Sundays to Thursday so that more people would see it. It was to be shown on 8:00 PM, which started competition with The Cosby Show. Producers of The Simpsons thought that the competition would make their ratings lower. In the summer of 1990, many news companies made stories about the competition. In this time, NBC had 208 television stations. Fox only had 133. \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" (the first episode of the season) got almost the same Neilsen rating as The Cosby Show. The episode got a rating of 18.4 and The Cosby Show got a rating of 18.5. \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\" was watched by 33.6 million people, which was more than the Cosby Show. It was the most watched show on that week. In that time, it was the most watched episode on the Fox network ever. The next episode (\"Simpson and Delilah\") got a Nielsen rating of 16.2, and The Cosby Show got a rating of 18.5 again. \"Simpson and Delilah\" also had more people who watched it when it was first shown. The 3rd episode (\"Treehouse of Horror\") did not get as many people to watch it as The Cosby Show did. After that, The Cosby Show had higher ratings than most of the other episode of The Simpsons 2nd season. \"Three Men and a Comic Book\" was the only episode of this season to get a higher Neilsen rating than The Cosby Show did. That episode was 23rd and The Cosby Show was 26th in the ratings for that week. The Simpsons did not get higher ratings again until in the 3rd season with the episode \"Homer at the Bat\". The Simpsons stopped showing on Thursdays in the 6th season. == Episodes == == References == === Bibliography === * * * Simpsons (season 02) Category:1990s television seasons",
