He served from 1987 until his resignation in 2014. He started a political party called the Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP). This is the ruling party of Burkina Faso. Compaoré became president in 1987 after a military coup and the assassination of Thomas Sankara, who was president then. His attempt to change the constitution to extend his 27-year term caused the 2014 Burkinabé uprising. The uprising began due to attempts at changing the constitution to allow him to run again and extend his rule. He resigned on 31 October 2014 after ruling for 27 years. In August 2021, the prosecutor of the High Court of Justice announced that the trial of members of the government suspected of having played a role in the suppression of the insurgency of 2014 will begin. Blaise Compaoré could again be summoned to answer the judges' questions. ==References== Category:People from Ouagadougou Category:Presidents of Burkina Faso Category:1951 births Category:Living people",
