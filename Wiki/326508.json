Until 2015, it was also home to the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. When Rogers Centre opened in 1989, it was called the SkyDome. It hosted the WWF's WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990 and WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002. WrestleMania X8 attracted the largest ever paid crowd to SkyDome with 68,237 fans. It was the first stadium to have a fully retractable motorized roof. It has a 348-room hotel attached to it with 70 rooms overlooking the field. == Sources == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
