After the general election, she traveled to places like Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota by car. She spoke to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline. While in Standing Rock, she said her trip there was an important reason why she ran for Congress. Before that, she believed that the only way to run for office and win was to have money and power. In North Dakota she saw others \"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community\". This was the reason for her to begin to work for her own community. One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress. They were looking for progressive candidates. Her brother had nominated her soon after the 2016 election. == 2018 campaign == Ocasio-Cortez began her campaign in April 2017.

She said that candidates like her must have very new and different kinds of campaigns and cannot win just by spending more money Ocasio-Cortez's campaign did not take money from big companies or rich people. She did this because it was how Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign did it. Revolutionary posters from the past inspired her campaign posters. Ocasio-Cortez was supported by progressive and civil rights groups such as MoveOn, Black Lives Matter, and Democracy for America, and by actress Cynthia Nixon. Governor Andrew Cuomo, both of New York's U.S. Senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Planned Parenthood supported Crowley.

During her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez held town halls where people who lived in her congressional district would talk about political issues. She focused her campaign on Latino communities of her district and criticized ICE. Her campaign used digital political ads more than actual rallies and events. She would also go to many houses in her district and talk about her campaign in person. === Primary victory and reaction === On June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez won 57.13% of the vote to Joe Crowley's 42.5%. Time called her victory a big surprise during the 2018 elections. CNN made a similar comment. The New York Times said Crowley's shocking loss was \"the [biggest] loss for a Democratic incumbent in more than a decade.\" The Guardian called it \"one of the biggest upsets in recent American political history.\" Crowley raised more money, $1.5 million, compared to Ocasio-Cortez's $83,000. Merriam-Webster said that searches for the word \"socialism\" went up 1,500% after she won. Crowley accepted his loss but did not call Ocasio-Cortez that night to wish her good luck. Many people thought he was going to run against her in the general election with a third party. Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky wished her good luck and were happy about the results. Many people said that her victory over Crowley was like when Dave Brat, a Tea Party movement candidate, beat House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary in 2014. Cantor was also a longtime congressman and important Republican politician. After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez supported many progressive candidates who decided to run against current Democratic politicians across the country.

Joe Crowley stayed on the ballot, as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women’s Equality Party (WEP). Neither Crowley nor the WFP party campaigned in the election. Both supported Ocasio-Cortez after her Democratic primary victory. Ocasio-Cortez said that the WEP was a centrist group that supported male politicians more than female politicians. Nixon ran against Governor Cuomo in the primary for New York Governor. Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman wanted Crowley to campaign on the WFP ballot to beat Ocasio-Cortez. Dan Cantor, executive director of the WFP, asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name was on the general election ballot. Ocasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote to Pappas' 14%. Crowley, on the WFP and WEP ballots, won 6.6% of the votes. Her election was part of a larger wave of Democratic victories in the 2018 midterm elections.

The New Yorker wrote that she had made Sanders's progressive ideas more popular to a larger group of people. Ocasio-Cortez had little media attention until she beat incumbent Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary. Many people believed the media did a bad job on covering the election because no one paid attention to her primary campaign. The Young Turks has defended Ocasio-Cortez from political critics. She was one of the people talked about in the 2018 Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9.

Ocasio-Cortez replied that \"the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color \"go back to your own country,\" is [the] language of white supremacists. We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we [find] the solutions to fix it.\" Trump falsely said that she called \"our country and our people 'garbage'\"; she had actually said that Americans should not be happy with average ideas that are \"10% better from garbage.\" Trump also falsely claimed that she said \"illegal immigrants are more American\" than Americans who tried to keep them out. She actually said that \"women and children on that border that are trying to [find] refuge and opportunity\" in America \"are acting more American\" than those who tried to keep them out.

The plan set a goal of having the United States \"creating 'net-zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years.\" Ocasio-Cortez said that \"We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\" Ocasio-Cortez wanted a marginal tax as high as 70% on income above $10 million to pay for the Green New Deal. Tax experts said in The Washington Post, that this tax would bring in more money of $720 billion every ten years. She used the Modern Monetary Theory as a reason for higher deficits to pay her agenda. She said that the Green New Deal needs a large amount of money like President Franklin D. Roosevelt's original New Deal during the Great Depression. Not one Republican supported the Green New Deal. The plan had support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker. Other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not support it. Pelosi called it \"the green dream, or whatever they call it.\" On March 26, Senate Republicans called for an early vote on the Green New Deal without letting anyone talk before the vote. Senator Ed Markey said Republicans were not being serious about voting for the Green New Deal. In protest, Senate Democrats voted \"present\" or against the bill, resulting in a 57–0 defeat on the Senate floor.

Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being \"rude\". A reporter who heard the conversation said that as Ocasio-Cortez walked away from Yoho into the Capitol, Yoho called her a \"fucking bitch\". When asked about the incident, Ocasio-Cortez said, \"That kind of [event] hasn't ever happened to me ever... I've never had that kind of abrupt, disgusting kind of disrespect [aimed] at me\". Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy did not support Yoho's actions and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that Yoho should apologize publicly. On July 22, Yoho talked about the event on the House floor and, without naming Ocasio-Cortez, said he had not addressed the \"offensive name-calling words\" to any congress members directly.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi wanted the U.S. House to investigate it as a threat. Pelosi said that the video is \"a danger that it represents to everyone in the country\". When Republican House members did not want to criticize Gosar or the video, Ocasio- Cortez said that she believed the video was \"part of a pattern that normalizes violence\". She gave a six-minute floor speech, saying, \"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. This is about what we're willing to accept\".
