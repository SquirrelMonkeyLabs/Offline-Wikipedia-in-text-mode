He represented the second district of New Mexico from 1916 to 1918. ==Early career== Before he was elected, Robinson was a friend and political ally of Conrad N. Hilton Sr., who had served in the New Mexico Legislature from 1912 to 1916. After Conrad's time in office, he showed his support for Robinson's own political career. Robinson served only one term before he retired due to bad health, dying one year later. Robinson was a member of the Knights of Columbus. Other notable achievements include being the first to summit Robinson Peak in New Mexico, accompanied by Conrad Hilton. == Hagerman-Robinson Expedition == Quianu Robinson and six other people, including Conrad Hilton, were chosen to be members of the Hagerman-Robinson Expedition. They were the first to summit what is now known as Robinson Peak, New Mexico. The Hagerman-Robinson Expedition team was created by Herbert James Hagerman, who chose Quianu Robinson, a captain in the New Mexico National Guard as the leader of the team. This expedition was part of a plan to explore and map northern New Mexico, which had been previously unexplored. After the almost 2 month long journey, Robinson and the other members of the expedition team made their way back home. Robinson Peak was named in Quianu's honor. == References == Category:1852 births Category:1919 deaths Category:Politicians from New Mexico Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:Members of the New Mexico Legislature",
