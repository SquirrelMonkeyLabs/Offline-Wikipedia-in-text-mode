 "text": "The President of the United Arab Emirates is the head of state of the United Arab Emirates. Officially, he is elected every five years by the Federal Supreme Council, but because the emir (leader) of Abu Dhabi customarily also holds the presidency of the UAE, the office is de facto hereditary. The President is also Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and Chairman of the Supreme Council and Supreme Petroleum Council. == Emir of Dubai == No Name Term of office 1 Sheikh `Ubayd bin Said ... 1833 2 Sheikh Maktoum I bin Bati bin Suhayl 1833 1852 3 Sheikh Said I bin Bati 1852 1859 4 Sheikh Hushur bin Maktoum 1859 1886 5 Sheikh Rashid I bin Maktoum 1886 1894 6 Sheikh Maktoum II bin Hushur 1894 1906 7 Sheikh Bati bin Suhayl 1906 1912 8 Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktoum 1912 1929 9 Sheikh Mani bin Rashid 1929 1929 10 Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktoum 1929 1958 11 Sheikh Rashid II bin Said Al Maktoum 1958 2 December 1971 ==Presidents of the United Arab Emirates (1971–present)== Portrait Name (Birth–Death) Term of office 1 Sheikh Dhiyab bin Isa Al Nahyan 1761–1793 2 Sheikh Shakhbut bin Dhiyab Al Nahyan 1793–1816 3 Sheikh Muhammad bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan 1816–1818 4 Sheikh Shakhbut bin Dhiyab Al Nahyan 1818 5 Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan 1818 – Apr 1833 6 Sheikh Khalifa bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan Apr 1833 – 1845 7 Sheikh Sultan bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan Apr 1833 – Jul 1845 8 Sheikh Isa bin Khalid al-Falahi Jul 1845 – Sep 1845 9 Sheikh Dhiyab II bin Isa al-Falahi Sep 1845 – Dec 1845 10 Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan Dec 1845 – 1855 11 Sheikh Zayed I bin Khalifa Al Nahyan 1855–1909 12 Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan May 1909 – October 1912 13 Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan October 1912 – 22 August 1922 14 Sheikh Sultan II bin Zayed Al Nahyan 22 August 1922 – 4 August 1926 15 Sheikh Saqr bin Zayed Al Nahyan 4 August 1926 – 1 January 1928 16 Sheikh Shakhbut II bin Sultan Al Nahyan 1 January 1928 – 6 August 1966 15 Sheikh Zayed II bin Sultan Al Nahyan 6 August 1966 – 2 December 1971 16 Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1918–2004) 2 December 1971 —2 November 2004 17 Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum (1943–2006) Acting 2 November 2004 —3 November 2004 18 Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan (1948–2022) 3 November 2004 —13 May 2022 19 Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (born 1949) Acting 13 May 2022 —14 May 2022 20 Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (born 1961) 14 May 2022 —Incumbent ==Insignia== File:Flag of the President of the United Arab Emirates (1973–2008).svg|Standard of the President, 1973 to 2008.
