 "text": "Natural slavery is the idea that saome people are slaves by nature, while others are slaves by convention or by law. Aristotle first wrote about this, in his book politics.Wayne Ambler, \"Aristotle on Nature and Politics: The Case of Slavery,\" Political Theory 15, no. 3 (Aug. 1987): 390-410. In this book, he defines a natural slave as \"anyone who, while being human, is by nature not his own but of someone else\"; he also writes \"he is of someone else when, while being human, he is a piece of property; and a piece of property is a tool for action separate from its owner.\"Aristotle, Politics, 1254b16â€“21. From this, Aristotle defines natural slavery in two phases. The first is the natural slave's existence and characteristics. The second is the natural slave in society and in interaction with their master. According to Aristotle, natural slaves' main features include being pieces of property, tools for actions, and belonging to others. == References == Category:Slavery",
