 "text": "Slime flux, or bacterial wetwood, is a bacterial disease of trees. A wound to the bark causes sap to ooze from the wound. Bacteria may infect this sap. Eventually, a slimy ooze results. This may sink into the tree, and can eventually kill the tree. Also, the fermented sap attracts insects like flies, ants, and maggots.Jacobi, William R. & Ball, John 2016.
