It premiered on August 1, 2011 on GMA Network in the Philippines and on August 3, 2011 on GMA Pinoy TV. ==Post-production== The very first danserye is based on original concept created for GMA Television by Senedy Que with head writer Des Garbes Severino, choreographers Miggy Tanchanco (modern) and Donald Balbuena (ballroom), and directors Mark Reyes (musicals) and Andoy Ranay (drama). In 2010 it was planned for a working title Jump. It is supposed to be replacing Tween Hearts but the GMA Network decided to put it on the Primetime block. The show is slated for 2011 despite 2010. Several auditions across the Philippines were held. And the auditionees were seen in Party Pilipinas (until it was premiered on August 2011), with a working title Time of My Life. == References == Category:2010s reality television series",
