 "text": "The red-headed poison frog, crowned poison frog, or fantastic poison frog (Ranitomeya fantastica) is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== The adult frog is about 20 mm long from nose to rear end. The whole front of the body and head and front legs are bright yellow with white toward the back. The rest of the body is black with gray marks. ==Home== People have only seen this frog in forests that were cut down and have been growing back for a long time and in forests that have never been cut down that have many trees with holes full of water. This frog is awake during the day. People have seen this frog between 180 and 1200 meters above sea level. Some R. fantastica frogs live in trees all the time and some do not. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs under leaves. The male frog moves the eggs. He puts each egg in a different place so that the tadpoles will not eat the eggs or each other. If there are too many tadpoles in one place, they kill and eat each other. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out. People catch it to sell. People cut down forests to make farms, for example for bananas and coffee. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Reserva Nacional Allpahuayo Mishana. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
