The name of the town means \"hill\" or \"mountain\" in the Old Polish language. Beginning in the 14th century, the town became a centre of cloth manufacturing. Góra became part of the Kingdom of Prussia during a war in 1742. In World War II it was occupied by the Red Army in 1945. In the Potsdam Agreement, the town fell to the Republic of Poland, and the remaining German population was thrown out.
