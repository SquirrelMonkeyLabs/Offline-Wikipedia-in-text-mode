 "text": "The Disrobing of Christ is an oil painting by El Greco. It was completed in the spring of 1579 for the High Altar of the sacristy of the Cathedral of Toledo, where it still hangs. It measures 285 x 173cm. Harold Wethey says that the painting is a \"masterpiece of extraordinary originality\". The power of the picture depends upon El Greco's original and forceful use of color. == References == Category:Paintings with Christian themes Category:Spanish paintings Category:Paintings by El Greco Category:16th-century paintings",
