The election process was overseen by the 2024 Bangladesh Election Commission, the official body that's entrusted with the responsibility of making sure that the elections are conducted in a manner that is both free and fair. The Awami League, led by incumbent Sheikh Hasina, won the election for the fourth consecutive time with officials stating that only around 40% of the eligible voters voted. ==Background== Previously, the Awami League had won the 2018 general elections and formed the government. The main opposition party in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), demanded that the current government hand over the power to a caretaker government before the next elections takes place but the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina declined it. ==References== Category:January 2024 events Bangladesh Category:General elections Category:2020s in Bangladesh",
