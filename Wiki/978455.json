 "text": "MetroLyrics is a lyrics-dedicated website. It was founded in 2002. The database has over a million songs. These were created by more than 16,000 artists. ==History== It was the first lyrics-dedicated site to license licensing aggregator Gracenote Inc.'s lyrics catalogue in April 2008. Through this lyrics licensing model, lyrics copyright holders accrue royalty revenue when their work is displayed on MetroLyrics.com. Royalties are paid on all displayed lyrics. They are also handled via Gracenote. In January 2013, LyricFind acquired Gracenote's lyrics licensing business. They merged it in with their own. MetroLyrics' licensing model is distinct. This is because lots of lyric websites still offer content that is unlicensed and copyright infringing. MetroLyrics was acquired by CBS Interactive in October 2011. ==References== Category:2002 establishments in Canada Category:Technology companies of Canada Category:Companies based in Vancouver",
