We've spread our prayer hide all over this place We saw our dearest one to Holy God in grace One day, all of us will come into the Earth's embrace We'll putrefy, my fair one, we'll putrefy. God Himself reads the fate, Himself he scribes He closed the crescent lashes of her beautiful eyes Your peers are walking now with you in Paradise houris they are, my fair one, houris, fair my. Whatever your creed be, I will adore it and pray To be awaken together with you on Judgement Day Rise up once more to kiss your white throat that I may Don't pass for one more trice, my fair, don't pass by. I am Pir Sultan Abdal, the first of the firsts, I feed my soul with the best and remedy the worst I'll pool honey from thousand blooms to one comb till it bursts I am the bee, my fair one, the bee am I. == References == Category:1480 births Category:1550 deaths Category:Turkish poets Category:Ottoman writers",
