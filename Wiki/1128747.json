 "text": "GoldSrc, also known as Gold Source, is a game engine. It was developed by the American company Valve. This engine is famous because it was used to create some very popular video games, like Half-Life and Counter-Strike. == History == GoldSrc was first introduced in 1998 when Valve released the game Half- Life. The engine is actually a modified version of an older game engine called Quake, which was created by the company id Software. Valve made many changes and improvements to the Quake engine to create GoldSrc. These changes allowed them to make games with better graphics, more complex environments, and more advanced physics. == Features == GoldSrc was an important engine because it allowed developers to create 3D worlds that were more realistic than what people had seen before. It could handle things like lighting, textures (the surfaces of objects), and sound effects in a way that made the game world feel more alive. The engine also supported multiplayer gaming, which was important for games like Counter-Strike. This meant that many players could connect to the same game and play together over the internet. == Games made using GoldSrc == Some of the most famous games made with GoldSrc include: * Half-Life (1998): A first-person shooter game where players fight against aliens and soldiers in a secret laboratory. * Counter-Strike (1999): A multiplayer game where players are divided into teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists, and they complete different missions. * Team Fortress Classic (1999): A multiplayer game where players choose different classes like Medic or Engineer and work together as a team. * Day of Defeat (2003): A multiplayer game set during World War II, where players fight as soldiers from different countries. == Impact == GoldSrc was a very influential game engine. It was used not only by Valve but also by other developers to create many different games. The engineâ€™s success helped Valve become one of the most important companies in the video game industry. Because GoldSrc was based on the Quake engine, it was easy for people to create mods (modifications) for games made with GoldSrc. This led to a large community of players who created their own content, like new levels and game modes. Some of these mods, like Counter-Strike, became so popular that they were released as full games. == Legacy == Although GoldSrc is an old engine and has been replaced by more advanced engines like Source and Source 2, it still has a special place in video game history. Many people remember the games made with GoldSrc fondly, and some of these games are still played today. GoldSrc also helped establish many of the standards that are still used in game development today, such as support for multiplayer games and the ability to create mods. Category:Game engines",
