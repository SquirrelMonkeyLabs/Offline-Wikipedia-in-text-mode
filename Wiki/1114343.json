 "text": "Silverstoneia dalyi is a frog. It lives in Colombia, in Chocó, near the Río San Juan. ==Body== The adult male frog is 14.9 - 17.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 15.9 - 19.0 mm long. The skin of the frog's back can be different colors depending on where the frog lives. Frogs from Quebrada Docordó have brown backs and frogs from Playa de Oro have gray- brown skin. The sides of the frog's body are black in color with a stripe in it. The stripe can be orange. There is color on the sides of the body that shows when the frog jumps. Scientists call this flash colors. Another stripe goes over each shoulder. This stripe is bronze-white in color. There is a dark brown stripe on each leg. The legs are orange in color. Human beings can see through its skin to the orange muscle underneath. There is a dark brown spot behind each side of the mouth. The belly is white or gray in color. ==Home== This frog lives in rainforests. It lives near streams. People have seen this frog between 100 and 250 meters above sea level. This frog moves around during the day and sleeps at night. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to streams. People have seen male frogs with six tadpoles on their backs at the same time. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place and because people change that place in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. People cut down the forest where the frog lives to get wood to build with and make farms for plants that are against the law. People also dig good rocks out of the ground nearby. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
