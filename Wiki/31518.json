 "text": "Hula is a type of dancing from Hawaii. Hula is a word in the Hawaiian language. Male dancers and female dancers can both dance hula. A long time ago, hula dance was used only in special ceremonies. Now, hula dance is mainly for entertainment. A hula dancer usually wears a grass skirt or a leaf skirt, a flower necklace (called \"lei\" in Hawaiian), and sometimes a flower in the hair. Traditionally, the hula dancer dances to a chant (a poem that is sung to a rhythm). The chanter beats his or her hand on a gourd (dried, empty squash) to create the rhythm. There are many kinds of hula dance. For example, the Hawaiian hula dance style is slow and the Tahitian hula dance style is fast. Category:Dances Category:Culture of Hawaii",
