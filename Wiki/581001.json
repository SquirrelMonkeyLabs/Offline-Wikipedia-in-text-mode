It lives in forests in the Western Ghats and other hills near the Western Ghats. These birds eat mainly fruits, but also sometimes eat insects. These birds rarely visit the ground, obtaining their water from their fruit diet.They live in hollows of trees. Their call is a kutroo - kutroo. They also live in Bangalore. == Behaviour and description == They are identified by their white cheek, also giving them their name. They are hard to spot, as they are green and look very much like a leaf. They also sit still and upright. They sometimes are found in small groups in fruiting trees, along with other fruit- eating birds (frugivores) like green pigeons, bulbuls and mynas. They live in broadleaved forests, gardens and groves. == References == *Birds of the Indian Subcontinent, Oxford University Press, Helm Field Guides-2010 Category:Piciformes Category:Birds of India Category:IUCN Red List least concern species",
