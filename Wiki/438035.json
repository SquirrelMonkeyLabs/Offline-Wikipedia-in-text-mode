 "text": "A combustor is a part or area of a gas turbine, ramjet, or scramjet engine where combustion takes place. It is also known as a burner, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the combustor or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system.Klaus Hünecke, Jet Engines: Fundamentals of Theory, Design, and Operation (Osceola, WI: Motorbooks International, 1997), pp. 4–6 The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to a nozzle.E T Curran, 'Scramjet Propulsion', Progress in Aastronautics and Aeronautics, Vol. 189 (2000), p. 5 ==Components== * Casing * Diffuser * Liner * Snout * Dome * Fuel injector * Igniter ==References== ==Other websites== *https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/53646 *https://grabcad.com/library/can-combustor-2 *https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319922024752 *https://fetchcfd.com/view-project/75-can-combustor- *https://www.aircraftsystemstech.com/p/combustion-section-combustion- section.html *https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-019-0753-4 *https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5521/6/3/129 *https://armyaviation.tpub.com/AL0993/Figure-1-20-Can-Annular-Combustion- Chamber-134.htm *https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/18/2/390 *https://grabcad.com/library/can-type-combustion-chamber-1 *https://www.aircav.com/gencombu.html *https://nara.getarchive.net/media/30-degree-angle-of-model-7-swirl-can- combustor-c4fc81 *https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/105513/is- there-any-version-of-cfm56-with-can-combustors *https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202311.1853/v1 *https://proceedings2012.caeconference.com/papers/025/UniversitaFerrara.html *https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/tjj-2017-0057/html *https://cfd2012.com/ansys-cfx-gas-turbine-combustor.html Category:Machines",
