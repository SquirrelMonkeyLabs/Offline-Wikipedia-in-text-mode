 "text": "Before May 2022, North Korea had not reported any cases of COVID-19. Foreign analysts believed that the virus had spread to the country. On 12 May 2022, the North Korean government declared a national emergency. It found an unspecified number of people who tested positive for COVID-19. The North Korean government has taken extreme measures, including quarantines and travel restrictions. ==Response== North Korea was one of the first countries to close borders due to COVID-19. The government created widespread travel restrictions, including closing the border to foreign tourists in late January 2020 and then suspending flights and banning travel in and out of the country. Though many parts of the border were closed, the bridge between Dandong and Sinuiju remained open and allowed supplies to be delivered. In late February, the North Korean government said that it would keep the border closed until a cure was found. On 18 March 2020, Kim Jong-un ordered the construction of new hospitals in North Korea. ==References== Category:History of North Korea North Korea",
