 "text": "The Battle of Leipzig, or Battle of the Nations, was a battle of Napoleon I and his army against an allied force of several nations on October 16 to 19, 1813. Napoleon's army had been defeated and depleted in the French invasion of Russia. The French were also losing the Peninsular War and retreating everywhere. Being outnumbered, he attacked. His allies in the Confederation of the Rhine changed sides, and Napoleon was defeated. The batle was the one of the largest battles before World War I and involved about 600,000 soldiers and the largest cavalry charge ever. It was part of the War of the Sixth Coalition. After the battle and the later defence of Paris (1814), Napoleon was taken to the Mediterranean island of Elba. ==References== ==Other websites== * “Easily ranking as one of the largest battles in History” * Allied Order-of-Battle at Leipzig: 16-18 October 1813 * French order of battle: II–XI Army Corps * French order of battle: Cavalry Reserve and the Imperial Guard * http://www.voelkerschlacht1813.de/ * http://www.voelkerschlacht-bei-leipzig.de/ * http://www.leipzig1813.com Category:1813 Category:19th century in Germany Leipzig Leipzig Category:Leipzig",
