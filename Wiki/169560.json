 "text": "A picture frame is usually a rectangular or oval shaped object designed to hold, protect and display a painting, drawing, or photograph. Most picture frames are made of wood or metal, and may have a glass cover. Some can be attached to walls, while others can stand up on a flat surface. The frames can be works of art themselves.
