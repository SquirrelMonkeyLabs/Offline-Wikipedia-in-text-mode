 "text": "Tetrahydrofuran (abbreviated THF, systematic name oxolane) is an organic compound made of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. It has the chemical formula . It is a cyclic compound and an ether. Because the cycle contains an oxygen atom, it is heterocyclic. It is used as a solvent in organic chemistry and to make some polymers. == Preparation == Tetrahydrofuran is mostly made by the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol. A strong acid (usually sulfuric acid) reacts with two equivalents of alcohol, removing a water molecule and connecting the alcohol groups together into an ether. Making a cyclic ether like THF needs both alcohol equivalents to be on one molecule (a diol). == Uses == Tetrahydrofuran is an important solvent, used in many chemical reactions where water could damage the chemicals used. It is similar to diethyl ether but has a higher boiling point. Ring-opening polymerization of THF makes polytetrahydrofuran, a polymeric diol used to make some kinds of synthetic fiber and polyurethane. == Related compounds == It has the same chemical formula as butanone, another solvent. They are structural isomers. == References == Category:Ethers Category:Heterocyclic compounds Category:Solvents",
