 "text": "A mantle is a layer inside a planetary body that is between the core and the crust of a planetary body. Mantles are made of rock or ices. They are generally the largest layer of the planetary body. All terrestrial planets, all ice giants, a number of asteroids, and some moons have mantles. == Earth's mantle == The Earth's mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core. Its mass is 4.01 × 1024 kg. It makes up 67% the mass of the Earth. It has a thickness of 2,900 kilometres (1,800 mi). It makes up about 84% of Earth's volume. The Earth's mantle behaves as a viscous fluid. == Other planetary mantles == Mercury has a silicate mantle that is approximately 490 km thick. Mercury's mantle makes up 28% of its mass. Venus's silicate mantle is approximately 2800 km thick. Venus's mantle makes up around 70% of its mass. Mars's silicate mantle is approximately 1600 km thick. Mar's mantle makes up 74–88% of its mass. Uranus and Neptune's icy mantles are approximately 30,000 km thick. Their mantles make up 80% of both masses. == Moons with mantles == Jupiter's moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede have silicate mantles. Io's mantle is 1100 km thick. Ganymede's mantle is 1315 km thick. Europa's mantle is 1165 km thick. The silicate mantle of the Moon is approximately 1300–1400 km thick. Titan and Triton each have a mantle made of ice or other solid volatile substances. == Asteroids with mantles == Some of the largest asteroids have mantles. For example, Vesta has a silicate mantle similar in composition to diogenite meteorites. ==References== Category:Plate tectonics Category:Structure of the Earth",
