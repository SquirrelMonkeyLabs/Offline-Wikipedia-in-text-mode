 "text": "The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, also known as the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), is a think tank in Washington, D.C. that researches government, politics, economics, and social welfare. AEI is an independent nonprofit organization supported mostly by grants and donations from foundations, corporations, and people. It was created in 1938. AEI's stated goal is \"to defend the principles and improve the institutions of American freedom and democratic capitalism—limited government, private enterprise, individual liberty and responsibility, vigilant and effective defense and foreign policies, political accountability, and open debate\". AEI mostly believes in conservatism and neoconservatism, although it is officially non-partisan (does not officially support any political party). AEI is governed by a Board of Trustees that has 28 members. It is made up of executives and former executives from various corporations. Approximately 185 authors are associated with AEI. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Organizational Profile – National Center for Charitable Statistics (Urban Institute) * * EDIRC listing (provided by RePEc) * Christopher DeMuth, \"Think- Tank Confidential: What I learned during two decades as head of America's most influential policy shop\", The Wall Street Journal, October 11, 2007 Category:Think tanks based in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations of Washington, D.C.",
