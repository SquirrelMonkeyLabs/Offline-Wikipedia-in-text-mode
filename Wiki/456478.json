 "text": "Labrador is the part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada that is on the mainland. The Strait of Belle Isle to the east is between it and the island of Newfoundland in Atlantic Canada. To the south and west is the province of Quebec. Not many people live in Labrador; in fact, less than 6% of the population of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador lives in it, even though Labrador is twice as big as Newfoundland. Until the 1950s, most of the people who lived there were Aboriginals. Then some Europeans immigrated to the area and worked as merchants; these people were once called Settlers. ==Other websites== * * * Audio recording of a traditional ghost story from Labrador, Canada * Project Gutenberg e-text of Dillon Wallace's The Lure of the Labrador Wild * Centre for Newfoundland Studies * Trans-Labrador Highway website – detailed information about traveling in Labrador. * Labrador Boundary dispute * Alexander Forbes Collection: Aerial photo survey of Labrador from 1931, 1932, and 1935 expeditions – University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee Libraries Digital Collections Category:Geography of Newfoundland and Labrador",
