 "text": "MyWikiBiz is a wiki directory that lets people write about themselves. It began as a service creating Wikipedia articles for paying corporations. The site was founded by Gregory Kohs, a market researcher. Gregory Kohs and his sister started the MyWikiBiz venture in Pennsylvania in July 2006, first as a paid editing service, writing content for Wikipedia and other sites. The legitimacy of the idea was supported by the English Wikipediaâ€™s Reward Board, where interested parties would offer cash rewards or gifts to create or improve Wikipedia articles. == References == == Other websites == *MyWikiBiz Category:Wikis",
