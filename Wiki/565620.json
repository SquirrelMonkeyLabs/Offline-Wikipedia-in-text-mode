Moc, myśl, żal, strach, pot, krew, sen zwyciężony, Zdrada, powrozy, łzy, sąd i niemiły Twarzy policzek, i rózgi, co biły, Słup, cierń, krzyż, gwóźdź, żółć i bok otworzony Są to dobroci dary, a nie męki, Nie dary, ale łaski źrzódła żywe, Nie źrzódła, ale boskie cuda ręki, Tej ręki, co nam zbawienie szczęśliwe Z swych ran wylała, za które niech dzięki Oddaje-ć serce, o dobro prawdziwe!Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski, Sonet na całą Mękę Pańską at Staropolska.pl (in Polish).
