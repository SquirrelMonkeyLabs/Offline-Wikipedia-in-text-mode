The song was able to make it to #35 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song is about Aaron wanting to throw a party to impress his friends and the girl he likes. A music video for the song was released. In the video, Aaron suggests his parents visit his aunt Joan. After they leave, he hosts a party at his house. During the party, people he doesn't know show up and show a flyer that says it's an open house party. The house starts to get destroyed and Aaron dances on a stage in the backyard with backup dancers. He hears a car door close and he panicks, trying to kick people out and cleanup. His parents see the party and yell at Aaron and ground him. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2000 songs Category:Pop songs",
