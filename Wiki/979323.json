 "text": "\"Bro Goth Agan Tasow\" (; \"Old Land of Our Fathers\") is the anthem of Cornwall. It uses the same tune as the Welsh anthem, \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\", as well as the Breton anthem, \"Bro Gozh ma Zado√π\". ==Lyrics== Cornish original IPA transcription English translation I Old land of our fathers, your children love you! Dear land of the west, what country is your equal? Across the whole world, we are spread far and wide, But our love is for you. Cornwall! Cornwall, we love Cornwall! As long as the sea may be as a wall around you, We are one and all for Cornwall! II Kingdom of King Arthur, ancient saints and the Grail, No other land is more beloved by us; In you every tor, valley, mountain and house Speaks to us in Cornish. III In the darkness of the mine and on the waves of the sea, When we are wandering through overseas lands In whatever place, and in however many countries, May we turn our hearts to you. ==References== Category:British anthems Category:Cornwall",
