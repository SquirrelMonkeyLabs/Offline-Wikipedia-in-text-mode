It was created in 2006 by the Papua New Guinea National Football Association. Like the A-League Men in Australia, the Canadian Premier League in Canada and the Major League Soccer in the United States, the league does not have relegation. The competition has only ever been won by two clubs: Hekari United won the first eight seasons while Lae City have won the rest. ==Results by club== Team 1st place 2nd place 3rd place 4th place Hekari United 8 3 2 0 Toti City FC (Lae City) 7 0 0 0 Madang FC 0 2 0 2 Eastern Stars 0 2 0 1 Gelle Hills 0 2 0 0 Morobe FC 0 1 5 1 Besta PNG United 0 1 3 1 Rapatona 0 1 1 2 FC Port Moresby 0 1 0 1 Lae FC 0 1 0 1 Vitiaz United 0 1 0 0 University Inter 0 0 1 1 Tukoko University 0 0 1 1 FC Morobe Wawens 0 0 1 0 Welgris Highlanders 0 0 0 1 Oro FC 0 0 0 1 PS United 0 0 0 1 Gulf Komara 0 0 0 2 Lae Natives 0 0 1 0 ==Notes== ==References== Category:2006 establishments in Oceania Category:Football leagues Category:Soccer in Papua New Guinea",
