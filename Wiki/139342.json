 "text": "Geoff Bunn is an Anglo-Swedish author and artist. He was born in Birmingham, England in 1963. He has been in galleries such as the Tate but is better known for placing his work in the ordinary environment rather than 'traditional' art galleries. During the early 2000s, he worked in France, for a time, with painter Fred Yates. Bunn has also painted a number of large and rather disturbing canvases of empty interiors. This series of paintings - which Bunn entitles 'Interior Landscapes' - led to Bunn being awarded the Cartazini Prize in 2007. Bunn has written a number of books, including the best-selling transgender romance Blonde Boy, Red Lipstick. == References == *Documenta Exhibition 2002 Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:English artists Category:People from Birmingham",
