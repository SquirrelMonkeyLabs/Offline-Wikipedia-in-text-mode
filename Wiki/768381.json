 "text": "Ederson Santana de Moraes (born 17 August 1993), commonly known as Ederson, is a Brazilian footballer who currently plays for the Brazil national football team and Premier league club Manchester City as a goalkeeper. Ederson was born in Osasco, São Paulo and started his footballing career at the local club São Paulo at the age of seven. After a season, he was signed by S.L. Benfica Juniors and remained there for 2 seasons. He eventually moved on to the Portuguese team Ribeirão in 2011 and Rio Ave in 2012. After delivering several good performances with Rio Ave, he attracted the interest of the Portuguese superpower Benfica who then signed him in 2015 with a release clause (the fee that any team would be required to pay before the player's contract expires) of €45 million. His time at Benfica proved to be successful as he won 4 titles in 2 seasons with them. Meanwhile Pep Guardiola, upon his selection as a manager at Manchester City, made many transfers including the buy of Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. Due to dissatisfaction with the performances of Bravo and promising career of Ederson at Benfica, Guardiola decided to replace Bravo after just one season by buying Ederson for a €40 million fee. The transfer made Ederson the second-most expensive goalkeeper of all time (currently 4th), behind only Gianluigi Buffon. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National Cup League Cup Europe Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Ribeirão 2011–12 Segunda Divisão 29 0 1 0 0 0 — — 30 0 Rio Ave 2012–13 Primeira Liga 2 0 2 0 3 0 — — 7 0 2013–14 Primeira Liga 18 0 7 0 3 0 — — 28 0 2014–15 Primeira Liga 17 0 5 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 28 0 Total 37 0 14 0 10 0 2 0 0 0 63 0 Benfica B 2015–16 LigaPro 4 0 — — — — 4 0 Benfica 2015–16 Primeira Liga 10 0 0 0 5 0 3 0 0 0 18 0 2016–17 Primeira Liga 27 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 0 0 38 0 Total 37 0 3 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 56 0 Manchester City 2017–18 Premier League 36 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 — 45 0 2018–19 Premier League 38 0 6 0 1 0 10 0 0 0 55 0 2019–20 Premier League 35 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 44 0 2020–21 Premier League 36 0 0 0 0 0 12 0 — 48 0 2021–22 Premier League 37 0 1 0 0 0 11 0 0 0 49 0 2022–23 Premier League 35 0 1 0 0 0 11 0 1 0 48 0 2023–24 Premier League 11 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 16 0 Total 228 0 10 0 1 0 65 0 2 0 306 0 Career total 335 0 28 0 19 0 75 0 2 0 459 0 ===International=== Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals Brazil 2017 1 0 2018 2 0 2019 6 0 2020 2 0 2021 6 0 2022 2 0 2023 6 0 Total 25 0 ==Honours== Rio Ave *Taça de Portugal runner-up: 2013–14 *Taça da Liga runner-up: 2013–14 Benfica *Primeira Liga: 2015–16, 2016–17 *Taça de Portugal: 2016–17 *Taça da Liga: 2015–16 Manchester City *Premier League: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 *FA Cup: 2018–19, 2022–23 *EFL Cup: 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20, 2020–21 *FA Community Shield: 2018, 2019 *UEFA Champions League: 2022–23; runner-up: 2020–21 *UEFA Super Cup: 2023 Brazil *Copa América: 2019 Individual *O Jogo Team of the Year: 2016 *SJPF Primeira Liga Team of the Year: 2016 *LPFP Primeira Liga Goalkeeper of the Year: 2016–17 *UEFA Champions League Breakthrough XI: 2017 *PFA Premier League Team of the Year: 2018–19, 2020–21 *Premier League Golden Glove: 2019–20, 2020–21, 2021–22 *UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season: 2020–21 == References == == Other websites == * * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian association football goalkeepers Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:2018 FIFA World Cup players Category:2022 FIFA World Cup players Category:Footballers from Osasco",
