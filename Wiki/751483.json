 "text": "Multiculturalism in Canada is a very important part of the culture of Canada. In the 1970s and the 1980s, the Canadian government officially began pushing for multiculturalism in policy. That has sometimes caused the government to be called the \"instigator\" (startes) of multiculturalism being an ideology. It often tries to bring attention to the importance of immigration to Canada. Canadians use the word \"multiculturalism\" in many different ways. Sometimes, they use it to describe the many different religious traditions and cultural influences and say that this creates a very special cultural mosaic of Canada. The country is full of people that come from many different racial, religious, and cultural origins. Since Canada was created, there has been a lot of immigration. By the beginning of the 21st century, most people were not of a British or a French background. Canada has many examples of multiculturalism. for example, Canada lets in refugees and other immigrants without caring about their race, religion, or culture. Canada's own immigration leader is an immigrant. ==References== Category:Canadian culture",
