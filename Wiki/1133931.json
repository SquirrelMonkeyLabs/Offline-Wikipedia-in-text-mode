Scientists saw this frog for the first time in a cloud forest in Peru. This place is 2,391 meters above sea level. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. If it is in danger, it is because people change the places where the frog lives to make farms for coffee and tea. Scientists do not know if human beings catch this frog to sell as a pet, but they know that people do catch other frogs in Hyloxalus to sell as pets because they are so beautiful. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
