 "text": "In Norse mythology, Váli is a son of the god Odin and giantess Rindr. Váli's brothers are Thor, Baldr and Víðarr. When Baldr was killed, Váli killed the person who killed him. He grew to full adulthood in one day. We don't know whether Norse people worshipped Váli as a god or whether he was only a character in the Poetic Edda. He is also the god of flight. Anything that passes through the sky, whether man made or of nature is under his control. To symbolize this his cloak is made of raven feathers that when he spreads his arms looks like wings. Váli is fated to survive Ragnarök. ==References== Category:Norse mythology Category:Norse gods and goddesses",
