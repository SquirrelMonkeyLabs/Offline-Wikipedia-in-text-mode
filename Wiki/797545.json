 "text": "The ongoing 2020 Thai protests are a series of protests against the government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, which have included demands for reform of the Thai monarchy. The protests were initially caused by the ending of the Future Forward Party in late February 2020. The party was critical of Prayut. This first wave of protests was held on academic campuses and stopped by the COVID-19 pandemic. The protests started again on 18 July in a large demonstration organized under the Free Youth umbrella at the Democracy Monument. Following mass protests on 14 October, a \"severe\" state of emergency, which gave more emergency powers to the authorities compared to those given by the Emergency Decree since March, was declared in Bangkok on the 15, citing the alleged blocking of a royal motorcade. Protests continued despite the ban, prompting a crackdown by police on 16 October. ==References== Category:February 2020 events Category:July 2020 events Category:August 2020 events Category:September 2020 events Category:October 2020 events Category:2020 in Thailand Thai Category:November 2020 events Category:December 2020 events",
