 "text": "The Global Association of Mixed Martial Arts (GAMMA) is an international governing body for the sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). Founded in 2017 by Paolo Biotti and Carlo Di Blasi, GAMMA aims to promote the ethical and moral values of traditional martial arts in modern MMA through regulatory bodies, safety standards, and youth education programs worldwide. Today, GAMMA has over 140 national federations, with around 70 recognized by their respective National Olympic Committees (NOCs) or National Sports Authorities. == History == GAMMA was founded in 2017 after combat sports champion Paolo Biotti, with over 30 years of experience, and European promoter Carlo Di Blasi came together to address the lack of traditional martial arts values in modern MMA. Concerned about the image of the sport in media, they envisioned a federation that would preserve martial arts traditions while introducing innovative safety regulations and structured competition formats. Biotti and Di Blasi have decades of experience in combat sports federations, sanctioning bodies, marketing, and organizing major sporting events with over 14,000 spectators. They established GAMMA as a platform to professionalize MMA, offering a structured ruleset for different competition styles, including submission, light, and full-contact MMA. The organization was founded in Rome, Italy, with the goal of developing MMA globally and securing Olympic recognition. Biotti and Di Blasi are key representatives in GAIF (Global Association of International Federations), working towards formal recognition of MMA as an Olympic sport. == Organization == The GAMMA headquarters is in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Its operational office is in Milan, Italy. === Executive board === * First Vice President: Carlo Di Blasi - * President of the World Member Nations Committee: Eric La Rocca - * Secretary General:Zeljiko Banic - == Tournaments == GAMMA organizes and sanctions major international amateur MMA competitions: * Men’s Amateur MMA World Championship * Women’s Amateur MMA World Championship * MMA World Cup * Professional MMA World Championships * Youth MMA World Championship Additionally, GAMMA is responsible for the homologation of boxing equipment (gloves, helmets, and rings) used in amateur competitions.
