 "text": "The situation for human rights in Syria is considered very poor among international observers.World Report 2010 Human Rights Watch World Report 2010 , pg. 555. A state of emergency was in effect from 1963 until April 2011. This gave security forces sweeping powers of arrest and detentions. == LGBT rights == Article 520 of the penal code of 1949, prohibits having homosexual relations, i.e. \"carnal relations against the order of nature\", and provides for up to three-years imprisonment. In 2010 the Syrian police began a crackdown that led to the arrest of over 25 men. The men were charged with many crimes ranging from homosexual acts and illegal drug use, to encouraging homosexual behavior and organizing obscene parties. ==Women's rights== In the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), there are Mala Jins (Women's houses) in more than 60 localities where women can seek refuge and demand justice. There the women get support in matters like divorce, rape, beatings and other forms of domestic violence. The women of the Mala Jin, have the authority to speak out banishments. In more serious cases they encourage to file a criminal case. Underage marriage is banned within the territory of the AANES. In 2019 it passed a set of laws further strengthening women's rights. == References == * Syria Category:Politics of Syria",
