 "text": "The Philadelphia Soul is an American football team in the Arena Football League. The team plays Trenton, New Jersey. They are not to be confused with the Philadelphia Eagles. They were owned by Jon Bon Jovi and Ron Jaworski, a former player for the Philadelphia Eagles. They won the Arena Bowl in 2008. By 2019, however, all the teams ceased team operations and later the league folded due to bankruptcy. In 2024, the team returned, but playing in Trenton rather than Philadelphia. ==References== Category:Arena Football League Soul",
