Meshech in the Bible can also mean the tribe that came from his children, or the country where they lived, for example in Psalm 120:5. Many Bible Atlases such as IVP and Zondervan state it was in Asia Minor, while others say the Caucasus. ==Related pages== For Gog, 'the chief ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal' (Book of Ezekiel 39:1) see Armageddon ==References== *Prophezine.com *Topical Bible.org Category:Old Testament people",
