 "text": "Mahmoud Khalil, a student activist involved in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, was taken from his New York apartment by ICE agents on March 8, 2025. They said his student visa was revoked by the State Department. When they learned he was a permanent resident, they said that status would be revoked too. He was sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Khalil’s detention has sparked criticism from lawyers, Democrats, and civil rights groups, who say it threatens free speech. Khalil hasn't been charged with any crime. The government is using a Cold War-era law that allows deportation if the Secretary of State believes someone’s presence harms U.S. foreign policy. Critics have compared this to McCarthyism. On April 11, an immigration judge ruled Khalil could be deported, based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s claim that Khalil’s presence is harmful to U.S. foreign policy. The judge said she couldn't challenge that claim. A federal court has paused the deportation while it reviews whether Khalil’s arrest and detention were legal. == References == Category:United States",
