In the early days, scholars who completed their Bachelor of Arts degree were automatically granted the title of \"Master\" as a mark of scholarly achievement and competence. Over time, this tradition evolved, and the title became a symbol of academic distinction. In Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, the Master of Arts is not typically earned through further coursework or examinations, as is common in other universities. Instead, it is often considered as a status or a recognition of the individual's standing within the academic community.https://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-tuf2.htm == Procedure == Upon completing a Bachelor of Arts, graduates from Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin are eligible to apply for the conferment of the MA degree. The process is generally straightforward, and there are no additional academic requirements. The conferral (Granting) is based on the assumption that the graduate has continued to engage in scholarly activities or has contributed significantly to their field of study since completing their bachelor's degree. == Significance == While the Master of Arts from Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin may not represent postgraduate studies in the traditional sense, it carries historical and cultural importance. It signifies a level of intellectual accomplishment and is often seen as an acknowledgment of one's commitment to the pursuit of knowledge. == Usage == Interestingly, the use of the MA title is not universal across these institutions. For instance, at Cambridge, the MA is conferred automatically, and graduates are entitled to use the title without any formalities.

In conclusion, the Master of Arts from Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin represents a distinctive aspect of academic tradition, reflecting centuries-old practices.
