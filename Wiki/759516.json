In 2003 Theatro Technis premiered Justin Butcher`s “The Madness of George Dubya” , reviewed by The Guardian`s Michael Billington “Satire is all but dead on the London stage, so this show by Justin Butcher deserves the warmest of welcomes. Even if it is largely a topical update of Kubrick's Dr Strangelove, it had a packed house at this north London fringe theatre cheering it to the echo.”. The successful run of “The Madness of George Dubya” at Theatro Technis led to its transfer to the Pleasance Theatre in Islington and also garnered support from celebrities such as Justin Hoffman In his yearly review of British Theatre Billington remarked “The most cheering aspect of the year was the varied and rapid response to the Iraq crisis. At Theatro Technis, Justin Butcher wrote and directed The Madness of George Dubya - ignored by most critics until it transferred to the West End –“ ==Theatro Technis actors== Andreas Markou, Stelios Kyriacou, Andy Lysandrou, Spyros Kyprianou, Maroula Eugeniou,Theatro Technis Unfinished Histories http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/history/companies/theatro- technis/ Peter Polycarpou, Eve Polycarpou ,C Kenward, The Hecuba Gap.
