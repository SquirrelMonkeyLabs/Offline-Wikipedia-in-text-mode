 "text": "Resistentialism is a joke theory about objects intentionally being mean to humans. Objects like lost keys, broken printers, or bouncing balls are said to dislike us. It is said to be a battle between humans and objects causing small troubles. The idea was named \"Resistentialism\" in 1948 by writer Paul Jennings. It is a playful imitation of existentialism, with a slogan saying \"Things are against us.\" == Similar concepts == The hostile nature of the universe has always been a topic of discussion throughout history. It has been observed in laws like Murphy's law, Finagle's law, and Sod's law. == References == Category:Humor",
