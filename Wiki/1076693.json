 "text": "The Transitional Sovereignty Council (, 20 August 2019 – 25 October 2021) also called The Fourth Sudanese Sovereignty Council was a military junta that served as the Head of State of Sudan from it's creation in 2019 until it's dissolution in 2021. The council was first created on 20 August 2019 by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan after he dissolved the Transitional Military Council and where immediately Burhan became the chairman, However, Burhan's role over the new council was weak. Thus, the new council immediately became the head of state of Sudan alongside Burhan. The council promised to bring peace, stability and prosperity to the country and make Sudan a very safe and secure country. In August 2020, the council along with Burhan signed the Juba Peace Agreement along with the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit. The agreement ended the South Sudanese Civil War and as well as the long and deadly Darfur conflict. In October 2021, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan led a coup d'état against Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok because Hamdok refused to swear allegiance to Burhan. Immediately after the coup, Burhan announced that he would dissolve the TSC, seize power and declare himself President. The council was eventually dissolved and Burhan immediately seized power and immediately became President. ==Members== The members of the Transitional Sovereignty Council following the coup were: * Abdel Fattah al-Burhan (Chairman) * Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo (Deputy Chairman) * Malik Agar * Shams al-Din Khabbashi * Yasser al-Atta * Ibrahim Jabir Karim * El Hadi Idris Yahya * El Tahrir Abubakr Hajar * Raja Nicola * Abdulgasim Bortom * Yousef Jad Karim * Abdelbagi al-Zubeir * Salma Abdeljabbar ==Notes== ==Related pages== * Military of Sudan * 2019 Sudanese coup d'état * 2021 Sudanese coup d'état * Abdel Fattah al- Burhan * Abdalla Hamdok Category:21st century in Sudan",
