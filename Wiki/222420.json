 "text": "Blood diamonds, also known as conflict diamonds, are diamonds mined in a war zone and sold illegally to pay for anti-government fighting. There have been 3.7 million deaths over diamonds. Blood diamonds come from areas controlled by armed groups which are fighting against the government. These armed groups force civilians (mostly children) to mine diamonds. People who refuse to do this work may be raped, abused, exploited, or even murdered. The armed groups then sell the diamonds and use the money to buy weapons. Then they use these weapons to fight against the government. Diamonds mined during the 20thâ€“21st century civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau have been called blood diamonds.Conflict Diamonds.
