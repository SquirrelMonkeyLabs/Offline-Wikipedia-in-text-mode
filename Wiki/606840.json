Almost all students in Bedford, Euless, and Hurst go to HEB ISD schools. Some students in North Richland Hills, Colleyville, Fort Worth, and Arlington go to HEB ISD.

HEB ISD schools offer special classes about foreign language, art, science, and work skills. In 2018, HEB ISD was rated \"A\" by the Texas Education Agency. == History == There were other schools in this area before HEB ISD, including Bedford College, Bedford School, and Euless School. Mosier Valley School was in the Euless School District. It opened in 1883 and closed in 1949 because it was in bad condition. In 1950, a judge said the Euless School District had to have a separate school for African-American students. The school district opened the old building again for one year. In 1951, Mosier Valley School moved into a new, brick building. The Euless and Hurst school districts combined in 1955. The Hurst-Euless School District had 1,418 students and grew to almost 2,300 students in the next two years. In 1958, people who lived in the Bedford School District voted to combine with the Hurst-Euless School District. HEB ISD had 3,116 students and seven schools during its first year. ==Students== In 2016, the school district had 22,780 students. On tests that year, 85% of HEB ISD students earned good scores. (Only 77% of students near HEB ISD and 75% of students in the state of Texas earned good scores.) Schools in HEB ISD have students of more different races than almost all other schools in the United States. == Other websites == * HEB ISD official website ==References == Category:Organizations based in Texas Category:School districts in the United States",
