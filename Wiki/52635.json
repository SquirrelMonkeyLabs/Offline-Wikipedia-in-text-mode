A flyweight is a boxer weighing above 49 kg (108 lb) and up to 52 kg (112 lb).http://www.aiba.org/documents/site1/Articles%20&%20Rules/technical_and_competition_rules_20111025.pdf Technical & Competition Rules, Appendix K AIBA Boxing organizations created many divisions so that fighters could fight people of the same size. Most divisions only separate each other by few lbs. ==Professional boxing== The flyweight division was the last of boxing's eight traditional weight classes. Before 1909, anyone below featherweight was considered a bantamweight. In 1911, the organization that eventually became the British Boxing Board of Control held a match that crowned Sid Smith as the first flyweight champion of the world. Jimmy Wilde, who reigned from 1914 to 1923, was the first boxer recognized both in Britain and the United States as a flyweight champion. Other notable flyweights include Pancho Villa, Walter McGowan, Pascual PÃ©rez, Pone Kingpetch, Fighting Harada, Masao Ohba, Chartchai Chionoi, Efren Torres, Erbito Salavarria, Miguel Canto, Dave McAuley, Charlie Magri, Gabriel Bernal, Santos Laciar, Sot Chitalada, Yong-Kang Kim, Yuri Arbachakov, Danny Romero, Mark \"Too Sharp\" Johnson, Manny Pacquiao, Jorge Arce, Vic Darchinyan, Nonito Donaire and Pongsaklek Wonjongkam. ==References== Category:Boxing",
