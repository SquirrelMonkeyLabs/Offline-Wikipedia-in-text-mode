 "text": "Men in Black is a 1997 American supernatural action comedy movie. It is set in New York City and stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. In the film, a New York police officer, James Edwards, is persuaded to join a very secret organisation known as Men In Black. The name comes from the black clothes they wear. He is given the new name Agent J and works with Agent K. The organisation is intended to monitor the many alien beings that live on Earth - mainly in New York - disguised as normal humans. One day, a flying saucer crashes into Earth. The 'Bug' that it contains is a powerful alien that takes the body of a human. It is searching for an energy source called \"The Galaxy\". Agents J and K must stop the bug before it can escape. This they manage to do. At the end of the film, Agent K decides that he doesn't want to do this work anymore, and is treated by Agent J so that he won't remember the work he used to do. The movie made over $500 million worldwide in total. It was followed by sequels Men in Black II and Men in Black 3. == Cast == * Tommy Lee Jones as Kevin Brown / Agent \"K\" * Will Smith as James Edwards / Agent \"J\" * Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver / Agent \"L\" * Vincent D'Onofrio as Edgar the Bug * Rip Torn as Chief Zed * Tony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs * Tim Blaney as Frank the Pug * Mark Setrakian as a Rosenberg alien *Brad Abrell as a worm guy *Thom Fountain as a worm guy *Carl J.
