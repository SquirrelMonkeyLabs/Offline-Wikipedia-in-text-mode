 "text": ":For another species commonly known as the Puebla treefrog, see Exerodonta xera The Puebla tree frog (Sarcohyla charadricola) is a frog that lives in Mexico, in Hidalgo. Scientists have seen it between 2000 and 2300 meters above sea level. This frog is in a large danger of dying out because people cut down so much of Mexico's forest. Scientists believe the frog might be dead now. Scientists have not seen it since 1961. If any frogs are still alive, there are probably fewer than 50 adults. They think the frog could die from the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, but they have never seen even one frog sick with it. These frogs live on bromeliad plants in pine and pine-oak forests, but they climb down to streams to lay eggs. Their tadpoles swim in the streams. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
