 "text": "The winghead shark (Eusphyra blochii) is a species of Hammerhead shark. This shark gets its name from the wide lobes on its head. It is the only member in the genus Eusphyra. It is a small and harmless species, and is fished throughout its range. == Description== Like all other Hammerhead sharks, the winghead shark has a \"hammer\" on its head known as the \"cephalofoil\". The winghead shark's cephalofoil is very long and thin, making it different from other Hammerhead sharks. The width of its cephalofoil is 40 to 50% of the body length. The cephalofoil is arrow-shaped from above, and has small bumps in front of the nostrils. Unlike other Hammerhead sharks the nostrils are closer to the centre of the cephalofoil than the ends. The winghead shark is normally grey, greyish-brown or light brown in colour. It is a small shark, usually growing up to the length of 130 cm (51 inches), but the longest ever found was 186 cm (73 in) long. == Where they live== The winghead shark is found in shallow waters on the continental shelves of the Western Indo-Pacific, from the Persian Gulf to the Philippines, north to China and Taiwan, and south to Queensland and the Northern Territory of Australia. The winghead shark sometimes enters the brackish water of estuaries. == Feeding== The winghead shark feeds on bony fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods like squid, octopus and cuttlefish. == Reproduction== Like most other Hammerhead sharks, the winghead shark is viviparous.
