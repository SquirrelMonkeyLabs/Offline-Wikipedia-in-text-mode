 "text": "The Great Chilean Earthquake or Valdivian Earthquake was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded. The quake occurred in the early evening (19:11 UTC) of May 22, 1960, and had a 9.5 rating on the Moment magnitude scale. The earthquake affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. Its epicenter was Valdivia, Chile. The earthquake caused tsunamis that pounded the Chilean coastline with waves of up to 25 meters. The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and caused great damage to Hilo, Hawaii. Waves as high as 10.7 meters (about 35 feet) were recorded 10,000 kilometers from where the earthquake started. These waves travelled as far as Japan and the Philippines. The total number of deaths from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Chile has been estimated at 490 to 5700. The Chilean government estimated 2 million people were left homeless and the damage was $550 million USD. == References == == Other websites == * 1960 Chilean Tsunami * Surviving a Tsunamiâ€”Lessons from Chile, Hawaii, and Japan Category:1960 Category:20th century in Chile Category:Disasters in the 1960s Category:Earthquakes in Chile Category:Tsunamis Category:1960s in South America",
