 "text": "Douglas DC-3 is an American fixed-wing, propeller airliner designed by Douglas. It was very successful, with 607 DC-3s being built. Even today, some companies still use DC-3’s despite better jet planes being for sale. It was basically a longer version of Douglas’s earlier airplane, the DC-2. It was revolutionary to the airplane market when the DC-3 started being built in 1936, as it could fly farther than most aircraft at the time. During WW2, a military version of the DC-3 known as the C-47 “Skytrain” was the primary transport of the US Military. It was used in major events like D-Day. ==References== Category:Douglas aircraft",
