 "text": "Andrea de Cesaris (31 May 19595 October 2014) was an Italian racing driver. He started 208 Formula One Grands Prix but never won, holding the record for the longest career without a race victory. He was in many car accidents during his career. That earned him the nickname \"Andrea de Crasheris\". He became known for being very fast but also wild. The nickname stuck, though he went on to become a calmer, more mature driver in his later career. In 2005 and 2006 he competed in the Grand Prix Masters formula for retired F1 drivers. de Cesaris died on 5 October 2014 after losing control of his motorcycle on Rome's Grande Raccordo Anulare motorway, aged 55. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Deaths in sport Category:Italian racecar drivers Category:Sportspeople from Rome",
