In a department store a person can usually buy clothing, furniture, electronics, and sometimes paint, hardware, toiletries, cosmetics, photographic equipment, jewellery, toys, and Sports equipment. Department stores are often upmarket places. Some department stores sell products cheaper than other stores. They are then called discount department stores.",
