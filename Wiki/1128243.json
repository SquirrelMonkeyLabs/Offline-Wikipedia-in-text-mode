 "text": "The Palanda rocket frog (Hyloxalus cevallosi) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 18.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 20.6â€“21.0 mm long. There is a line down each side of its body starting at the eye. The female frog has a white belly and the male frog has a gray belly. The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for Don Gabriel Cevallos, a writer, thinker, and history reader. ==Home== This frog lives in forests high in the hills where there is a lot of rain and there is water in the air. It is not good at living in places that humans have changed. People have seen this frog between 480 and 1040 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Hyloxalus do: The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Think people change the places where it lives too much, for example changing forests to farms and places for animals to eat grass and cutting down trees to get wood to build with and making other things people need. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
