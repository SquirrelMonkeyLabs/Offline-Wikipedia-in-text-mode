It was a meeting between Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney and President of the United States Ronald Reagan. It was nicknamed the \"Shamrock Summit\" because both leaders had an Irish background. The meeting is well known because both leaders began to sing the song \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\" with their wives at the Grand Théâtre de Québec in Quebec City at the end of the summit. The leaders discussed military, environment and free trade issues. ==References== Category:1985 in Canada Category:Diplomatic conferences Category:Quebec City Category:Presidency of Ronald Reagan",
