 "text": "The Leader of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition () is the leader of Canada's Official Opposition. It is the party possessing the most seats in the House of Commons that is not the governing party or part of the governing coalition. Pierre Poilievre was the most recent leader of the Opposition following his election as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada in the party's leadership election on September 10, 2022. While the Conservative party will continue to serve as the Official Opposition following the 2025 Canadian federal election, Poilievre lost his seat in the House of Commons, so former Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer was picked to serve again in May 2025. ==Leaders of the Official Opposition== Portrait Name Term of office Party Prime minister Term start Term end Alexander Mackenzie March 6, 1873 November 5, 1873 Liberal Sir John A.
