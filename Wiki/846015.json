 "text": "Jerky is lean and trimmed meat that has been cut into strips and dried (dehydrated) so it will not spoil. Normally, the drying includes adding salt. It prevents the growth of bacteria before the meat has finished the dehydrating process. The word jerky is from the Quechua word ch'arki. The word means \"dried, salted meat\". Store-bought jerky often has sweeteners, like brown sugar. Jerky is ready-to-eat, does not need to be prepared further and can be stored for months without being chilled. Most fat must be trimmed from the meat before drying. Fat increases the chance of spoilage. (Modern vacuum packing and preservatives have helped stop these risks.) The meat must be dried quickly during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. ==References== Category:Snack foods Category:Meat",
