 "text": "Narsimhagupta also known as Narsimhagupta Baladitya was Gupta Emperor from 495 to 530 CE. He was son of Purugupta and successor of Budhagupta. He is known to have played a crucial part in defeating the Huna ruler, Mihirakula in the Battle of Sondani. He was succeeded by his son Kumaragupta III. ==Defeat of Hunas== Chinese monk Xuanzang records that Narasimhagupta paid tribute to Huna king Mihirakula. Subsequently, Baladitya, supported by Yasodharman of Malwa, drove Alchon Huns out of the northern provinces of India. A melodramatic account is rendered by Xuanzang circa 630 CE (ca 100 years afterwards). He mentioned that Mihirakula had overrun nearly the whole of India with the exception of one island on which the king of Magadha, named Baladitya (presumably Narasimhagupta Baladitya), fled for refuge. Later, an Indian king captured Mihirakula but spared his life. Mihirakula then returned to Kashmir and reclaimed his throne. Bhanugupta, who was the governor of Malwa under Narasimhagupta, may have also been involved in this battle. == References == Category:Gupta emperors",
