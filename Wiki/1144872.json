 "text": "Hurricane Kirk, or Storm Kirk in Europe, was a large and powerful storm from Cape Verde that caused lots of damage in bits of Western Europe after turning into a European windstorm. As the eleventh named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, seventh hurricane, and third major hurricane (a major hurricane is a Category 3 or higher on the Saffirâ€“Simpson scale), Kirk formed from a vague area of low pressure. On September 29, Kirk had become a tropical depression. The next day, it had grown to tropical storm status. Conditions were usual for growing, for Kirk had grown to hurricane status on October 4. From rapid growing, Kirk had become to its peak, a Category 4, with wind speeds of 145 miles per hour (mph), or 230 kilometers an hour (km/h). Slowly turning to the northeast, Kirk shrank after peak winds due to cooler temperatures in the ocean, dry air, and wind shear. As it moved towards Western Europe, Kirk had become extratropical as a European windstorm. Also, 6 tornadoes had formed in Western Europe.
