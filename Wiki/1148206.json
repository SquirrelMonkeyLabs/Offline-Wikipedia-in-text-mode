 "text": "Kaniyo Azrael is a rare name from the Bible. He was an angel ('angel of death'), which corresponds with the Hebrew term Malʾakh ha-Maweth. There are so many myths about Azrael (Kaniyo). One of the famous myths about the Kaniyo Azrael angel is that he came to the world to kill bad peoples, rapists, serial killers, etc. All of these are myths. Every 606 years later, the Azrael will reborn on the world and kill the people who hurt peoples who love God. But satanic worshippers believed that Kaniyo ( Azrael ) is satanic Angle . Satanists did Ritual murder for Azrael to bring good fortune and to pacify the gods == Who is the death angel in the Bible? == Death and its relation to Azrael, representing Death and Azrael as former two separate entities, but when God created Death, God ordered the angels to look upon it and they swoon for a thousand years. After the angels regained consciousness, Death recognized that it must submit to Azrael. == Etymology and place in Judaism == The Hebrew Bible does not mention an angel by the name Azrael, nor does it appear in the rabbinic literature of the Talmud or Midrashim. No such angel is treated as canonical in traditional Rabbinic Judaism. However, an angel by a similar name, Azriel (עזריאל), is mentioned in Kabbalistic literature, such as the Zohar. Despite the absence of such a figure in Judaism, the name Azrael is suggestive of a Hebrew theophoric עזראל, meaning \"the one whom God helps\". Archeological evidence uncovered in Jewish settlements in Mesopotamia confirms that it was indeed at one time used on an incantation bowl from the 7th century. However, as the text thereon only lists names, an association of this angelic name with death cannot be identified in Judaism. After the emergence of Islam, the name Azrael became popular among both Christian and Islamic literature and folklore.[citation needed] The name spelled as Ezrā’ël appears in the Classical Ethiopic version of Apocalypse of Peter (dating to the 16th century) as an angel of hell, who avenges those who had been wronged during life. == Interesting things about Kaniyo Azrael == Envisioned as a celestial being, Kaniyo Azrael presents a somber aspect and a very crucial role as the angelic guide in the spiritual worlds. This particular figure has its own unique identity and presence, which clearly sets it apart from the classical Azrael, the Angel of Death, from which it is derived. The Kaniyo Azrael is characterized as a kind and wise being whose primary purpose is to guide people’s souls from the world into the realm beyond. This angel is not only a messenger of death but actually the kind of shepherd who makes sure that everyone understands what is happening at each stage in the end of their life. Kaniyo Azrael will always be with you and is the one that brings comfort to people who are at the end of their lives but strengthens them that it is the end. Adding the title Kaniyo gives this angel a distinctiveness and a uniqueness that will definitely give it a cultural appeal. There is an indication of affiliation to a certain culture or custom, possibly pointing towards one's innate nature, such as gentleness, perseverance, or insight. Kaniyo Azrael does not only assist people in crossing over to the other side but is very concerned and understanding of the struggles that people go through and ensures every person exits in a dignified manner. In many stories, Kaniyo Azrael can be described as the keeper of the psychological realm standing between life and death, a figure who riddles into the depths of the human psyche and its unique facets. Bible: When referencing the Angel of Death, Bible passages never use the name Azrael. Angels are said to cause death, such as in 2 Kings 19 when an angel of the Lord puts many Assyrians to death. Revelation 6 also contains a prophecy about the figure of Death riding out on horseback to destroy part of the Earth == Islam == Before the creation of man, Azrael proved to be the only angel brave enough to go down to Earth and face the hordes of Iblīs, the devil, in order to bring God the materials needed to make man. For this service he was made the angel of death and given a register of all mankind. Along with Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil, Azrael is one of the four major archangels in Islam. He is responsible for taking the souls of the deceased away from the body.Çakmak, Cenap. 2017. Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopaedia, 4 vols. ABC-Clio. . p. 137Houtsma, Martijn Theodoor. [1913–1936] 1987.
