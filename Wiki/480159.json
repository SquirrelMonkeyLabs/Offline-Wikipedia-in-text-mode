 "text": "WrestleMania 32 was the thirty-second yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network livestreaming event made by WWE. It took place on April 3, 2016 at AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas. It was the third WrestleMania to take place in Texas. WWE also hoped that WrestleMania 32 would break the record for people to show up at a wrestling event, aiming for 100,000 people at AT&T; Stadium. At the event they said 101,763 people showed up at WrestleMania 32, breaking 1987's WrestleMania III's record of 93,173. However, wrestling expert Dave Meltzer said only 93,730 people showed up. This still would break WrestleMania III's record. But Meltzer adds that he believes the record was actually held by SummerSlam in 1992 (79,127), while only 78,000 actually showed up for WrestleMania III. Meltzer has also written that WWE would have said the attendance was higher than it actually was because they didn't want to let their fans down. Twelve matches took place at this event and at least two made history. Charlotte went into her match as the WWE Divas Champion, but became the first holder of the new WWE Women's Championship at the end of the match and the Divas title has not existed since. After The Rock defeated Erick Rowan, ring announcer Lilian Garcia said that the match ended in six seconds, a WrestleMania record. The previous record was Kane versus Chavo Guerrero from WrestleMania XXIV which lasted eleven seconds. == Matches == No. Results Stipulations Times 1 Kalisto (c) defeated Ryback Singles match for the WWE United States Championship 8:58 2 Team Total Divas (Brie Bella, Paige, Natalya, Alicia Fox and Eva Marie) defeated Team B.A.D. and Blonde (Lana, Naomi, Tamina, Emma and Summer Rae) 10 diva tag team match 11:25 3 The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso) defeated The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley) Tag team match 5:18 4 Zack Ryder defeated Kevin Owens (c), Sami Zayn, Dolph Ziggler, Stardust, The Miz and Sin Cara Ladder match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship 15:23 5 Chris Jericho defeated AJ Styles Singles match 17:10 6 The League of Nations (Sheamus, Alberto Del Rio and Rusev (with King Barrett) defeated The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) Six man tag team match 10:03 7 Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) defeated Dean Ambrose No holds barred street fight 13:06 8 Charlotte defeated Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks Triple threat match to crown the first WWE Women's champion 16:03 9 The Undertaker defeated Shane McMahon Hell in a Cell match 30:05 10 Baron Corbin won by last eliminating Kane 20-man Andr√© the Giant memorial battle royal 9:41 11 The Rock defeated Erick Rowan (with Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman) Singles match 0:06 12 Roman Reigns defeated Triple H (c) Singles match for the WWE Championship 27:11 == Related pages == * List of WWE pay-per-view events == Footnotes == == References == == Other websites== *WrestleMania 32 on WWE.com Category:2016 in sports Category:2016 in Texas Category:April 2016 events Category:Arlington, Texas Category:Sports in Texas Category:WrestleMania",
