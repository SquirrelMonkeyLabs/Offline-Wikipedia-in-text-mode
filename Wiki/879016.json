 "text": "An attractor state is something that systems do. An attractor state is a way of being or moving that will stay the way it is unless something else comes in and changes it. Systems form attractor states on their own. For example, if a pendulum is swinging in a large clock, and someone taps the pendulum a little, it might stop swinging for a moment, but once the person pulls their finger away, it will go back to swinging. ==References== Category:Mathematics",
