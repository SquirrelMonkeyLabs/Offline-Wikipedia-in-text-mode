 "text": "Ribes is a genus of about 150 species of flowering plants. They are native throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is the only genus in the family Grossulariaceae. Seven subgenera are recognized. Sometimes Ribes is instead put in the family Saxifragaceae. A few taxonomists place the gooseberry species in a separate genus of Grossularia. ==Cultivation== The genus Ribes includes the edible currants (blackcurrant, redcurrant, white currant), gooseberry, and several hybrid varieties. It should not be confused with the dried currant used in cakes and puddings, which is a cultivar of small grape (Zante currant). Ribes gives its name to the popular blackcurrant cordial Ribena. The genus also includes the group of ornamental plants collectively known as the flowering currants, for instance R. sanguineum. == References == current affairs 2020 Category:Fruits Category:Ribes",
