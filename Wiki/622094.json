He was punished by the Revolución Libertadora (The Liberating Revolution) and blamed for receiving favors to travel, so he could not be at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. After that, he represented his native country at two Summer Olympics, in 1960 and 1964. After retiring from his running career, he became a professional athletics coach. ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Long-distance runners Category:Olympians for Argentina Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires",
