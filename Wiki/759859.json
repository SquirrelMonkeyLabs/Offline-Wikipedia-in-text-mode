 "text": "County Dublin is a historical county of Ireland, containing Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland. It is now divided into the counties of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin, and the city of Dublin. The River Liffey runs through the county and city, historically dividing the north and south sides of Dublin. The county has a rich history dating back to early Celtic settlement and was the first part of Ireland to be shired after the Norman invasion in the late 1100s. == References == Category:County Dublin",
