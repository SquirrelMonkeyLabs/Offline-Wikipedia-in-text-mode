 "text": "No Control is the fourth album by American punk rock band Bad Religion. It was released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on November 2, 1989. It was the follow-up to the band's highly acclaimed reunion album Suffer. Like the previous Bad Religion album, many people consider No Control to be one of the best punk albums of the 1980s, while some consider it to be the band's finest effort, featuring \"Change of Ideas\", \"No Control\", \"I Want to Conquer the World\", \"Big Bang\" and \"You\", all of which are staples of their live show to this day. Stylistically, No Control is a faster album than its predecessor, owing more to hardcore punk. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Greg Graffin – lead vocals * Greg Hetson – guitar * Brett Gurewitz – guitar, backing vocals * Jay Bentley – bass guitar, backing vocals * Pete Finestone – drums, percussion * Eddie Schreyer – mastering * Norman Moore – art direction * Pierre Deauville – art direction ==References== Category:1989 albums Category:Bad Religion albums Category:Punk albums",
