It is 7 km (4.3 mi) long and 3.3 km (2.1 mi) wide. The island's highest point is 8.9 metres (29.2 ft) above sea level. 604 people lived on Kihnu in 2007. 69 of them were primary school pupils. There are four villages: Lemsi, Linaküla, Rootsiküla, and Sääre. It is a fifteen-minute plane trip from Pärnu. The ferry from Pärnu or Manilaid takes 3 hours. When the sea is frozen in winter, it is possible to drive to the island over the ice. Kihnu is known for its handicrafts and distinctive traditional clothing, which is still commonly worn today. It includes striped skirts, patterned knit men's sweaters, and knitted mittens. Young women have traditionally organised evening get-togethers to do handicrafts. UNESCO proclaimed Kihnu's traditions a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003. ==References== Category:Islands of Estonia",
