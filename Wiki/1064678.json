The rest of Borneo belongs to Brunei and East Malaysia. In Indonesia, \"Kalimantan\" means the whole island of Borneo. The Indonesian Kalimantan is divided into five provinces. It used to be one province until 1956 when it split into three â€“ East Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan. In 1957, Central Kalimantan became its own province. Then, on October 25, 2012, North Kalimantan separated from East Kalimantan, making it five provinces. In 2019, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo suggested moving the capital to Kalimantan, and in January 2022, the Indonesian government agreed to the idea. The move is expected to take around 10 years. == Demographics == Kalimantan is a big place, covering 539,237.77 square kilometers.
