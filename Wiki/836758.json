 "text": "McLaughlin v. Florida is a 1964 United States Supreme Court case that said that U.S. states cannot treat interracial sex differently from sex between people of the same race. The law that was challenged and struck down in this case was a Florida law that banned interracial couples from living together but not couples of the same race. This case, along with the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia, overturned the 1883 case Pace v. Alabama. ==References== Category:1964 in the United States Category:United States Supreme Court cases",
