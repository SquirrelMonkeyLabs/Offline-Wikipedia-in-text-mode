Virginiaâ€™s two land- grant universities: Virginia Tech and Virginia State University run the program. The program has faculty and staff at the two universities, 107 county and city offices, 11 agricultural research and Extension centers, and six 4-H educational centers. ==Related pages== * Cooperative Extension Service * Virginia Tech * Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences * Virginia State University ==References== ==Other websites== * Virginia Cooperative Extension * Shaping Extension's Future Category:Education in the United States Category:1914 establishments in the United States Category:20th- century establishments in Virginia",
