He was the President of the Massachusetts Senate from 1978 through 1996, which is the longest in history. He then became president of the University of Massachusetts. His brother was convicted mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger, who led the Winter Hill Gang. In 2003 he refused to testify in a congressional hearing about communications he had with his then-fugitive brother. Because of that, he was forced to resign from the presidency of the University of Massachusetts. ==References== ==Other websites== * Gitell, Seth. \"Bulger's Denouement.\" Boston Phoenix December 12, 2002.
