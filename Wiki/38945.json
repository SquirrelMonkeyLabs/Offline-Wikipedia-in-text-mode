Stevenage started as a village and people have lived there since Roman times. Some Roman remains were found when the New Town was being built. There are also six Roman round barrows, which is where a local family was buried. In 1281, Stevenage was allowed to have a market twice a week and a fair every year. The fair still takes place every year. == Modern-day Stevenage == Stevenage became the first New Town on 1 August 1946, and was planned with six neighbourhoods. The town centre was the first shopping area in Britain with no traffic. It was opened in 1959 by Queen Elizabeth II. In the town centre there is a clock tower, fountain and a statue called \"Joyride\", which is a statue of a mother and child. It was made by Franta Belsky. In 1999, a millennium countdown clock was put up on the town centre clock tower, which showed how much time was left until the year 2000.
