It lives in the Philippines, in Luzon, Bohol, and Mindanao. People have seen it between 500 and 600 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees near water. It lives in forests that human beings have not changed. This frog lays eggs in foam nests on plants over water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
