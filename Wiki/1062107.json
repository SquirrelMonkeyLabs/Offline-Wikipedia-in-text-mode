 "text": "The SAK Sportanlage Nonntal, also known as SAK-Platz, was a football stadium in the Nonntal district of Salzburg. It was the home of Salzburg's oldest football club, Salzburger AK 1914. ==History== SAK played in Hellbrunn for the first few years after its founding in 1914. In 1921 it found a new home on the Berchtold Grounds in Nonntal. There they played until the facility was demolished in 2007. The first clubhouse was built around 1931 . A wooden stand was built in 1935, but it burned down in October 1949. In 1968/69 a concrete standing stand and the changing rooms underneath were built. On January 4, 2006, the roof of the grandstand, that had been brought from Lehen, collapsed due to heavy snow loads. Because of the poor condition of parts of the facility demolition of the facility and the construction of the Sportzentrum Mitte have been considered since the 1980s. Demolition finally began in August 2007. Today the Unipark Nonntal, a building of the University of Salzburg, is located on the site.
