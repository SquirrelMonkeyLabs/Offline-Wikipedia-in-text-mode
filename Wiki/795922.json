 "text": "Polyneuropathy (poly- + neuro- + -pathy) is damage or disease affecting peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body, featuring weakness, numbness, and burning pain. It usually begins in the hands and feet and may progress to the arms and legs. Sometimes it will spread to other parts of the body where it may affect the autonomic nervous system. Diabetes and some types of Guillain–Barré syndrome can cause this disease. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the nervous system",
