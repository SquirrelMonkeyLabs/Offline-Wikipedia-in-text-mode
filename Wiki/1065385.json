 "text": "The National League for Democracy is a liberal democratic political party in Myanmar (Burma). It started in September 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi is the leader. The party won a substantial parliamentary majority in the 1990 Myanmar general election. However, the ruling military junta refused to recognise the result. It won a landslide victory in the 2015 general election and again in 2020. It was overthrown in a military coup d'Ã©tat in early 2021. In January 2023, the ruling junta made a new law designed to favor the Union Solidarity and Development Party which support them. The NLD announced that it would not re- register as a political party. On 28 March 2023, the NLD was officially dissolved for failing to register, a decision which the NLD rejected as illegitimate. ==References== Category:Political parties in Myanmar",
