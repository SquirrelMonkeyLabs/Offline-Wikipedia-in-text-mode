 "text": "The Click Five (often abbreviated as TC5) is an American rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. The original members, most of them students at Berklee College of Music, started on January 1, 2004, and played in various local venues. They then quickly got the attention of talent scout Wayne Sharp (who had worked with the power pop group Candy). The Click Five made their first recording, a two-song demo session, in early 2004 after successful local touring. They released their debut studio album Greetings from Imrie House in 2005. After vocalist Eric Dill left the group, he was replaced by Kyle Patrick who debuted on their second studio album Modern Minds and Pastimes in 2007. Their third studio album, TCV, was released in Asia in 2010 and to the rest of the world in early 2011. The group broke up in 2013. The band returned in 2025, embarking on the Click 2025 tour and performing at the Playback Music Festival. ==See also== *Billy Squier *Norman Greenbaum *Tijuana Sweetheart *Roc Project Category:2000â€™s American music groups",
