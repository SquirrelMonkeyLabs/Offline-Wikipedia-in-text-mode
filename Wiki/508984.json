Their twin daughters Barbara and Jenna Bush were nine years old. It is not known if the cat had registered to vote. India stayed with George and Laura Bush after Jenna and Barbara left for college. When George W. Bush became President in early 2001, India moved with the family from the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas to the White House. Even while living at the White House, India did not get as much attention from the media as the family's Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. She is shown in the \"Barneycam\" videos made by the White House staff at Christmas. She first starred in Where in the White House is Miss Beazley?, where she was called by her nickname, \"Willie\". The dogs were always more interesting to the White House press during the Bush presidency. They became more famous to the public. India (as \"Willie\") was shown in the March 2008 Architectural Digest, in the East Sitting Hall of the White House.\"At Home with History in the White House\" , Architectural Digest, March 2008: Retrieved 14 July 2015 == Controversy == There was controversy reported in the news in India.
