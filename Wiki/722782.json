Dennis Prager and Allen Estrin started this website in 2009. Prager appears in some of the videos himself. PragerU is suing YouTube for restricting 99 of its videos. PragerU has already lost several lawsuits against YouTube. ==Sources== ==Other websites== * * Category:2009 establishments in the United States Category:Conservatism Category:American websites",
