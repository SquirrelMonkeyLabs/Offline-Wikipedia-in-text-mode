 "text": "The Circle is a reality television series which originated in the United Kingdom. The show is about a group of contestants who move into an apartment building, but do not meet face-to-face. Instead, they communicate through a voice-activated messaging system called \"The Circle\". Players can choose to be themselves or lie and pretend to be a fake person. Throughout the series, the players will \"rate\" each other. The two highest-rated players become \"influencers\" and get to choose someone to eliminate. During the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and the cash prize. Some versions of the show also feature a \"Fan Favourite\" award in which viewers vote for their favourite player to receive to a smaller cash prize. == International versions == Country Title Network Year Presenter(s) Winner Brazil The Circle Brasil Netflix 2020 Giovanna Ewbank Marina Gregory France The Circle Game Alfred Gerbet Romain Ben United Kingdom The Circle Channel 4 2018 Maya Jama & Alice Levine Alex Hobern 2019 Emma Willis Paddy Smyth 2021 Natalya Platonova Celebrity Circle Lady Leshurr United States The Circle Netflix 2020 Michelle Buteau Joey Sasso 2021 DeLeesa St. Agathe James Andre Jefferson 2022 Frank Grimsley Sam Carmona ==References== Category:British reality television series Category:American reality television series Category:French television series Category:Brazilian television series Category:Television series set in London Category:English- language television programs Category:Channel 4 reality television programmes",
