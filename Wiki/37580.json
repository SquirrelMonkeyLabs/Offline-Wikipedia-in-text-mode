 "text": "The Kingdom of England was a country in Western Europe. It was the land in the south of the island of Great Britain. It united with Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the Romans arrived, what is now England, was actually twenty two tribes. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire in Britain, seven kingdoms existed until in 827, Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at Dore, briefly making Egbert the first king to reign over a united England. It ended on 1 May 1707 with the Acts of Union 1707, which added Scotland to the Kingdom to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. ==References== Category:Kingdom of England Category:Wales Category:Former monarchies of Europe",
