 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Yonne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. The arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of the Yonne department are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 891 Auxerre Auxerre 179,922 3,514.6 171 892 Avallon Avallon 47,594 2,209.2 139 893 Sens Sens 114,298 1,703.6 118 ==History== Since its creation, the Yonne department has had few changes: * 1790 : seven districts: Auxerre, Sens, Joigny, Saint-Fargeau, Avallon, Tonnerre and Saint- Florentin; Auxerre was the capital. * 1800 : the seven districts were changed into five arrondissements: Auxerre, Avallon, Joigny, Sens and Tonnerre. * 1926 : the arrondissements of Joigny and Tonnerre were eliminated. ==Related pages== *Arrondissement of Auxerre *Arrondissement of Avallon *Arrondissement of Sens *List of arrondissements of France ==References== Yonne",
