 "text": "The Darwin-Wallace poison frog, espinosa poison frog, turquoise-bellied poison frog, or turquoise-bellied poison arrow frog (Epipedobates espinosai) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.0–17.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 15.2–20.38 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is coffee color or dark red with blue and white marks. The sides of the body are black in color with some light blue. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in forests. It is awake during the day. It hides under dead leaves on the ground. Scientists saw the frog between 858 and 1719 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists have seen the tadpoles in streams and fast waterfalls. They have not seen the females laying eggs, but they have seen male frogs carrying tadpoles on their backs. Other frogs in Epipedobates lay eggs on the ground, and the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== People cut down many trees to make farms, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. Scientists think people might catch this frog to sell as a pet, but scientists do not know if this is a danger to the frog or not. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
