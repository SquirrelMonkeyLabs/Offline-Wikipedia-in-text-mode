 "text": "The New Jersey chorus frog or Cope's tree frog (Pseudacris kalmi) is a frog. It lives in the United States. It lives in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. This frog is 19â€“36 mm long from nose to rear end. It is gray, brown, or green in color with a stripe that goes from over the mouth to under the eye. It has three thick stripes over its back from front to back. This frog lives in places that are wet but not too wet: Flooded places, forests with ditches and vernal pools and patches of water, and in freshwater swamps. When it is time to lay eggs, the male frogs go to vernal pools. These are patches of water made by spring rain and melting snow. They are only there in the spring. They dry up during the summer. The male frogs sing at the pool, and then the female frogs come to them. The female frog lays eggs on the stems of plants in shallow water. The eggs stick together in groups of 8 to 143. The tadpoles swim and grow for two months before becoming frogs. Swimming snakes, foxes, birds, and raccoons all catch and eat this frog. So do animals with bony skins such as crayfish and spiders. Scientists named this frog kalmi for Pehr Kalm, also called Peter Kalm. Kalm was a Swedish explorer who wrote a book called Travels into North America in 1772. He wrote about this frog in the book. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
