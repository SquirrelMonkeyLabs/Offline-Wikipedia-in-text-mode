 "text": "Left-wing anarchism is an extreme kind of left-wing libertarianism. It is a kind of politics that believes capitalism and the government both need to be removed. These anarchists want to end private property because they believe people who own it have unfair power over others. They want a future based on people working to help each other, instead of for money. But they want to make these things happen without using a government. It wants a society where there is no one in charge. Each person does what they need to without others to lead them.Peacock, Adrian. 1999. Two Hundred Pharaohs, Five Billion Slaves. Ellipsis LondonGoodwin, Barbara. 2007. Using Political Ideas. John Wiley & Sons Left-wing anarchism often means the same as socialist anarchism and libertarian socialism.Brooks, Thom.

Comparative Economics in Transforming World Economy. MIT Press. p. 63 == Other types of anarchism == Ulrike Heider, a syndicalist, grouped anarchism into left-wing anarchism, right-wing anarchism (anarcho-capitalism), and green anarchism.Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994. Some other people who study anarchists, including Murray Bookchin, do not agree with her. They say her research was not good enough. Left-wing anarchism is distinguished from free-market anarchismPaul, Ellen Frankel. Miller, Fred Dycus. Paul, Jeffrey. 1993. (no title listed) Cambridge University Press. p. 115 and right-wing anarchism (such as that of Murray Rothbard).Chomsky, Noam. 2003. Chomsky on Democracy & Education. Routledge. p. 398 Chomsky, Noam. Language and Politics. AK Press. p. 153 * Anarcho-capitalism is often not included as real anarchism. But it does combine capitalism with the belief in no government. * Individualism and egoism can be types of anarchism. These kinds of anarchists believe they should be totally free to do what they want, with no police or government to stop them. * There is also a kind of anarchism called Post-leftism. It wants to rebel against left-wing politics from within left-wing ideas. ==References== ==Other websites== * Defining anarchism from An Anarchist FAQ, written by social anarchists * Collectivist- Anarchism and Communist-Anarchism from The Conquest of Power, by Albert Weisbord * The Incredible Lameness of Left Anarchism by Jason McQuinn.
