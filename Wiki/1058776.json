It was the first All Out eventmade by AEW. It is seen as the spiritual follower to the All In event that took place independently in the same arena and helped in the creation of All Elite Wrestling. The main event saw Chris Jericho defeat \"Hangman\" Adam Page to become the very first AEW World Champion. Page hit a Buckshot Lariat and then went for a Dead Eye but Jericho hit Page with the Judas Effect and got the pinfall victory. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter said the event was great and gave the ladder match between the Lucha Brothers and The Young Bucks 5.25 out of 5 stars, saying it was one of the greatest ladder matches of all time. ==Matches== No. Results Stipulations Times 1 Nyla Rose won by last eliminating Britt Baker 21-woman Casino Battle Royale 20:35 2 Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) defeated Angélico and Jack Evans Tag team match 11:35 3 SoCal Uncensored (Christopher Daniels, Frankie Kazarian, and Scorpio Sky) defeated Jurassic Express (Jungle Boy, Luchasaurus, and Marko Stunt) Six-man tag team match 11:45 4 Pac defeated Kenny Omega Singles match 23:20 5 Jimmy Havoc defeated Darby Allin and Joey Janela Three- way Cracker Barrel Clash match 15:00 6 The Dark Order (Evil Uno and Stu Grayson) defeated Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta) Tag team match for a bye in the first round of the AEW World Tag Team Championship tournament 13:40 7 Riho defeated Hikaru Shida Broken Rules match 13:35 8 Cody (with MJF) defeated Shawn Spears (with Tully Blanchard) Singles match 16:20 9 Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Rey Fénix) (c) defeated The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) Escalera De La Muerte for the AAA World Tag Team Championship 24:10 10 Chris Jericho defeated Adam Page Singles match to crown the first AEW World Champion 26:25 ==References== Category:2019 in sports Category:2019 in the United States Category:AEW All Out Category:2010s in sports in Illinois",
