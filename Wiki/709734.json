 "text": "Typhoon Krosa was a storm that affected Japan. It was the next typhoon after Lekima, in the 2019 Pacific typhoon season. == Storm history == A tropical depression formed near Mariana Islands on August 5. By August 6, it intensified into a tropical storm, and was named Krosa by the JMA. Tropical Storm Krosa soon became a typhoon, and rapidly intensified to become a category 3-equivalent typhoon on August 8. Upwelling of cooler waters induced weakening thereafter; by August 13, Krosa weakened below typhoon intensity. Krosa continued moving, albeit slowly, towards Japan with little change in intensity. Moderately conducive conditions were unable to aid Krosa in strengthening, and it stayed the same intensity before landfall in Japan. On August 14, Krosa emerged in the Sea of Japan and a few days later on August 16 Krosa transitioned into an extratropical low. == Impact == The typhoon brought torrential rain to parts of Shikoku and Honshu, with accumulations peaking at at Yanase in Kochi Prefecture. Wind gusts reached in Muroto. Rough seas produced by the storm killed two people while flooding killed one other. Fifty-five people were injured in various incidents. Agricultural damage in Japan reached Â¥279.61 million (US$2.64 million). * * * == References == Krosa",
