 "text": "A sausage roll is a savoury dish, popular in current and former Commonwealth nations, consisting of sausage meat wrapped in puff pastry. Although variations are known throughout Europe and in other regions, the sausage roll is most closely associated with British cuisine. It is usually eaten as a snack. ==Composition== Sausage rolls are made from sheets of puff pastry formed into tubes around sausage meat and glazed with egg or milk before being baked. They can be served either hot or cold. In the 19th century, they were made using shortcrust pastry instead of puff pastry. A vegetarian or vegan sausage roll can be made in the same manner, using a meat substitute. ==References== Category:Sausage Category:Snack foods",
