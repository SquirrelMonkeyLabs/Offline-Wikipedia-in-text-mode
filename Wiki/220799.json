This may be readily computed by placing the construction of Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 6:1) at 966 BC, a widely accepted date based on the work of Edwin Thiele in the mid 20th century. From 966 BC count back 2992 years to the first man, as given in the Old Testament record. (1656 Adam to the Flood, 427 to Abraham, 430 to the Exodus, 479 to 1 Kings 6:1.) This places the first man at 3958 BC. 6000 years forward takes one to 2043 AD. == In fiction == * 2043 marks the first contact between humans and the Centaurians in the computer game Alien Legacy. * According to the Acecombat universe, war breaks out between Neucom Inc. and General Resource Ltd.
