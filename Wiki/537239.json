 "text": "Avolar was a Mexican low-cost airline. Its headquarters and largest hub were in Tijuana. It started on September 7, 2005 with one Boeing 737-500 airplane. It was one of the first low-cost airlines in Mexico. By 2008, the airline had 10 Boeing 737 airplanes. It flew to 21 cities throughout Mexico. Avolar suspended flights for 3 days in August 2008 and for 1 day in October 2008. This was due to large debts. Avolar asked to fly to the United States on October 28, 2008. Avolar finally stopped flying on that same day - October 28, 2008. The airline has never flown again since then. ==Gallery== File:Boeing 737-2C3(Adv), Avolar Aerolineas JP6198733.jpg|An Avolar Boeing 737-200 at Mexico City International Airport File:N17309 Boeing 737-3T0 (cn 23360 1147) Avolar Aerolineas.
