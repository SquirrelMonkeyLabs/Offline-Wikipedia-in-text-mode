It was announced as a dwarf planet on June 11, 2008, and the discovery of a moon was announced on April 26, 2016. Makemake is a Trans-Neptunian object, because it orbits the Sun further out than Neptune. Originally the object was given a codename 'Easterbunny' as it was discovered shortly after Easter. The International Astronomical Union gave it the name 136472 Makemake, the creator god of the ancient Easter Island people, to keep its connection with Easter. Makemake appears to be made mainly of ice and rock. However, at its very low temperature, ice is as hard as many types of rock. In 2016, it was discovered that Makemake has a small moon.Parker, Alex Harrison, et al. \"Taking The Measure of Makemake's Moon.\" AAS/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts.

The moon is about 87.5 kilometers across. == References == == Other websites == * MPEC listing for Makemake Category:Dwarf planets",
