He is a professor of economics at John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he teaches economics to university students. == Life and work== Dani Rodrik was born in Istanbul, Turkey to a Sephardic Jewish (Jews who come from Spain) family. He studied at the high schools, Robert College in Istanbul and École Normale Supérieure in Paris and then at the universities, Harvard University and Princeton University in the United States of America learning economics. He graduated from Harvard University and got his Ph.D. and Professorship from Princeton University. Dani Rodrik is one of the most important Turkish economists and has made several important contributions to economics. He looks at international economics, economic development and political economy, and has published many articles about them. The main questions of his research are: what makes a good economic policy and why some governments are better than others in adopting it. He does not like globalization, because he feels it only helps rich people get richer by making poor people poorer and that people lose their jobs. He also thinks that international organizations like the World Bank and the IMF have made it harder for poorer countries to get richer, or even do not allow them to get richer. He writes critical articles against globalization. == Other websites == *Dani Rodrik's home page *Who is Dani Rodrik Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Turkish economists Category:Turkish Jews Category:Jewish academics Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Princeton University alumni Category:People from Istanbul",
