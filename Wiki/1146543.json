 "text": "Somequest is a developer of indie video games, especially in the puzzle genre, from Poland. == Works and games == Somequest made the game Xposed, which was released in 2016 on the PlayStation Store. It was described as \"a tribute to the arcade classics\". Xposed is largely based on the old arcade game from 1981 called Qix. Similar to Qix, the game Xposed tasks the player to draw lines on screen to expose the background picture on each level. An updated version named Xposed Reloaded was released in 2021. Xposed Reloaded is specifically mentioned by the developer to be inspired by Xonix, which is a DOS game (itself similar to Qix) from 1984. Somequest afterwards created mature-themed games based on the same concept. These games feature sexually suggestive backgrounds of women, inspired by manga and hentai artwork. Somequest released Cuties Hacked: Oh no someone stole my photos! in 2022, followed by Celebrities Hacked in 2023 and Beauties Unveiled in 2024. Many DLC (downloadable content) packs have been released for these games. In 2024, Somequest has released Fantasy Beauties, a jigsaw video game with a similar concept of unveiling suggestive pictures.
