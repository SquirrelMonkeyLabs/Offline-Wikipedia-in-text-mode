 "text": "The Generali Arena (till 2010 Franz-Horr-Stadion) is a football stadium in Vienna's Favoriten area. Since 1973, it has been the homeground of FK Austria Wien. It was built in 1925 as České srdce for the SK Slovan Wien, a team of the Czech minority in Vienna. The stadium has a capacity of 13 400 and was till 2010 named after the former president of the Vienna Football Association Franz Horr. ==History== The stadium was built in 1925 for Slovan Wien, a football team of the Czech minority of Vienna. It was called České srdce which means \"czech heart\". It was then the new homeground after the promotion to the first league. It was opened with a tournament with Sparta Prag, 1.Vienna FC, Amateure and Slovan itself. The first official match was Slovan's first in the highest league versus Hertha. Slovan won 1:0. There was a plan to build an ice rink, grounds for the training and a gymnastics space for the Czechs of Favoriten but this was impossible for financial reasons. In 1935, Sk Slovan Wien was dissolved and the stadium was only used for amateur football by AC Slovan Wien. During the Second World War, the stadium was damaged. So the ground did not fit for AC Slovan Wien, which played in the A/league, then the highest in Austrian football. In 1949, the city renovated the stadium and it was used by clubs of the Vienna Football Association. Franz Horr, the chairman, made a contract with FK Austria Wien. They played from 1973 in the stadium. After the death of Franz Horr, the stadium was named after him. Not earlier than 1981, the stadium was renovated. Till then, FK Austria played in other football stadiums in Vienna. In 1982, a north stand was built, in 1987 the west stand, in 1999 the south stand and in 2008 the east stand, which offers standing room only but is the home of the different fan clubs. In 2000, the main office of the club came to the Horr stadium and a contract was signed with the owner who grants a 40-year-long right to the club to use the stadium. Since 2010, the stadium has been called Generali arena, after a sponsor from the insurance business.
