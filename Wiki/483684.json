 "text": "The Legislative Assembly of Ontario is the legislature of the province of Ontario, Canada. It has the second largest number of members out of the provincial legislatures of Canada. It meets at the Ontario Legislative Building in Toronto, the provincial capital. The Assembly was created in 1867 by the British North America Act. The Assembly is unicameral, meaning there is no upper house. There are 124 members of the assembly, who are called Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs). Each member is elected from one electoral district. The party with the most members gets to choose the Premier of Ontario, who leads the government, and the Executive Council of Ontario, which is the cabinet. The leader of the second largest party in the assembly becomes the Leader of the Opposition. The current assembly was elected in the 2018 Ontario general election. The members that were elected are part of the 42nd Parliament of Ontario. ==Seat distribution== The following table shows how many seats each political party has in the legislature. â†“ 83 31 8 1 1 ==References== Category:Government of Ontario Ontario Category:Unicameral legislatures",
