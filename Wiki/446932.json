They show sports highlights, news, analysis programming as well as live sports coverage with basketball, college/university sports, mixed martial arts, professional wrestling, and soccer. The channel was first launched in 1994 and was known as Sportscope. It was relaunched in May 1997 under the name Headline Sports with channel licencing Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. The licence was rewritten by the CRTC to allow live sports programming and because of this, as well as legal issues with U.S. cable news channel CNN Headline News which also had a \"Headline Sports\" segment, the channel became known as The Score Television Network. On October 19, 2012, they were acquired by Rogers Media for $167 million. On July 1, 2013, Rogers renamed the channel Sportsnet 360. ==Programming== *Aftermath *Blue Jays in 30 *Blue Jays Xpress *CIS football & basketball *European Poker Tour *Major League Baseball (Toronto Blue Jays) *Major League Soccer *NCAA football & basketball *Prime Time Sports with Bob McCown *The Ultimate Fighter *Tim & Sid *UEFA Champions League *World Poker Tour *WWE Experience *WWE Raw *WWE SmackDown *WWE Vintage ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:1997 establishments in Canada Category:Canadian television channels",
