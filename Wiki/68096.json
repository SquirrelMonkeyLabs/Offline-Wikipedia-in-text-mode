 "text": "Hindus know that Vishnu had taken many important avataras, and the Varaha avatara was the third avatara of Vishnu in Dashavatara. In this avatara, Vishnu took the form of a wild boar, Varaha is a Sanskrit language word that means a wild boar. The Hindu scriptures tell a story about this avatara. There was a daitya (a demon) named Hiranyaksha. He threw the Earth (called Prithvi by the Hindus) into the waters of the primordial ocean. The Earth was about to sink in the primodial ocean. At this point, Vishnu took the form of a wild boar. He entered the primordial ocean and carried the Earth on its body and brought the earth safely to where it should be in the Solar System and killed Hiranyaksha by stabbing him to death with his tusks and breaking his chest with his mace. Thus, Vishnu as a boar named Varaha saved the Earth from being destroyed to rubble in the primordial ocean by killing Hiranyaksha by stabbing him to death with his tusks and breaking his chest with his mace. category:Hinduism category:Hindu mythology",
