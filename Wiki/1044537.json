 "text": "Neduntheevu or Nedunthivu (; ) (also known by its Dutch name Delft) is an island in the Palk Strait, northern Sri Lanka. This island is named as Delft in the Admiralty Chart. This is different because other places are in Tamil and this name is in Dutch. The island's area is 50 km2 and it is oval-shaped. Its length is 8 km and its maximum width about 6 km. The island was named after the Dutch city of Delft by Rijckloff van Goens. He named all the important islands based on names of Dutch cities. == Epigraphs == Archaeologists from the Maritime Archaeology Unit (MAU) of Central Cultural Fund (CCF) found two Tamil epigraphs, or old writing in rock from 1300-1400. They also found one Sinhala Prakrit epigraph from 0-100 AD. == References == Category:Geography of Sri Lanka Category:Islands of Asia",
