 "text": "Pseudophilautus schneideri is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. People have seen it in only a few places: Kudawa, Pituwela, and Kanneliya. People have seen it between 1100 and 1400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 19.9 â€“ 22.8 mm mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 20.7 mm long. The skin on the top of the frog's head is light brown and the skin on the sides of the frog's head is darker brown. The skin near the eardrum and between the eyes is black in color. The skin of the frog's back is dark brown in color with black spots and dark brown spots. The sides of the body are light brown with dark brown spots. The area near where the legs meet the body is yellow-brown with dark brown spots. The sides of the legs are light brown with dark brown spots. All toes are light yellow-brown with some dark brown. The belly, chest, and front of the neck are pale brown in color. Scientists named this frog after amphibian scientist Christopher J. Schneider, of Boston University. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities, to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
