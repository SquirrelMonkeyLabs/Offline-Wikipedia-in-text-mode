Tozzi represented Brazil at the 1952 Summer Olympics and the 1954 FIFA World Cup. ==Club career== Humberto started his career with a club from his hometown and made the switch to São Cristóvão, a smaller club in Rio de Janeiro, that same year. A year later he went to Palmeiras where he became top scorer of the Campeonato Paulista with 22 goals, a year later he became top scorer again and now hit the nets 36 times, but the club could not win the title. In 1956 he made the switch to the Italian Lazio and played there for four seasons and won the Coppa Italia in 1958. In 1960 he returned to Palmeiras and won the league title with the club. In 1961 he played the final of the Copa Libertadores against Peñarol. He then played for Olaria, Fluminense and Portuguesa. ==International career== In 1952 he was already included in the Olympic selection for the Games in Helsinki. He scored the first goal in the 5-1 victory against the Netherlands. In 1954 he was also in the selection for the 1954 World Cup. He was not used in the group stage, but he was used in the quarterfinals against the Magic Magyars, a match that would go down in the history books as the Battle of Bern. After a fiercely protested penalty kick in favor of Hungary, the match turned into a battlefield, in which dirty mistakes were made. After a red card from the Hungarian József Bozsik and the Brazilian Nílton Santos, Humberto was also sent off in the 79th minute. ==References== Category:1934 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Footballers from Rio de Janeiro",
