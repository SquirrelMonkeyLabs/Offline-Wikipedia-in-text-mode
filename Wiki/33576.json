 "text": "The Uralic languages are a language family. They were originally spoken in Eastern Europe and Asia but originated somewhere in eastern Siberia, near Lake Baikal. There are two modern main kinds: the Samoyedic languages and the Finno-Ugric languages. == Origin == The Proto-Uralic languages and the early Uralic people originated somewhere in eastern Siberia or possibly Northeast Asia. They were closely related to other Siberian and East Asians but also to the Inuit. They migrated into central Siberia and then about 3,000 years ago started to migrate to the Baltic region, in Northeastern Europe. They assimilated many Paleo-European tribes. Genetic and anthropologic studies show that the early Uralic people were similar to various Siberian and East Asian people. == External relations == Several linguists and geneticists suggest that the Uralic languages are related to various Siberian languages and possibly also some languages of northern Native Americans. A proposed family is named Uralo-Siberian. It includes Uralic, Yukaghir, Eskimoâ€“Aleut (Inuit) and possibly Nivkh and Chukotko-Kamchatkan. ==List of Uralic languages== *Finno-Ugric languages **Hungarian **Khanty **Mansi **Estonian **Finnish **Karelian **Livonian **Votic **Ingrian **Saami **Erzya **Moksha **Mari **Udmurt **Komi **Samoyedic languages **Nenets ==References== ==Other weblinks== *",
