 "text": "The President of China (officially President of the People's Republic of China) is the head of state of the People's Republic of China (PRC). On paper, the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited powers. However, in recent years the General Secretary of the Communist Party has also served simultaneously as President. His election to the office makes him paramount leader of China. The office is classified as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post.It is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the Premier. The current President is Xi Jinping. He took office on 14 March 2013. ==References== Category:1950s establishments in China Category:1954 establishments in Asia Category:1975 disestablishments in Asia Category:Disestablishments in China Category:1982 establishments in Asia Category:1980s establishments in China",
