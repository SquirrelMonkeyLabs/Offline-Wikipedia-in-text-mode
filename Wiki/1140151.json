 "text": "Fastfetch (known as `fastfetch` in the command-line) is a command-line tool that displays system information written in C, available in Unix-like systems (FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD), Android, Windows (Windows 7 and later), macOS and SunOS. It is a Neofetch alternative after Neofetch was discontinued on April 26, 2024. ==Naming== The name \"Fastfetch\" combines \"Fast\" and \"Neofetch\", as the name suggests, it is a fast alternative for Neofetch. == Configuration == The Fastfetch configuration is located at `~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc`. It is formatted as JSONC. === Example === ==== Example of the configuration file, with several disabled modules ==== { \"$schema\": \"https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/raw/dev/doc/json_schema.json\", \"modules\": [ \"title\", \"separator\", \"os\", \"host\", \"kernel\", \"uptime\", \"packages\", \"shell\", \"display\", \"terminal\", \"terminalfont\", \"cpu\", \"gpu\", \"memory\", \"swap\", \"disk\", \"locale\", \"break\", \"colors ] } == Release table == === Initial year (2022) === Fastfetch 2022 releases Version Date Notes/bug- fixes 1.0.0 March 20 Initial release, only supported Linux 1.1.0 March 22 Greatly improved detection of media player name 1.1.1 March 23 Fix fastfetch recaching every time if an old cache exists 1.1.2 March 23 Capitalize the first letter of media player if appropriate 1.2.0 March 23 Pretty song output, if the media is a browser playing a video 1.2.1 March 25 Added RPM support 1.2.2 March 25 Released pre-built binaries as tar.gz and zip 1.2.3 March 28 Added OpenSUSE logos 1.3.0 April 22 Image support 1.3.1 April 22 Fix build without ImageMagick enabled 1.3.2 April 23 Fix pre-built .deb package 1.3.3 April 23 Fix pre-built .deb package for real this time 1.3.4 April 27 * Using custom logos in terminals that don't support \\033[14t or \\033[18t once again works * Features: ** Ubuntu flavor detection ** Kubuntu & Deepin logo 1.4.0 May 23 * Features: ** Display images converted to ASCII art as logo, using chafa ** Stretch images by using the --logo-height option * New logos added: ** Red Star OS, Rocky Linux and Devuan * Bugfixes: ** Better calculation of image dimensions ** Better RPM package detection ** Format uptime right, when hours > 0 and minutes = 0 ** Only detect themes for installed GTK versions 1.4.1 May 23 Don't prepend proc with TARGET_DIR_ROOT, should make future packaging for Termux simpler 1.4.2 May 24 * Bugfixes: ** RPM package count on SUSE platforms ** Prepend /var with TARGET_DIR_ROOT 1.4.3 May 24 Detect KDE Plasma version more reliable 1.5.0 June 8 * Modules: ** Vulkan ** OpenGL and OpenCL * Features: ** Detect Bedrock Linux ** Detect packages on Bedrock Linux ** --pipe option ** Logo for Bedrock Linux * Bugfixes: ** Locale detection on Ubuntu and deriviates ** Bolt keys and title, if main color is not set 1.5.1 June 8 Fix --print-logos 1.5.2 June 8 Fix build if ImageMagick is not installed 1.5.3 June 8 Enable LTO by default Fix compile bug when LTO enabled 1.5.4 June 19 * Features: ** Better WSL / WSLg support ** ---error arguments ** Export much more information to host format string ** Expose CPU temp to cpu format string ** Expose GPU temp to gpi format string ** Added logo for Alpine Linux ** Detect termux as terminal * Bugfixes: ** Show GiB instad of GB ** Print the last line of the logo, if it is taller than the info * Refactors: ** Cleaned up header includes ** Build libfastfetch as OBJECT lib, as the linked binary is never needed 1.5.5 June 26 Detect Wayland WM much faster * Bugfixes: ** Wayland backend for resolution working once again ** Plasma values are no longer victims to race conditions 1.5.6 July 3 Don't segfault when connecting to some Wayland compositors 1.6.0 July 26 * Features: ** Detect QT on more DEs than just KDE Plasma.
