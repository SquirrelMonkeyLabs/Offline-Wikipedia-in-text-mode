 "text": "The pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI-derived unit of pressure or stress. It is a measure of perpendicular force per unit area and is equal to one newton per square meter. In everyday life, the pascal is best known from meteorological air-pressure reports, where it happens in the form of hectopascal (1 hPa = 100 Pa).World Meteorological Organization: Manual on the Global Observing System â€“ Volume I, Section 3.3.2.2: \"The hectopascal (hPa), equal to 100 pascals (Pa), shall be the unit in which pressures are reported for meteorological purposes.\" In other cases, the kilopascal is more commonly used such as on bicycle tire labels.ISO 5775: Bicycle tyres and rims One hectopascal corresponds to 0.1 and one kilopascal to about 1% of atmospheric pressure (near sea level). It is named after the French mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal. == References == == Related pages == *Atmosphere (unit) Category:SI derived units Category:Units of pressure",
