 "text": "Middle English literature are to the texts written in the form of the English language known as Middle English, from the late 12th century until the 1470s. During this time the Chancery Standard, a form of London-based English extended throughout the country and the printing press regularized the language. Between the 1470s and the middle of the following century there was a change to early Modern English. The features of the books written did not change totally until the effects of the Renaissance and Reformed Christianity became more obvious in the rule of King Henry VIII. There are three main categories of Middle English literature, religious, courtly love, and Arthurian. However much of Geoffrey Chaucer's work stands outside these.",
