 "text": "Heparin is an anticoagulant (which means it stops blood clots) discovered by Jay McLean and William Henry Howell in 1916. It is generally injected under the skin or into veins. As of now it seems safe to use on pregnant people (30 may 2024). It is identified as a glycosaminoglycan AKA long polysaccharide (what cells are made of) chains consisting of long repeating disaccharide chains. The discoverers first extracted heparin from the guts of animals such as turkey, atlantic salmon, mice, and even humans. The specimen of choice is a fresh, nonhemolyzed (intact red blood cells is broken) plasma anticoagulated by fluorides. Overdose can cause heparin-caused thrombocytopenia, a condition where white blood cells attack platelets (which are in the blood and heal wounds), causing a slower heal time, bad breakdown of tissue in the leg, heart infections, and strokes. Heparin is rated one of the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is valuable and popular with a high rate of success. ==Related pages== * Warfarin * Haemophilia == References == Category:Blood",
