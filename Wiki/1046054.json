 "text": "The Australian Football International Cup (also called the AFL International Cup or simply the IC) is an international tournament in men's and women's Australian rules football that is normally held every three years in Australia. Although it is held in Australia, there is no Australian team in the competition due to Australia being a lot better at the sport than other countries. The most successful country in the International Cup is Papua New Guinea. The Australian Football League (AFL) funds the tournament. In 2023, the AFL confirmed that it would be funding regional tournaments for teams affiliated with the AFL, beginning in 2024. The three tournaments will be the Asia Cup (for Asian countries), the Pacific Cup (for Oceanian countries and South Africa) and the Trans-Atlantic Cup (for European countries, Canada, Colombia and the United States).https://www.afl.com.au/news/986943/afl- confirms-international-regional-events-for-2024 ==References== Category:Australian rules football competitions",
