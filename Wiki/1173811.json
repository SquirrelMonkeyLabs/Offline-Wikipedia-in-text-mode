 "text": "Home Hardware Stores Ltd. is a Canadian chain of hardware stores. They are headquartered in St. Jacobs, Ontario. They have around 1,100 store locations all across Canada. They sell products such as different hardware tools, lumber and materials for building, and furniture. Before the creation of Home Hardware, Walter Hachborn and Henry Sittler helped form a business model that was 100% dealer-owned after 122 independent hardware retailers in Ontario agreed to come together and buy Hollinger Hardware Limited in St. Jacobs, Ontario. This was done to challenge other larger big box retailers at the time. The company was first named Home Hardware on November 9, 1967. In 1999, Home Hardware agreed to purchase Beaver Lumber from Molson Brewery for $68 million. Kevin Macnab was named as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Home Hardware on October 10, 2018. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1964 establishments in Canada Category:Companies based in Ontario Category:Hardware stores of Canada",
