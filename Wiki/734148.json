 "text": "suckless.org is a group of programmers that work on minimalist (small) free software. The software is made to be as simple as possible. The group makes programs that closely follow the UNIX philosophy of \"doing one thing and doing it well\". == History == Anselm R. Garbe started the suckless community. In 2007, Garbe said there's a need for a \"Plan 9 lover's and C hacker Ubuntu\" which comes with the tools needed to create code in C. He suggested calling it 9ubuntu. Later, suckless made stali (Static Linux). Stali is an operating system with statically linked programs that can be run. It adheres to the suckless rules. The program making team follows the rule that \"worse is better\". They follow the KISS principle (\"Keep it simple, stupid\"). == Notable projects == * dwm - window manager * dmenu - keyboard-controlled menu tool * ii - IRC program * sbase - UNIX core utilities (essential tools) * surf - web browser * wmii - window manager * st - terminal emulator * stali - Linux distrubution == Meet-ups == In 2013, the suckless.org community started planning yearly meet-ups.https://suckless.org/conferences/ === suckless.org e.V. === In 2015, the legal entity suckless.org e.V. was created. It was created during a suckless meet-up. Its goal is helping suckless.org and other open source projects. ==Related pages== * Plan 9 from Bell Labs == References == == Other websites == * Official website * Subreddit Category:Free software Category:Websites established in 2002",
