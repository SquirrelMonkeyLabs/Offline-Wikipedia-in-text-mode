 "text": "Social justice warrior (also known as SJW), is a pejorative term for people who support feminism or have left-wing opinions. Originally the term social justice warrior was used by people who generally supported left-wing politics and who were activists for social justice and meant it as a good thing. ==In relation to the video games industry== After the Gamergate controversy where Carl Benjamin and Milo Yiannopoulos accused people who didnâ€™t think video game journalism was being used by feminists to spread political correctness of being social justice warriors, the name became a pejorative for someone who wanted video games and popular culture to be more politically correct or someone who was easily offended. == Sources == Category:Activism",
