The group educates people and uses non- violent methods of action for making Tibet independent. SFT tries to influence public policy decisions within government institutions. It recommends self- determination for Tibet because of Tibet's historical status. It opposes the Chinese government's violation of the Tibetan people's human rights, cultural heritage, environment, language and religion. == References == ==Other websites== *Students for a Free Tibet homepage Category:1994 establishments in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States Category:Human rights organizations in the United States Category:Tibet",
