 "text": "This is a list of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 and located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a hall of fame and museum dedicated to the history of ice hockey. Originally, there were two categories for induction, players and builders, and in 1961, a third category for on-ice officials was introduced. In 1988, a \"veteran player category\" was established in order to \"provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players.\" Eleven players were added into the category, but in 2000 the board of directors eliminated it and those inductees are now considered to be in the player category. As of 2017, there are 271 players, 105 builders and 16 on-ice officials in the Hall of Fame. Eleven of the honourees have been added after their death. ==Members== ===Players=== The Player category has been in existence since the beginning of the Hall of Fame and the first players were added in 1945. Since then, 238 players have been added. For a person to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a player, they must have been retired for a minimum of three years and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. The waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable: Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay (1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuk (1971), Jean Beliveau (1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979), Mario Lemieux (1997) and Wayne Gretzky (1999). Following Wayne Gretzky's retirement, it was announced that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under \"certain humanitarian circumstances\". As of 2007, a maximum of four players can be added in one year but the greatest number of players ever added in a year was 27, in 1962. They were added because the Hall of Fame was trying to induct many pre-NHL era players. 218 of the player inductees are Canadian-born, while only 10 European-born players have been added. The NHL team with the most player inductees is the Toronto Maple Leafs, with 55. Seventy-five defencemen are in the Hall of Fame, more than any other current position, while only 35 goaltenders have been added. In 1988, a \"veteran player category\" was established in order to \"provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players.\" Eleven players were added into the category, but in 2000, the board of directors removed it, and now those inductees are considered to be in the player category.

A Builder is a person who has contributed to the development of the game of hockey, and as the name refers, one who has built the game forward. Since then, 96 builders have been added. For a person to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder, they may be \"active or inactive\" and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. As of 2007, a maximum of two builders can be added in one year.

There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors and by telling them to change the rules for selection. Two lawyers, hired by the league to lead an investigation, recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, although it was soon revealed that Stein had previously decided to turn down the induction. In 1989, Alan Eagleson was added as a builder, but he would resign from the Hall in 1998 after pleading guilty of mail fraud and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars. His resignation came shortly before a vote was held to expel him. ===On-ice officials=== The On-ice official category has been in existence since 1961 and since then fourteen have been added. For an official to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame, they must be retired for a minimum of three years and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. As of 2007, a maximum of one on-ice official can be added in one year.
