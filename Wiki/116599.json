 "text": "Le Mans Cathedral (French: Cath√©drale St-Julien du Mans) is a cathedral built in the Gothic style in the town of Le Mans, France. It is dedicated to Saint Julien; he was the first bishop of Le Mans; he is also buried in the cathedral. It is somewhat unusual in the West. It is often compared to those of Reims and Chartres. Its building was influenced a lot by the cathedral of Bourges. It is also special because its nave is built in Romanesque style, but the choir is built in Gothic style.
