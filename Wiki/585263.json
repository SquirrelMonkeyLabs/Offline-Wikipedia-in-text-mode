 "text": "In the context of engineering, automation is when a device or a machine is changed in such a way that it can fulfill the task it was designed for without the need of human interaction. Very often, this means that the machine is fitted with an additional system which takes control of its functions. For example, a centrifugal governor controls a steam engine. Benefits of automation are that the output of the machine or device are more uniform, and that product quality is improved. A system that is not fully automated needs human interaction is needed: Many of the tasks involved are repetitive and boring. In general, machines are also designed so that humans no longer need to lift heavy weights or do dangerous things. With automation, human intervention is limited or absent. == Images == File:Campo de Criptana Molinos de Viento 2.jpg|A common windmill, the position of the wheel is fixed File:DK Fanoe Windmill01.JPG|Windmill where the wheel can readjust itself, to capture the wind. An additional gear is needed for rotating the wheel (which can be automated). == Related pages == *Industrial Revolution Category:Technology",
