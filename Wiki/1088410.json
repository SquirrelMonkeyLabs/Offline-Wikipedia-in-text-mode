 "text": "The Kina Balu flying frog or masked flying frog (Leptomantis angulirostris) is a frog. It lives in the Philippines, in Luzon, Bohol, and Mindanao. People have seen it between 700 and 1800 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 31 to 33 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 45-51 mm long. There is some webbed skin on the front feet. There are bumps on the skin of the belly and front but not on the back. The frog is gray-green to light brown in color. Some frogs have white spots on the head or middle. There is bright yellow color with black spots on the sides of the body and where the legs meet the body. The chest and belly are white. This frog only lives in forests that have never been cut down. The forests are on mountains and hills. This frog lays eggs in clear, rocky streams. The tadpoles can grow to be 36 mm long. Scientists believe this frog is in only some danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. One of the places it lives is a protected park. This frog's danger comes from humans cutting down the forests where it lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
