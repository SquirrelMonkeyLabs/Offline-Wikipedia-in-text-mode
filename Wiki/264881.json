This is because Severus hated James Potter, Harry's father, because James and his best friend Sirius bullied him when they were both in Hogwarts in their younger years and he sees qualities of his father in Harry. Another reason he hated Harry's father is because he loved a girl called Lily who James took and later becomes Harry's mother. However, in Deathly Hallows Part 2, it is revealed that Snape is in fact a hero. He sacrifices himself to save the wizarding world. Harry recognizes this and names a child after him in honor of his bravery. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * * Alan Rickman at Emmys.com Category:1946 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Actors from London Category:BAFTA Award winning actors Category:Cancer deaths in London Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Emmy Award winning actors Category:English movie actors Category:English stage actors Category:English television actors Category:English voice actors Category:Golden Globe Award winning actors",
