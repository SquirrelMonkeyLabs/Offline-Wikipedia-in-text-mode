 "text": "Alba Longa was a legendary ancient city in Latium, central Italy, traditionally located in the Alban Hills southeast of Rome. According to Roman mythology, it was the birthplace of the twins Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, and was established by Ascanius, the son of the Trojan hero Aeneas. == Foundation and mythological origins == Alba Longa is said to have been founded by Ascanius, who led a group of Trojan exiles to Latium after the fall of Troy. According to Roman myth, Ascanius founded Alba Longa to establish a long-term settlement for his people after initially living in Lavinium. The city was located on the ridge of the Alban Hills, which provided a strategic and defensible position. Tradition holds that Alba Longa was the mother city of Rome, with a line of kings who descended from Ascanius. Among these rulers were Procas, Numitor, and Amulius, with the latter's tyrannical rule leading to the birth of Rome's founders, Romulus and Remus. == Historical background == While the city's exact historical reality is uncertain, Alba Longa was likely a significant Latin settlement in the Iron Age. Archaeological evidence from the Alban Hills indicates the presence of a Latin community with religious and cultural practices that later influenced Rome. Historians believe that the city may have been part of a loose confederation of Latin tribes. Alba Longa is also considered to have been the primary city among the Latin League, a federation of Latin communities that united for religious and military purposes. Over time, Rome grew in power, and according to legend, eventually destroyed Alba Longa, absorbing its people and traditions into Rome. == Destruction and absorption into Rome == According to the historian Livy, Rome destroyed Alba Longa in the 7th century BC during the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome. Tullus sought to consolidate Roman control over Latium, and Alba Longa was a natural rival. Following Albaâ€™s destruction, its people were reportedly relocated to Rome, where they contributed to the Roman population and brought religious and cultural traditions, particularly the worship of Jupiter on the Alban Mount. == Cultural and religious significance == Alba Longa held a key place in Roman religious tradition. The Alban Mount was the location of an annual festival for Jupiter, attended by members of the Latin League. This tradition continued in Rome, where the festival of the Latin Games (Ludi Latini) celebrated the shared heritage of the Latin people. Alba Longa's role as a religious center helped shape early Roman religious practices. The city's priesthoods, cult practices, and festivals were absorbed into the burgeoning Roman state, leaving a lasting legacy on Roman society. == In Roman mythology == Alba Longa is frequently referenced in Roman literature and myth as the link between the Trojan hero Aeneas and the founding of Rome. The stories surrounding its kings, including Numitor and Amulius, as well as the miraculous survival of Romulus and Remus, underscore themes of divine intervention and the destiny of Rome as a preordained city. == Related pages == * Romulus and Remus * Roman mythology * Latin League * Aeneas * Tullus Hostilius == References == Category:Italy",
