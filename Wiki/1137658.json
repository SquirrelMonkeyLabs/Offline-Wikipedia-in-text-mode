 "text": "Aero is a brand of chocolate bar. They are chocolate bars that have been filled with foam which cause the bar to be filled with bubbles because of it being aerated. Aero is owned by Nestlé. The chocolate bar was created by Rowntree's and it would be launched it in 1935. A mint version called a Peppermint Aero would later be launched in 1959. The making of Aero bars stopped when World War II broke out and would return after the war was finished. When they returned, they focused they attention to selling chocolate for everybody. To do this, the company had commissioned oil paintings to be created of fourth women doing everyday things. These women would then come to be known as the \"Aero girls\" and a search was later done to try and find the women who had posed for the painting so the company could better portray its history to the public. Beyond than the United Kingdom, Aero bars are also sold in Ireland, Canada, Australia, Germany, South Africa, and Japan. Aside the original, Aero is also sold in different varieties such as a Chunky bar, chocolate ball versions called Aero Bubbles, and a bar with piece of biscuit in it called Aero Biscuit. They also sell a mousse, drinks, ice cream, and a McFlurry flavour at McDonald's. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1935 establishments Category:Chocolate bars Category:Nestlé",
