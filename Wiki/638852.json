At a party, Linda watches one of Chuck's pornographic movies. She tells him good girls never do things like that. Six months later, Linda bails Chuck out of jail for soliciting prostitution. Chuck is desperate for money. He makes Linda become a porn actress. She soon begins working on a movie, Deep Throat. In the movie, she uses the stage name Linda Lovelace. The movie is a huge hit. It makes over $30,000 in its first week. Linda later poses nude. She attends parties. But Chuck has a violent nature. Linda's life is revealed to not be as perfect as it seems. Chuck chokes Linda during sex. When she asks Chuck to stop, he refuses. He forces her into prostitution at gunpoint. Linda visits her parents to ask if she can move back. She reveals that Chuck has been abusing her. But her mother says no. When Chuck learns that Linda has been talking about a new salary with the movie's director, Gerard Damiano, without telling him, Chuck punishes her by making her shower in freezing water. When Deep Throat becomes a hit, Chuck tries to force Linda into doing another porn movie. But she refuses to do that. He then takes her to a party and forces her to participate in a sexual act with several people. Linda tries to escape from Chuck. But he catches her and sleeps on top of her to stop her from trying again. The following day, she secretly meets a man named Anthony Romano. She tells Romano she wants out of the porn business.
