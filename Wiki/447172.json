 "text": "The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s (commonly dubbed the S&L; crisis) was the failure of 1,043 out of the 3,234 savings and loan associations in the United States. It lasted from 1986 to 1995. In 1996, the General Accounting Office estimated the total cost to be $160 billion, including $132.1 billion taken from taxpayers.Wilentz, Sean. The Age of Reagan, p. 199. The man behind the crisis was Charles Keating. He was sentenced for his involvement of the crisis. Some people blame Ronald Reagan for the crisis because he signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which some might think was a direct result of the crisis. ==References== Category:1986 in the United States Category:1995 in the United States Category:20th century in the United States Category:Presidency of Ronald Reagan",
