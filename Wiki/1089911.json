 "text": "The Gare de l'Est (; English: \"Station of the East\" or \"East station\"), officially Paris Est, is one of the seven large mainline railway station termini in Paris, France. It is in the 10th arrondissement, not far southeast from the Gare du Nord. Opened in 1849, it is currently the fifth-busiest of the six main railway stations in Paris before the Gare d'Austerlitz. The Gare de l'Est is the western terminus of the Paris–Strasbourg railway and Paris–Mulhouse railway which goes to Basel, Switzerland. ==History== The Gare de l'Est was opened in 1849 by the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Paris à Strasbourg (Paris–Strasbourg Railway Company) under the name \"Strasbourg platform\" (Embarcadère de Strasbourg); an official inauguration with President Louis Napoléon Bonaparte took place the next year. The platform corresponds today with the hall for main-line trains. Designed by architect François Duquesnay, it was renamed the \"Gare de l'Est\" in 1854, after the expansion of service to Mulhouse. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Paris Category:1849 establishments in Europe Category:1840s establishments in France",
