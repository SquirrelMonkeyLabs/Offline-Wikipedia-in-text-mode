It is built on the site of the birthplace and home of Mary Anning, the fossil hunter. Her family ran a shop here. The collections show fossils from the surrounding area dating from the Jurassic period. It includes local maritime history, memorabilia, and writers associated with the town such as Jane Austen and John Fowles.Chris Broughton, Curator's Choice: Mary Godwin of the Philpott Museum chooses a dinosaur dung coprolite table , Culture24, UK, 1 March 2009.
