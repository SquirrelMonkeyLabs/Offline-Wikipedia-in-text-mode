 "text": "Kanasana Shrine (金鑚神社) is a Shinto shrine in Kodama County, Saitama Prefecture. It is a Ninomiya, or a second rank shrine in its province after the Ichinomiya, and is commonly called \"Ninomiya-sama\" On November 23rd every year, Kanasana Jinja hosts a festival called Hikiri Shinji, which is also known as the \"firestone festival\" == Architecture == Kanasana Jinja is generally built in a mixed architectural style, which combines elements from different architectural styles. Kanasana Jinja doesn't have a main hall (honden) because the mountain behind the shrine is considered its shintai, or the physical object or natural element where the kami (deity) resides. Similar to Ōmiwa Shrine, Kanasana Jinja relies on a kannabi, which is a location that serves as a symbol of the kami's presence. Kanasana Jinja has a large camphor tree shinboku on its premises that is considered a national treasure. == References == Category:Beppyo shrines Category:Kanpei-taisha Category:Myōjin Taisha Category:Ninomiya Category:Mountain faith Category:Saitama Prefecture",
