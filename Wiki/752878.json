 "text": "Clun (Welsh: Colunwy) is a small town in the south of the county of Shropshire, England. A 2011 census recorded just 680 people living in the town. Clun takes its name from the river upon which it stands. The name derives from an earlier Colunwy and shares its very early British root with the Colne rivers, in Lancashire and Essex, each of which has a town of the same name on its banks. The A488 and B4368 roads cross in the town. Craven Arms, Bishop's Castle (6 miles (10 km) to the north) and Ludlow are the neighbouring Shropshire towns, and Knighton, which is in Powys, Wales, is 7 miles (11 km) to the south. In A Shropshire Lad, A. E. Housman wrote the verse: \"Clunton and Clunbury, Clungunford and Clun, Are the quietest places Under the sun.\" ==Gallery== File:Annual_sheep_auction_at_Clun_(3468631762).jpg|An annual sheep auction in Clun, 1920s File:Clun_post_office_(1293401).jpg|Clun post office, 1910s File:ClunBridge2c.jpg|Clun Bridge over the River Clun Category:Towns in Shropshire Category:Villages in Shropshire",
