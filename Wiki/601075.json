 "text": "Joseph Nyumah Boakai, Sr. (born 30 November 1944) is a Liberian politician who is the 26th President of Liberia since 2024. He was the Vice President of Liberia from 2006 until 2018, serving under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. In 2016, Boakai announced his intention to run for the Liberian presidency in the 2017 general election. He is viewed by many as a safe and uncorrupt candidate. He faced Senator and football star George Weah in the second round, but lost the round to Weah. Boakai ran for president again in 2023 facing Weah again in a rematch, this time narrowly winning. ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Liberia Category:Vice presidents of Liberia Category:Kansas State University alumni Category:Current national leaders",
