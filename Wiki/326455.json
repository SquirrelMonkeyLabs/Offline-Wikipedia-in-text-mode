 "text": "Arthur Bertram Modell (June 23, 1925 â€“ September 6, 2012) was an American businessman and National Football League owner. He was married to Patricia Breslin (1931-2011) from 1969 until her death. Art Modell was the owner of the Cleveland Browns from 1961 to 1995. Due to the team's financial and field troubles, Modell moved the team from Cleveland to Baltimore in a highly criticized move in 1995. However, Modell agreed to let the Browns' history stay. An expansion franchise, the \"reactivated\" Cleveland Browns, would begin play in 1999. With the new Baltimore Ravens, Modell won Super Bowl XXXV. He sold the team to Steve Bisciotti before the 2004 NFL season. Modell died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland on September 6, 2012. ==References== ==Other websites== *Baltimore Business Journal article following Ravens' sale by Modell, 11-10-2003 *Art Modell bio sketch at Baltimore Ravens official website *Ravens' owner Modell suffers mild heart attack, Baltimore Sun, 4-16-2002.
