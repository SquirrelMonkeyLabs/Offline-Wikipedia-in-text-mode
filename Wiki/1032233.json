 "text": "Celebrity Love Island was a British reality television programme that was aired on ITV in 2005 and 2006. == Format == Twelve single celebrities were sent to an island in Fiji in the hope of finding love. Viewers would vote for the couple they would like to see in the \"love shack\" where the two would get to know one another better. In the first series, each week viewers voted celebrities off the island, but in the second, the inhabitants had the final say. The identities of those being kicked out were revealed in the elimination episodes. The prize for the final couple left standing was £50,000 each. == Seasons == === Season 1 === The first series was broadcast in 2005. Many viewers criticised the show and it was seen as a rival for Channel 4's Big Brother. The show was presented by Patrick Kielty and Kelly Brook. Jayde Middlemiss and Fran Cosgrave won the series.
