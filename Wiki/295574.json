 "text": "Doctors Without Borders or Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is a non profitable international medical humanitarian organization created by doctors and journalists in France in 1971. MSF gives emergency aid to people affected by wars, epidemics, famine, natural disasters and man-made disasters, or areas where there is no health care available. It provides this help to all people, regardless of their race, religion or political beliefs. In 1999 Doctors Without Borders was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. On 7 October 2015, President Barack Obama, also Nobel Peace Prize winner and at that time commander in chief, issued an apology to Doctors Without Borders for Kunduz hospital airstrike. ==References== Category:International medical and health organizations",
