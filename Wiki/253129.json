 "text": "Wheel gymnastics is a form of gymnastics which originated in Germany. Wheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel known as the Rhönrad, gymnastics wheel, gym wheel, or German wheel. There are three main categories of exercise in wheel gymnasts. They are: straight line, spiral, and vault. ==History== While being a child, Otto Feick, the son of a blacksmith from Reichenbach, Germany, used to roll down a hill in two wagon tires which inspired him later to invent the wheel gymnastics between 1920-1922. The current wheel gymnastics obtained its final shape in 1974 with the introduction of the PVC coating.SATUS, WASHINGTON (1996), Rhönrad Einmaleins.
