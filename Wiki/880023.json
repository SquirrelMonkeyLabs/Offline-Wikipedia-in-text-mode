 "text": "Agalychnis hulli is a frog that lives in Peru. Scientists have only seen it in one place, but they think it might also live in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 270 and 950 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 37.1 mm long from nose to rear end. It changes color. During the day, the frog's back is light green with some lighter spots, and at night it is either darker green or green-brown with lighter spots. This frog lives in tropical forests that are not too high up in the hills. Scientists have seen this frog sitting on leaves about 4 meters above the ground. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over temporary pools of water (bodies of water that are only there for part of the year and dry up at other times). Scientists have not seen many clutches of eggs, but so far it seems that the female frog does not roll the leaf up into a nest the way some other frogs in Agalychnis do. This frog does not live in habitats that have been changed too much. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
