 "text": "The Calcutta Gauntlet was a march by the army of Siraj ud-Daulah to Fort William, which was captured by Robert Clive. The march took place over two days as the army moved to take up a position east of Cacutta. == Background == Clive encountered the Bengali army of over 60,000 infantry, 40,000 cavalry, and 30 cannons while the British only had around 540 British infantry, 600 Royal Navy sailors, 800 local sepoys, fourteen field guns and no cavalry. For two days, the army marched past Clive's camp to take up a position east of Calcutta. == Attack == The British forces attacked the Nawab's camp during the early morning hours of 5 February 1757. Clive marched his force through the Nawab's camp, despite being under heavy fire from all sides. By noon, Clive's force broke through the besieging camp and arrived safely at Fort William. During the assault, around one tenth of the British attackers were killed. Clive reported his losses at 57 killed and 137 wounded. After the incident, Siraj ud-Daulah sought to make terms with Clive, and surrendered control of Calcutta on 9 February, promising to compensate the East India Company for damages suffered and to restore its privileges. This would be known as the Treaty of Alinagar. == References == == Further reading == * The Life of Robert, Lord Clive by Sir John Malcolm and Clive * Clive: The Life and Death of a British Emperor by Robert Harvey",
