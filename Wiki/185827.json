 "text": "Battle of the year (acronym BOTY) is a worldwide breakdancing tournament held every year. In 1990, Thomas Hergenr√∂ther founded BOTY in Hannover, Germany. There were 9 crews and 400 visitors at that time. As break-dancing became more popular, BOTY grew in size and found a new location in Braunschweig, Germany. Regional BOTY (BOTY France, BOTY Korea and so on) first takes place to choose a single crew that will represent each nation in the upcoming BOTY international. Representing crews compete against each other first in a showcase in which every crew presents their own choreographed performances within 6 minutes or so. According to the rankings of the showcase, 2 semi finals in total between 1st and 4th crew and 2nd and 3rd crew takes place. The final battle follows between the winners of the semi finals to judge the champion crew of the year. Judging Criteria for a showcase include; synchronicity, stage-presence, theme & music and choreography. Criteria for individual B-Boys include; top rock, footwork, freeze and power move. Criteria for a battle include; response, routines, strategy and attitude. == References == *http://www.battleoftheyear.de Category:Dance",
