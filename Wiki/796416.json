 "text": "Morton's toe is a condition wherein the second toe may be or appears longer than the big toe. ==Symptoms== The most common symptom seen in Morton's toe is calluses. The first metatarsal head usually bears most of a person's body weight. However, because the second metatarsal head is farthest forward, the force is transferred there. Pain may also be felt at the foot's arch. In shoe- wearing cultures, Morton's toe leads to several problems. Those with Morton's toe need to wear wide or proper shoes for their feet. Those with Morton's toe also have Greek feet, Royal toe or Morton's foot. ==References== Category:Feet Category:Joints Category:Disorders",
