 "text": "The St. Teresa poison frog (Mannophryne oblitterata) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams on mountains and in low places. People also see it in metal water channels made by human beings. Scientists saw the frog between 131 and 734 meters above sea level. There is one protected park in the place where the frog lives: Guatopo National Park. ==Young== The male frogs hide under rocks and call to the female frogs. Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground near streams. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms and other things. Scientists have not seen any of these frogs with the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on this frog, so they do not know if the fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a danger to this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
