 "text": "Gay liberation is a movement that encourages gay people and lesbians to \"come out\". The movement happened mostly in the 1960s and 1970s. To come out means to publicly show one's sexual orientation to family, friends and others. The movement involved LGBT in North America, Australia, New Zealand and Western Europe. The Stonewall riots of 1969 led up to the new movement. Gays and lesbians began to protest bad treatment. They began to \"come out\" because they were angry and upset. Category:LGBT rights",
