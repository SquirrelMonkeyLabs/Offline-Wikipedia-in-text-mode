It is the only genus of the family Blochiidae in the order Istiophoriformes. == Description == Blochius had a slender body reminiscent of a needlefish. Just like a swordfish, it had a pointy snout. It was small and thin, but attacked prey like a modern-day needlefish. == Classification == === Naming === This fish was first mentioned by Swiss scientist Johann Jakob Scheuchzer, who found a piece of a Blochius skeleton. Later, in 1796, Giovanni Serafino Volta gave the fish a scientific name. === Species === Blochius has three species: * Blochius longirostris Volta, 1796 * Blochius macropterus de Zigno, 1887 * Blochius moorheadi Eastman, 1911 (nomen dubium) == Image gallery == == References == # Fierstine, Harry L.; Monsch, Kenneth A.
