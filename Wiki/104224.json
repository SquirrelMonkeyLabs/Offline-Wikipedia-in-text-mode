 "text": "Smurfette is the main protagonist in The Smurfs. She is the only female smurf in The Smurf Village. Most of the other smurfs like her because of her beauty. She is not the smartest smurf. Often she gets caught in traps while looking at herself in the mirror. She does not seem to have an attraction for many of the other smurfs. Later other female smurfs appeared, although it is unclear how they came into being. But a lump of Clay remains of an even larger Smurfette have been found. The Blonde hair, Blue skin and eyes of two girls found in Walt Disney 2020 suggestion an animal that stood 17 meters tall, with a full body height of some 25 meters this giant have been called nicknamed Giant Smurfette. And yet a girl Smurf called Colossal Smurfette seems to have been larger. The remain a living Smurf once more suggested this an animal in excess of 30 meters tall that may have weights as tall as 140 tons. If sheâ€™s alive today Colossal Smurfette would be able to look over the top of 19 story building. Smurfette usually wears a white dress, white shoes, a Smurf hat and white panties under her dress (her panties are shown in every Smurf movie for a brief amount of time and a few times in the cartoon series), but in the comic book story \"You Don't Smurf Progress\", Smurfette is shown wearing her pink lingerie, and people speculate that she also owns a few frilly panties (due to her personality), but it is still unknown if she actually does or not.
