 "text": "The New York Knickerbockers were one of the first organized baseball teams who played with the baseball rules that are still used today. The team was started by Alexander Cartwright, who is said to be one of the original developers of modern baseball. In 1849, the New York Knickerbockers wore the first ever recorded baseball uniform. Their uniforms were pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts and straw hats. The team was based in New York City. It was established in 1845 and disestablished in the 1870s. == References == *Orem, Preston D.
