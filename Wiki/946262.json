 "text": "A general election was held in Italy on 25 September 2022. The 2022 Italian government crisis, which lead to the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi, resulted in President Sergio Mattarella dissolving the Italian Parliament on 21 July, eight months before its natural expiration, and call for new elections. Draghi continues to head the government as caretaker prime Minister. The election saw the centre-right coalition, led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, a political party with neo-fascist roots, winning an absolute majority of Parliament seats. Meloni was appointed Prime Minister of Italy on 22 October, becoming the first woman to hold that position. == Parties and leaders == Coalition Party Ideology Leader/s Seats at last election Seats at dissolution Deputies Senators Total MPs Deputies Senators Total MPs Centre-right coalition League (Lega) Right-wing populism Matteo Salvini Forza Italia (FI) Liberal conservatism Silvio Berlusconi Brothers of Italy (FdI) National conservatism Giorgia Meloni Us Moderates (NM) Liberal conservatism Maurizio Lupi Centre-left coalition Democratic Party Social democracy Enrico Letta Civic Commitment (IC) Centrism Luigi Di Maio Greens and Left Alliance (AVS) Eco-socialism Angelo Bonelli More Europe (+E) Liberalism Emma Bonino Five Star Movement (M5S) Populism Giuseppe Conte Action – Italia Viva (A–IV) Liberalism Carlo Calenda People's Union (UP) Left-wing populism Luigi de Magistris Italexit Euroscepticism Gianluigi Paragone Italia Sovrana e Popolare (ISP) Sovereigntism Marco Rizzo == Results == === Overall results === Coalition Party Party Proportional First-past-the-post Overseas Total seats +/− Votes Party Party % Seats Votes % Seats Votes % Seats Centre-right coalition Brothers of Italy (FdI) 25.99 69 43.79 49 26.00 1 119 League (Lega) 8.77 23 42 1 66 Forza Italia (FI) 8.11 22 23 – 45 Us Moderates (NM) 0.91 – 7 7 Total seats 114 121 2 237 Centre-left coalition Democratic Party (PD) 19.07 57 26.13 8 28.20 4 69 Centre-left coalition Greens and Left Alliance (AVS) 3.63 11 1 4.89 – 12 New Centre-left coalition More Europe (+E) 2.83 – 2 2.76 – 2 Centre-left coalition Civic Commitment (IC) 0.60 – 1 1.07 – 1 New Centre-left coalition Aosta Valley (VdA) 1 1 Total seats Centre-left coalition 68 13 4 85 Five Star Movement (M5S) 15.43 41 15.43 10 8.61 1 52 Action – Italia Viva (A–IV) 7.79 21 7.79 – 5.58 – 21 New South Tyrolean People's Party – PATT (SVP–PATT) 0.42 1 0.42 2 3 South calls North (ScN) 0.76 – 0.76 1 1 New Associative Movement of Italians Abroad (MAIE) 13.04 1 1 Total 400 === Senate of the Republic === ==== Overall results ==== Coalition Party Party Proportional First-past-the-post Overseas Total seats +/− Votes Party Party % Seats Votes % Seats Votes % Seats Centre-right coalition Brothers of Italy (FdI) 26.02 34 44.02 31 27.05 – 65 League (Lega) 8.85 13 17 – 30 Forza Italia (FI) 8.27 9 9 – 18 Us Moderates (NM) 0.89 – 2 2 Total seats 56 59 – 115 Centre-left coalition Democratic Party (PD) 18.96 31 25.99 6 33.98 3 40 Centre-left coalition Greens and Left Alliance (AVS) 3.53 3 1 4 New Centre-left coalition More Europe (+E) 2.94 – – – Total seats Centre- left coalition 34 7 3 44 Five Star Movement (M5S) 15.55 23 15.55 5 9.34 – 28 Action – Italia Viva (A–IV) 7.73 9 7.73 – 6.98 – 9 New South Tyrolean People's Party – PATT (SVP–PATT) 2 2 South calls North (ScN) 0.99 – 0.99 1 1 New Associative Movement of Italians Abroad (MAIE) 12.73 1 1 ±0 Total 200 Category:2022 elections in Europe Category:General elections Category:Politics of Italy Category:2020s in Italy Category:September 2022 events",
