 "text": "The lake bug-eyed frog (Theloderma lacustrinum) is a frog. It lives in Laos. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Ban Naxang Village near the Nam Lik Reservoir. ==Body== The adult male frog is 17.0-20.6 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin on the frog's back is light brown in color with brown and black marks. The frog's belly is gray. The iris of the eye is the color of bronze metal. The frog's DNA shows that it is related to Theloderma lateriticum. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have some evergreen trees in them. It lives near streams. People have seen this frog between 292 and 361 meters above sea level. People see them sitting on leaves 30-80 cm above the ground. When the air is cool and dry, people find it in the lower part of the place where the branches come together like a roof. People also saw it in a water storage lake that used to be a river: the Nam Lik Reservoir. ==Young== Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole because that is what other frogs in Theloderma do. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out, but they think it is in some danger. People cut down forests to make farms, get wood to build with, get good rocks out of the ground, and make roads. Some frogs in Theloderma can live in places that human beings have changed, but scientists think this one needs forests to live in. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
