 "text": "The SS Eastland was a passenger ship based in Chicago and used for tours on the Chicago River. On July 24, 1915, the ship rolled over onto her side while tied to a dock in the Chicago River. A total of 844 passengers and crew were killed in what was the largest loss of life from a single shipwreck on the Great Lakes. After the disaster, Eastland was saved and sold to the United States Navy. After restorations and modifications, Eastland was designated a gunboat and renamed USS Wilmette. She was used primarily as a training vessel on the Great Lakes, and was scrapped after World War II. ==References== Category:History of Chicago Category:20th century in Chicago Category:Shipwrecks Category:Disasters in the United States",
