 "text": "Seoul Jazz Festival (SJF for short) is Korea's largest jazz festival, which began in 2007 and is held every May. (It was not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.) It was performed at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Gwanghwamun until 2011, but the place was changed to Olympic Park from 2012. Since the change in the venue, various artists' performances at various indoor and outdoor venues have been changed to a form where visitors can freely choose and enjoy performances according to their tastes. Many famous artists come to SJF. Because SJF is basically a jazz festival, there are quite a few famous artists from the jazz side, and there are many famous artists from the pop part. In 2022, the competition for ticketing was fierce as it was held for the first time in a while. It was sold out in a minute, so participants had a hard time getting tickets. The 2022 SJF was held for 3 days in May 27-29. On the 27th, five teams, Pink Sweats, Baek Yerin, Johnny Stimson, Etham, and Moonchild, performed. On the 28th, six teams, Alec Benjamin, Jose James, Celebrates Bill Withers, AKMU, Johnny Stimson, Ko Sang-ji with Hong Jin-ho and Cho Min-kyu, performed.
