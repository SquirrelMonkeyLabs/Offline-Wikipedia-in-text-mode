 "text": "Mary Ann Nichols, known as Polly Nichols (née Walker; 26 August 184531 August 1888), was the first canonical victim of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper is believed to have murdered and mutilated at least five women in and around the Whitechapel district of London from late August to early November 1888.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 96–113 A person known as the Whitechapel murderer killed two more women, before Nichols was killed. Jack the Ripper most likely did not commit these murders. The murder of Mary Ann Nichols was origininally linked to this series as well. This increased both press and public interest into the criminal activity and general living conditions of the people of the East End of London. == References == Category:1845 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Victims of Jack the Ripper",
