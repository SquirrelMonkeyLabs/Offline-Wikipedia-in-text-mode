 "text": "In mathematics, the difference of two squares is a squared (multiplied by itself) number subtracted from another squared number. Every difference of squares may be factored according to the identity :a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b) in elementary algebra. ==Proof== Starting from the left-hand side, use the distributive law to get :(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-ba-ab-b^2 By the commutative law, the middle two terms cancel: :ba-ab=0 leaving :(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2 The result is one of the most commonly used identities in mathematics. Among other many uses, it gives simple proof of the AMâ€“GM inequality in two variables. The proof holds in any commutative ring. However, if this identity holds in a ring R for all pairs of elements a and b. This means R is commutative. To see this, use the distributive law on the right-hand side of the equation and get :a^2+ba-ab-b^2 For this equation to be equal to a^2-b^2, we must have :ba-ab=0 for all pairs a, and b. So that R is commutative. Category:Algebra",
