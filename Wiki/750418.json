 "text": "The Walensee, also known as Lake Walen or Lake Walenstadt from Walenstadt, is a lake in eastern Switzerland. It is in the cantons of St. Gallen and Glarus. Other towns and villages at the lake include Weesen, Quinten, Quarten, and Murg. The three main rivers leading to this lake are the Seez, Murgbach, and Linth. The last continues its course from Walensee to Lake Zurich. The Schnittlauchinsel, at the eastern end of the lake, is the only island in the Walensee. The Churfirsten range raises steeply on the north side from the lake's level at 419 m to 2,306 m above sea level.
