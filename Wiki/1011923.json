 "text": "Burkholderia is a genus of Pseudomonadota. These bacteria are gram-negative and they are aerobic (require oxygen to grow). They are rod-shaped and are motile, moving using a single or many flagella (tails), except for Burkholderia mallei, which is not motile. Some bacteria in this genus cause disease in humans and animals. Burkholderia mallei causes glanders, a disease mostly found in horses. B. malle must infect a host mammal to live and it is transmitted from one host to another. Burkholderia cepacia, typically found in soil and water, is a pathogen that may cause pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Burkholderia pseudomalle mainly lives in soil and it can cause melioidosis in humans through contact with contaminated soil or water. Scientific classification Domain: Bacteria Phylum: Pseudomonadota Class: Betaproteobacteria Order: Burkholderiales Family: Burkholderiaceae Genus: Burkholderia Yabuuchi et al. 1993 == Microbiology == Burkholderia species are gram-negative bacteria. They are aerobic so require oxygen to grow. Antibiotic resistance is a problem when treating B. mallei and B. pseudomallei infections. == Taxonomy == === Accepted species === Burkholderia genus includes the following species: Burkholderia cepacia complex Burkholderia mallei Burkholderia pseudomallei == References == Category:Gram-negative bacteria",
