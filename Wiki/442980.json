 "text": "The Paradox Hotel Vancouver is a skyscraper that is located in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. It is 188 meters (617 feet) tall and has 63 floors. Once completed, it claimed the title of second largest building in Vancouver behind the Shangri-La tower. Construction for the building was cancelled in 2009. The building used to be named Trump International Hotel and Tower Vancouver. On June 19, 2013, during a press conference, Holborn Group president Joo Kim Tiah and Donald Trump along with his three children unveiled the $360 million Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver. The building opened in the fall of 2016. The hotel featured Vancouver's first pool bar nightclub. The opening was met with protestors boycotts. They were joined by Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson and British Columbia premier Christy Clark. Robertson wrote a letter demanding the Trump name be removed from the building, calling his views \"ignorant\" and that his name did not deserve to be attached to the Vancouver skyline. On August 28, 2020, the hotel went bankrupt and closed. It later removed the Trump branding on December 23, 2021 and changed its name on April 1, 2022 before reopening. ==References== == Other websites == *Official Website *Emporis.com - Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver *SkycraperPage.com â€“ Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver Category:2016 establishments in Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Vancouver Category:Hotels in Canada Category:Skyscrapers in Canada",
