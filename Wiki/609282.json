He is a member of the Hamburg Jauch family, but currently lives in Potsdam, Brandenburg with his wife Thea (Dorothea) Jauch and his four children. Jauch has produced and hosted the prime time TV programme Stern TV, a television news magazine programme, on the private German RTL national TV network since 1990. Jauch together with Thomas Gottschalk is also part of the German TV show Die 2 - Gottschalk und Jauch gegen alle. In 2015, shortly after Stefan Raab had announced the end of his TV career, Jauch declared publicly that he intends to gradually reduce his appearance on TV too; stating that he will eventually give up his political talk show Günther Jauch on ARD and to focus on his other TV shows such as Wer wird Millionär? on RTL. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:German journalists Category:German television presenters Category:Writers from North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Writers from Brandenburg Category:People from Münster Category:People from Potsdam",
