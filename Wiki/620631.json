Sasun Hakobyan (Սասուն Հակոբյան) was chosen to represent Armenia in December 2017. He was selected for the Paralympics before any of the country's Olympic people. The total number of members of the team was five. It included four people who were there to support its skier. The team left for South Korea on 5 March 2018. In late February, Armenian National Paralympic Committee President Hakob Abrahamyan was trying to add one person to the team. He wanted alpine skier Sasun Hakobyan to go to Pyeongchang too. The problem was the skier missed a qualifying competition. Armenia asked the International Paralympic Committee to allow him to compete anyway.

The countries included Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Laos, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Montenegro, and South Korea.
