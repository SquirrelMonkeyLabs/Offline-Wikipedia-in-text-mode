The Apple Watch can do things like measuring a userâ€™s heartbeat and works like a walkie-talkie when used together with an iPhone 5 or a newer iPhone. It can also access the Internet to download and run apps. Because of this, many people call it a \"smartwatch\". The Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015 and quickly became the best- selling wearable device with 4.2 million sold in the second quarter of 2015. The second generation of Apple Watches was released in September 2016: the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2, while the first generation was discontinued. The Apple Watch Series 3 was released on September 22, 2017 alongside the discontinuation of the Apple Watch Series 2. The Apple Watch Series 4 was announced on September 12, 2018. == Features == The Apple Watch works with Apple Pay, a mobile payment service that allows users to use their Apple Watch to pay for things. It was announced at the same event that the watch was announced. It can control the Apple TV, act as a walkie-talkie, and lets users control the iPhone camera. == Related pages == * iPod Nano (6th generation), an iPod that can also be used as a watch. == References == == Other websites == * Official website Category:Apple hardware",
