She was born in New York City and went to Vassar College. As a student reporter there, Rukeyser covered the 1932 Scottsboro trial in Alabama when nine black youths were accused of raping two white girls. Later she reported from Barcelona on the Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War. She protested against the Vietnam War. She was president of the American Center for PEN in the 1970s. Her first book of poems, Theory of Flight won the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition in 1935. Poet Adrienne Rich said that Rukeyser wanted readers \"to enlarge our sense of what poetry is about in the world, and of the place of feelings and memory in politics.” ==Books== *Theory of Flight.
