The combined district is now called North Fayette Valley, with the middle school being in Elgin and the high school in West Union. The school's mascot is now called the Elmer Trinidad (from a combination of the two schools' mascots, the Elmer and the Trinidaddy, respectively). == History == The Sioux and Winnebago Indians had lived there before 1846. After the 1846 Winnebago Treaty, Indians were forced from the area by the US military and moved to Minnesota. In the summer of 1848, a flood of white settlers arrived. Matthew Conner built a log cabin and general store and the settlement was first called \"Shin Bone Valley.\" Surveyor M. V. Burdick renamed the town \"Elgin\" in 1851 in honor of his hometown, Elgin, Illinois. Benjamin Dimond became the postmaster at Elgin in 1852. Later, the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Minnesota Railway came through in 1872, and the Elgin Times newspaper was established in 1875.
