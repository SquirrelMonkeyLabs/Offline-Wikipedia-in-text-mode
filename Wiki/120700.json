 "text": "Oneness Pentecostalism, also known as Apostolic Pentecostalism, is a movement of Christianity that split from the Pentecostal movement, at around 1914. Its followers believe that the Bible was inspired by God. \"Oneness\" means that they believe that God is one being, not three persons (like in the doctrine of the Trinity), and that Jesus is God in human flesh, fully god and fully human. That makes them different from most Unitarians, who say that the son of God was only man. \"Apostolic\" means that they follow the Apostolic doctrine (by the Twelve Apostles in the early Church). \"Pentecostal\" means that they put an emphasis on the moving of the Holy Spirit (like speaking in tongues) as was done on Pentecost. ==References== Category:Pentecostalism Category:Nontrinitarianism",
