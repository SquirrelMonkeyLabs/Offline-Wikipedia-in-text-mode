 "text": "The Argead dynasty (, ) was an ancient Macedonian royal house.Howatson, M.C. and Harvey, Sir Paul. 1989. The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 339. They were the founders and the ruling dynasty of the kingdom of Macedon from about 700 to 310 BCE.Cosmopoulos, Michael B. 1992. Macedonia: An Introduction to its Political History. Winnipeg: Manitoba Studies in Classical Civilization, p. 30 (TABLE 2: The Argeiad Kings). From about 700 BCE, the founder of the dynasty, Perdiccas I, led the people who called themselves Macedonians eastward from their home on the Haliacmon River. Aegae (today Vergina) became the capital, and by the reign of Amyntas I (6th century BCE) Macedonian power extended eastward beyond the Axius (Axiós) River to dominate the neighbouring Thracian tribes. People of the Argead royal house supposedly believed they were descended of Heracles' family. Famous kings included Philip II of Macedon (reigned 359-336 BC) who subdued Greece and famously united the defeated Greek city states as the League of Corinth with the Macedonians as Hegemon, and his son Alexander the Great (reigned 336–323 BC) who led his army along with allied armies to conquer much of the known world at the time, creating a vast Empire stretching from Macedonia and Greece, to Egypt, and the Indus River, also defeating the Persian Achaemenid Empire. The Argead family dynasty ended during the wars of the Diadochi when Alexander IV of Macedon and his mother Roxana were murdered. == List of Kings == * Karanus of Macedon * Koinos of Macedon * Tyrimmas of Macedon * Perdiccas I of Macedon 700-678 BC * Argaeus I of Macedon 678-640 BC * Philip I of Macedon 640-602 BC * Aeropus I of Macedon 602-576 BC * Alcetas I of Macedon 576-547 BC * Amyntas I of Macedon 547-498 BC * Alexander I of Macedon 498-454 BC * Perdiccas II of Macedon 454-413 BC * Archelaus I of Macedon 413-399 BC * Craterus of Macedon 399 BC * Orestes of Macedon 399-396 BC * Archelaus II of Macedon 396-393 BC * Amyntas II of Macedon 393 BC * Pausanias of Macedon 393 BC * Amyntas III of Macedon 393 BC * Argaeus II of Macedon 393-392 BC * Amyntas III of Macedon (restored) 392-370 BC * Alexander II of Macedon 370-368 BC * Ptolemy I of Macedon 368-365 BC * Perdiccas III of Macedon 365-359 BC * Amyntas IV of Macedon 359 BC * Philip II of Macedon 359-336 BC * Alexander the Great (Alexander III of Macedon) 336-323 BC * Philip III of Macedon 323-317 BC (supposedly) * Alexander IV of Macedon 323-309 BC (supposedly) ==References== == Other websites == * List of the Kings of Macedonia Category:Ancient Greek dynasties",
