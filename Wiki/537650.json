 "text": "The Gulf War oil spill happened in January 1991 during the Gulf War when Iraq troops were retreating from Kuwait. Shortly after Coalition forces (made up of 39 countries) started the air campaign against Iraq, Iraqi soldiers opened the valves at the Sea Island oil terminal. This released between five and ten million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulfâ€”the largest oil spill in history. The spill was an environmental disaster. It destroyed the coastal habitats and marine wildlife in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. == References == Category:1991 in Asia Category:1990s disasters in Asia Category:20th century in Iraq Category:1990s in Kuwait",
