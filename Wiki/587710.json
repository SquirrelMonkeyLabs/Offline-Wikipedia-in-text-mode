In North America, he is best known for donating a trophy to be given to Canada's best amateur hockey club. That trophy, a silver cup now known as the Stanley Cup later became the trophy awarded to the champion of the National Hockey League. Lord Stanley bought the cup in 1892 for $50. In 1945, he was one of the first people inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the \"Builders\" category. Stanley Park in Vancouver is named after him and he went to see it on October 26, 1889. During his career, he was the mayor of Liverpool and Preston. ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1908 deaths Category:British mayors Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs Category:Governors-general of Canada Category:Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Category:Politicians from London Category:UK MPs 1865–1868 Category:UK MPs 1868–1874 Category:UK MPs 1874–1880 Category:UK MPs 1880–1885 Category:UK MPs 1885–1886 Category:Lord-lieutenants",
