 "text": "The Tangier International Zone ( Minṭaqat Ṭanja ad-Dawliyya, , ) was an international zone in the city of Tangier, Morocco, which existed from 1924 until 1956. It was surrounded by the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. == History == In 1904, Morocco got divided into three areas controlled by different countries: one by France, one by Spain, and a part called Tangier was made into a special zone. This idea of making Tangier an international zone started because of something called \"capitulations.\" These were agreements that Morocco's rulers, like the sultans, made with foreigners to promise religious freedom and legal protection. Spain had a big say in this plan because it wanted control over parts of Morocco's coast. France and Great Britain also wanted Tangier to stay neutral during wars. However, Tangier didn't become an international zone until 1923. At that time, it was officially made a neutral area where no military actions were allowed. It was governed by eight Western countries. From 1923 to 1956, Tangier had a special international status. People from different countries and backgrounds, like French, American, Italian, Spanish, Belgian, English, and Dutch, as well as Arabs, Berbers, and Jews, could live there peacefully. In 1956 the now independent Morocco annexed Tangier. ==References== Category:1924 establishments Category:1956 disestablishments Category:20th century in Morocco",
