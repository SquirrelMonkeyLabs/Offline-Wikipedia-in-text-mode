 "text": "Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel were an American folk and rock music duo. They were two childhood friends, who became famous in the 1960s. Their songs, including \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\", \"The Sound of Silence\", and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\", all composed by Simon, are still popular to this day. Their free concert in New York City's Central Park in 1981 was the biggest concert ever, with 500,000 people (about the same number as Woodstock). The band broke up in 1970. ==Albums== * Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. * Sounds of Silence * Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme * Bookends * Bridge over Troubled Water * Greatest Hits * The Concert in Central Park ==Sources== Category:Musical groups from New York City Category:American rock bands Category:Folk music groups Category:Musical duos",
