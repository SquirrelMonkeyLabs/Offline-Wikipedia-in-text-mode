An acre-foot is the amount of water it would take to cover an acre of land with water deep. One acre-foot of water is the same as of water. It is about the same amount of water as a 8-lane, 25 m long competition swimming pool. ==Uses== The typical American family uses about 1 acre-foot of water in a year or about per day. In some places in the deserts of the Southwestern United States, water conservation is a rule. In these areas, a normal family only uses 0.25 acre-feet of water per year. Large amounts of water can also be in thousands of acre-feet or TAF. ==References== Category:Units of volume Category:Water infrastructure",
