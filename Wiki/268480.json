 "text": "The Brinell scale is a measure of hardness in materials. It is measured by making a dent in the material and seeing how deep the dent goes with a known amount of force. It is similar to the Mohs' hardness scale, which scratches the material. It is used to test the hardness of metals. Normally, a steel ball is pressed into an object and the dent made is measured. ==References== *. Category:Tests Category:Materials science",
