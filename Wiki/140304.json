 "text": "The Dominion of Pakistan was an independent federal dominion in the British Commonwealth of Nations within the British Empire that was created in 1947 in the partition of British India into two sovereign dominions (the other being the Union of India). The Dominion of Pakistan was under the autonomy of the British Empire and existed as an autonomous region of the Commonwealth. It existed between 14 August 1947 and 23 March 1956 when the dominion was dissolved and Pakistan officially gained full independence from the British Empire and became an independent republic. The dominion included modern-day Pakistan (called West Pakistan) and Bangladesh (East Pakistan). It was supposed to be a homeland for the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent and of the former British India. It became the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956. The eastern part of the country became independent as the People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971.
