This happened at Lake Guatavita, a small lake near modern-day Bogot√°. At night, fires were lit, and the naked torsos of the noblemen were covered in a paste made of gold dust. With the noblemen, the ruler used a raft to navigate to the middle of the lake. There, they sacrificed the valuables, made of gold or precious stones. The king then jumped into the lake, and the gold paste, as well as the other sacrifices went to the bottom of the lake.
