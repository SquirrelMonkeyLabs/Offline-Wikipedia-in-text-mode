In December 2011, the BBC's Steven Moffat confirmed that Amy and Rory would be leaving the series in 2012 in \"heartbreaking\" circumstances. ==Character creation== Doctor Who executive producer and main writer Steven Moffat came up with the name for the character. In an interview with Kat Angus of Dose magazine, Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies said, \"So when the new series starts next year with the new Doctor, you don’t just get Matt Smith coming on, you also get Karen Gillan as his new companion. I think Amy Pond will be hugely welcomed, because ... I think he does need someone. A lot of these stories prove that. There’s been a huge, empty space on the TARDIS for a long time now and I think her arrival will be every bit as big as Matt’s. It’s really exciting, and everything I’ve heard about Karen is that she’s brilliant. It’s one of our plans that I’m most pleased with, actually. We’ve held off on companions for a long time, so you’ll get rewarded with a great, big, strong character in Amy Pond, when she arrives. I think that plan’s been good.\" Gillan said in an interview with the Radio Times that she was to play Amy Pond with her natural Scottish accent, She auditioned for the part in both her natural accent and with an English one. Gillan has said that she feels using her Scottish accent better fits the character. ==Casting and initial filming== Gillan, like some of the people who had been the Doctor's companion before her, had already been on Doctor Who in a smaller role. Gillan was a soothsayer in the episode \"The Fires of Pompeii\". It was broadcast in 2008. Steven Moffat said of the casting for the character, : \"We saw some amazing actresses for this part. But when Karen came through the door, the game was up - she was funny, clever, gorgeous and sexy. Or Scottish, which is the quick way of saying it. A generation of little girls will want to be her. And a generation of little boys will want them to be her too.\" Doctor Who executive producer Piers Wenger agreed, \"We knew Karen was perfect for the role the moment we saw her. She brought an energy and excitement to the part that was just fantastic.\" Gillan said she was happy to have been cast in the role. She says, \"I am absolutely over the moon at being chosen to play the Doctor's new companion. The show is such a massive phenomenon that I can't quite believe I am going to be a part of it. Matt Smith is an incredible actor and it is going to be so much fun to act alongside him – I just can't wait to get started.\" The role of the young Amelia was played by Gillan's 10-year-old cousin, Caitlin Blackwood. Gillan asked producers to let her cousin play the part, but Blackwood still had to audition. On set was the first time Gillan and Blackwood had actually met each other.BBC Programme : Dr Who Confidential episode - Call Me the Doctor ==Reception== When \"The Eleventh Hour\" was first shown, two viewers quoted in The Telegraph said that Amy's character was too \"sexy\" for a family programme like Doctor Who. Executive producer Piers Wenger said that Amy was meant to be \"feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number. Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with, but she isn’t promiscuous.\" In an online poll, with 3,000 people, taken in late 2010, Amy Pond was listed as the fifth most popular companion. ==References== ==Other websites== *Amy Pond on the BBC's Doctor Who Series 5 website *The Name's Pond.
