It was the 28th Survivor Series event held by WWE. The event celebrated The Undertaker's 25th anniversary in WWE. Nine matches were performed at the event. In the scheduled main event, Roman Reigns became a world champion for the first time, when he defeated Dean Ambrose in a tournament final to win the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship. However, Sheamus cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Reigns to win the title for a third time (and his fourth world championship overall in WWE). Also, The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) defeated The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper), and Charlotte defeated Paige to keep her WWE Divas Championship. == Matches == === Survivor Series elimination matches === Eliminated Wrestler Eliminated by Method Time Viktor Goldust Pinfall 0:30 Konnor Bubba Ray Dudley 5:27 Neville The Miz 8:40 The Miz Goldust 9:05 Bo Dallas Titus O'Neil 17:20 Stardust D-Von Dudley 18:10 Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Goldust, and Titus O'Neil Eliminated Wrestler Eliminated by Method Time King Barrett Sin Cara Pinfall 7:46 Jimmy Uso Xavier Woods 9:22 Sin Cara Sheamus 10:42 Big E Jey Uso 11:30 Kofi Kingston N/A Countout 11:30 Xavier Woods Sheamus Ryback Pinfall 17:33 Ryback, Kalisto, and Jey Uso === WWE World Heavyweight Championship tournament === == References == == Other websites == * Category:2015 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in Atlanta Category:Survivor Series Category:2010s in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:2015 in American television Category:November 2015 events",
