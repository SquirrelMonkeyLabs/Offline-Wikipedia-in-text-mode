On 20 March, the first case of COVID-19 in the country was confirmed, being a 62 year old foreigner from the United Kingdom. Since 16 March tests are being made in Cape Verde rather than abroad, by the Laboratório de Virologia de Cabo Verde, in Praia. On 17 March, as a contingency measure, Prime Minister José Ulisses Correia e Silva announced the suspension of all incoming flights from the US, Brazil, Senegal, Nigeria, Portugal, and all European countries affected by the coronavirus. ==References== Category:Cape Verde Cape Verde",
