It is in the Chūō Ward of the city and is considered to be one of the oldest shrines in the country. == History == Nihon Shoki, a historical text, states that Ikuta Shrine was established by Empress Jingū during the early 3rd century AD to honor the deity Wakahirume. At that time, two other shrines were also founded: Hirota Shrine, which was dedicated to Amaterasu, and Nagata Shrine, which was dedicated to Kotoshiro-nushi (also known as Ebisu). During the Genpei War, there was fighting in and around Ikuta Shrine. This battle, known as the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani, is commemorated by markers in the forest behind the shrine. However, the shrine's land was much larger in the past, before the city of Kobe was built around it. Because of this, the exact locations of battles and other events can no longer be marked on the shrine's property. == Festivals and events == Two Noh plays, named Ebira and Ikuta Atsumori, which depict stories from the Genpei War, are regularly performed near the Ikuta Shrine. These plays are performed every year during Ikuta's Autumn Festival. == Related pages == * List of Shinto shrines * Twenty-Two Shrines * Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines == Sources == * 生田神社, (Japanese) == Other websites == * Category:Kanpei-chūsha Category:Myōjin Taisha Category:Beppyo shrines Category:Shinto shrines in Hyōgo Prefecture",
