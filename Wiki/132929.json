 "text": "Leucippus or Leukippos (, first half of 5th century BC) was a Greek philosopher. He was an early philosopher of atomism, the idea that everything is made up of many tiny things which always continue to exist, which he called Atoms.Wheelwright P. 1966. The Presocratics. Odyssey Press, p177. Leucippus was born at Miletus or Abdera,The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy, pg. xxiii. Some said Leucippus was from Elea, for his philosophy is associated with the Eleatic philosophers although apparently Epicurus said he never existed.According to Epicurus, as reported in Diogenes Laertius' Life of Epicurus. There has long been a controversy about this. Leucippus may have been the first person to suggest the idea of empty space (a vacuum). It is difficult to know which ideas come from him, and which come from Democritus. == References == Category:Presocratic philosophers Category:5th-century BC births Category:5th-century BC deaths",
