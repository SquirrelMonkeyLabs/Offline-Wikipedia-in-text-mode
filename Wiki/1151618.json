Eichmann was sentenced to death by an Israeli court for his role in the mass murder of 6 million Jews, Roma and Sinti during World War II. Two years later on 1 June 1962, he was hanged in prison. Who carried out the execution of Eichmann remained unknown for decades, for fear of reprisals from his followers. In 1992, his name was made public after an investigation by an Israeli radio station. The following years, he gave several interviews about his time as a prison guard. For example, he said that he had to taste Eichmann's food. In 2010, a documentary was made about Nagar, The Hangman.
