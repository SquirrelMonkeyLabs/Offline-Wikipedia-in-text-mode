 "text": "The Game is the name of a mind game. The goal is not to think about The Game itself. If someone thinks about The Game, they lose. If someone loses, they must tell someone or announce that they \"lost The Game.\" The first known reference of The Game appeared in 1990, though no one is sure how it started, and it will never end. It has lasted for about 30 years and accumulated millions of “players” around the world. A similar game was played by Leo Tolstoy in 1840. The media has reported on The Game in many countries and has guessed the number of players to be in the millions. Please note that you are always playing the game, and you are forced to play it. Once you start, you can't stop. == Rules == # If you don’t know about The Game, you are not playing The Game. A person cannot choose to stop playing after they start. # You can’t talk about The Game to those not in the game. It takes 2 people in the game to put a new person in The Game. Starting in the 2020s, the rules changed to one person talking about The Game and having another person ask what it is to have them forever be apart of The Game. # Once you are told “you lost The Game,” there is sometimes an amount of time between 3 seconds to an hour to forget about The Game. # You can only get someone out by directly telling them they lost The Game. You can never truly win The Game. Anyone who hears someone else say they lost The Game also loses The Game, because they are now thinking about The Game. After losing, you start playing again. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:Cognition Category:Games Category:Internet memes",
