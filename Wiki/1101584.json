They also caused uprisings like the Warsaw uprising (Most of them crushed). == Post-war == The Yalta conference agreed that the western allies would not recognise the government-in-exile, instead, they would recognise the communist provisional government of the Republic of Poland. the resistance would continue to fight the communist regime but would end in 1963. The government would return to Poland in 1990 when the Communist Bloc was ending. == Maps == File:Poland 1930.svg|Map of Poland pre WWII File:Poland 1956-1990.svg|Map of Poland post WWII == Leaders == (as President from 1939–1947) ==References== Category:Government of Poland Category:1940s in Poland",
