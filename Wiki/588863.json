He was a native of Kodiak Island in what is now Alaska (being a member of the Alutiiq people). He received the name Peter when he was baptized as a Christian by Herman of Alaska's missionaries operating to the north. He is said to have been captured by Spanish soldiers working near San Pedro (thought to be San Francisco or somewhere else in southern California). ==References== Category:1815 deaths Category:Christian saints",
