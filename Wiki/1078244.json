 "text": "Peter Jason Quill is a fictional character portrayed primarily by Chris Pratt in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, and based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. He is a Celestial-Human hybrid who was abducted from Earth in 1988 by the Yondu Ravager Clan and raised as one of their members, eventually building a reputation as the notorious intergalactic outlaw Star-Lord. In 2014, he decided to leave the Ravagers and operate individually, unintentionally becoming a key player in the quest for a precious artifact known as the Orb after stealing it from Morag. Following his arrest, he forged an uneasy alliance with fellow inmates Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot, who together formed the Guardians of the Galaxy. They first rallied as a team by stopping Ronan the Accuser from destroying Xandar with the Power Stone. As of 2023, Quill has appeared in six films and the television special The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022). The character and Pratt's portrayal have been met with positive reception. Alternate versions of Quill from within the MCU multiverse appear in Avengers: Endgame (2019), portrayed by Pratt, and in the animated series What If...? (2021), voiced by Brian T. Delaney. == Appearances == === Movie appearances === Year Movie Portrayed by 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy Chris Pratt 2017 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 2018 Avengers: Infinity War 2019 Avengers: Endgame 2022 Thor: Love and Thunder 2023 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 === Television appearances === Year Television series and specials Seasons Episodes Portrayed by 2021-2024 What If...? 3 26 Brian T.
