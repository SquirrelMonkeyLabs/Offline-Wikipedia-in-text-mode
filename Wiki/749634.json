 "text": "Masatake Mori (1937-2017) is a Japanese numerical analyst and a former professor at the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. He is known for his contributions to numerical analysis, especially the invention of the double exponential integration formula (one of the most effective method for numerical integration). He also had several joint studies with Masaaki Sugihara.Mori, M., & Sugihara, M. (2001). The double-exponential transformation in numerical analysis.
