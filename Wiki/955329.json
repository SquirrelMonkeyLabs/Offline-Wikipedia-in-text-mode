 "text": "Phyllodytes maculosus is a frog. It lives in Brazil. It lives in the forest in Bahia and Minas Gerais. People have seen it between 77 and 837 meters above sea level. This frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a big area. This frog lives in the rainforest. This frog lives in bromeliad plants that grow on tree branches high in the place where the tree branches come together like a roof. The female frog lays eggs on the leaves of the bromeliad plants. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water in the bromeliad plant, where they swim and grow. Scientists say the big danger to the frog was all the cutting down of the forest that happened during the past hundred years, but this has slowed down. Now, much of what was forest is now farms and places for animals to eat grass. But in the 1980s, human beings started growing tree farms, which is not as bad for tree frogs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
