Saranac is a retail and services place for farming areas near the village. == History == A Grand Rapids judge named Jefferson Morrison purchased the land where Lake Creek meets the Grand River in 1836. He sold parts of the land to Dwight & Hutchinson from Detroit. They then founded the village together. They named the village Saranac and held a public sale in Detroit to sell lots. Those who bought the lots did not develop their property. This concerned Dwight & Hutchinson, so he gave Cyprian S. Hooker land to build a saw mill. Construction on the mill began in 1837 and it was completed in 1841. Hooker partnered with furniture maker Jerry Stocking. Their business was not successful and the two moved away in 1846. Other villagers followed the two believing the village was doomed. In 1847, a merchant named Ammon Wilson moved in. He set up shop on Stocking's former property. He also built a warehouse to ship wheat to Grand Rapids, which was successful. The village grew around the warehouse. A tavern and a hotel were built soon after. In 1851, proprietors of sold-off lots attempted to rename the township \"Boston\". The name \"Saranac\" returned in 1859 due to its popularity. Schools, stores, and churches were built. In 1857, the first train arrived at Saranac. This resulted with increased growth for the village. == Geography == The United States Census Bureau says the village has a total area of . is land and is water. The village is in the Grand River Valley. The landscape has dense forest and open farmland. The forest lines the Grand River, its floodplains and wetlands.
