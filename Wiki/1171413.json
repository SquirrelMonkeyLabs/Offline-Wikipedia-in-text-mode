 "text": "The Churuguara collared frog (Mannophryne caquetio) is a frog. It lives in the Cordillera de la Costa mountains Falc√≥n in northern Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams on mountains. People also see it near roads, so scientists think it can live in places that human beings have changed. Scientists saw the frog between 750 and 900 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog in one protected park: Cueva de la Quebrada El Toro National Park. ==Young== The male frogs sit near rocks and call to the female frogs. Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground near streams. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is in big danger of dying out and scientists in Venezuela says it is in very big danger. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms and towns and places to raise animals. People also take water from streams and use chemicals to make plants grow, and that can hurt the frog too. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
