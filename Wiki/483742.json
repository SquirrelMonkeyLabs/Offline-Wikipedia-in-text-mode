 "text": "Eastern Air Lines was one of the largest airlines of the United States. It was founded by Eddie Rickenbacker in 1929. It stopped flying in 1991. Eastern was one of the Big Four airlines of the USA, along with American Airlines, United Airlines and TWA. In 2015, Eastern relaunched flights. The company merged with Swift Air in 2017 stating that, \"the transaction is not a purchase of one certificate or merger of two certificates.\" Eastern's last flight was in September of 2017. Swift completed its asset purchase and all remaining Eastern aircraft were transferred to the Swift certificate. In September 2017 Eastern surrendered its certificate to the FAA. The Eastern name will be transferred to Dynamic International Airways, an airline co-owned by Swift ownership. ==References== == Gallery == File:Eastern Air Lines Airbus A300 at St Maarten December 1986.jpg|An Airbus A300 File:Eastern Airlines DC-9-51; N411EA@LGA, June 1987 AYG (5127232628).jpg|A McDonnell Douglas DC-9 File:Lockheed L-1011-1 Tristar, Eastern Air Lines JP7713944.jpg|A Lockheed L-1011 Tristar File:N8158G Boeing 727-25C Eastern Air Lines JFK 09JUL70.jpg|A Boeing 727 File:Eastern Air Lines Boeing 757 Quackenbush.jpg|A Boeing 757 File:Boeing 747-121 N735PA EAL lsd MIA 07.02.71 edited-2.jpg|A Boeing 747 Category:Airlines of the United States Category:1929 establishments in the United States Category:1991 disestablishments in the United States Category:2015 establishments in the United States Category:Companies based in Miami Possibly could be added to",
