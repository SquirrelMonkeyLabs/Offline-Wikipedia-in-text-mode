Slightly over 2.000 people live on an area of about 45 square kilometers. James Cook discovered the island in 1777, but saw no reason to land there. The natives looked hostile. Fletcher Christian landed there in 1789. They founded Fort George on the island, but soon left, because of troubles with the natives. Category:Islands of French Polynesia",
