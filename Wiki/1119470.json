 "text": "Vigesimal (also known as base 20) is a numeral system that uses 10 numbers and 10 letters (20 digits) : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and sometimes K. Vigesimal is related to Kaktovik numerals system, because they both use base 20. Sometimes, they do not use I because I looks like a 1. Examples are 3F is 75 (3 x 20 + 15 = 75) in decimal or 8H is 177 (8 x 20 + 17 = 177) in decimal. If you reach J or K, you put a 1 in front and 0 on everything else. Vigesimal is nearly double of decimal because 40 in vigesimal is 80 in decimal and this only works if the number is between 10-90 (only if they end with 0). ==Numbers from Vigesimal to Decimal== *Left is Vigesimal, Right is Decimal *Also the letter I is in here 0 = 0 1 = 1 2 = 2 3 = 3 4 = 4 5 = 5 6 = 6 7 = 7 8 = 8 9 = 9 A = 10 B = 11 C = 12 D = 13 E = 14 F = 15 G = 16 H = 17 I = 18 J = 19 10 = 20 ==Arithmetic signs== In vigesimal, they may use arithmetic signs to add, subtract, multiply or divide. ===Addition=== For addition, if you want to add 2 vigesimal numbers you do like this: 45 + 8C = CH (Vigesimal) 85 + 172 = 257 (Decimal) ===Subtraction=== For subtraction, if you want to subtract 2 vigesimal numbers you do like this: DH - 8B = 56 (Vigesimal) 277 - 171 = 106 (Decimal) ===Multiplication=== And for short multiplication, if you want to multiply 2 vigesimal numbers you do like this: 1F x 6 = AA (Vigesimal) 35 x 6 = 210 (Decimal) For long multiplication, you do like this: 5A2 x C7 = 37JEE (Vigesimal) 2202 x 247 = 543,894 (Decimal) ===Division=== And for short division, if you want to divide 2 vigesimal numbers you do like this: 5A / 12 = 5 (Vigesimal) 110 / 22 = 5 (Decimal) For long division, you do like this: 6BG / 1CJ = 4 (Vigesimal) 2636 / 659 = 4 (Decimal) ==Related pages== Decimal (Base 10) ==References== Category:Numbering systems",
