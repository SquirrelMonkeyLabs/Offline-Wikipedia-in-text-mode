 "text": "Francisco I. Madero (October 30, 1873 - February 22, 1913) was a reformist politician and writer. He was President of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. He never held any other political office. He started the Mexican Revolution in 1910. This helped overthrow dictator Porfirio DÃ­az. Madero was not able to change all of the government of Diaz. Some people did not like him, because he had removed Diaz from power. For the revolutionary forces, he was not radical enough; these forces thought he should have done more. Victoriano Huerta, a general who had served under Diaz, removed Madero from power in 1913. The general also executed Madero.
