The game was developed further, and its focus is now on collecting pets. Adopt Me! has been visited over 38.32 billion times as of January 2025 The game was created by Uplift Games. ==Game Play == Adopt Me! is about adopting and taking care of different animals. Pets are grouped into 5 classes, based around how common they are and how much you have to pay for it. These groups are common, uncommon, rare, ultra-rare and legendary. Pets grow up from junior to adult. If a player has four adult pets of the same type, they can create a \"neon\" pet, and four neon pets can be combined into a \"Mega-Neon\" pet. Purchases can be made with the currency of Roblox's currency, Robux, and through Adopt Me!'s own currency, Bucks. Bucks can be earned by feeding and taking care of your pet. ==History == Before 2018, Adopt Me! was only about adopting and taking care of children. In 2019, pets were added to the game. The first pet ever added was the blue and pink egg, that hatched the pink cat and blue dog, as more people began playing the game and the game became about adopting pets. In March 2021, the game had been played 20 billion times. == Scams == When trading was added in 2021, Adopt Me became known for scammers who scam people for virtual pets. Some common scams include; Trust trades: When a player gives away their pet to another player (the scammer) who says to \"trust them\" and they will give the pet back though they don't and then leave the game. Join my group/Click the link for free pets: When a player (the scammer) creates a fake link and promotes it in the game tricking others to click on it for free pets though once the player clicks on the link, their login information is taken and used by the scammer to control their account and steal their pets. Spin the wheel: When a player gives away their pets to another player (the scammer) in hopes of them winning a better pet by spinning a virtual wheel only the scammer can see. The scammer often lies to the player and says they lost and takes away their pet and leaves the game. Hacking: When hackers steal the players account information and login to their account and steal their pets. However, if you have been scammed there are a few ways to get your pets back; NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAD BEEN HACKED Firstly, Adopt Me! 's new feature \"Trade History\" allows players to keep records of recent trades ( including trades that caused stolen pets) and which account had stolen them. Then players can choose to report the scammer's account and contact the official Adopt Me! Support Team (found on the Adopt Me! Official website) providing evidence that they had been scammed. If you are successful, then Adopt Me! will return your pets back and ban the scammers account. For further support, players can choose to contact the official Roblox team. ==List of Updates - New Updates Coming Soon!== * On April 1, 2020 Adopt Me! added a pet rock. * In May 2020 Adopt Me! added a \"Pirate Update.\" * On May 28, Adopt Me! added the monkey fairground into the game. * During mid-July, 2020, Adopt Me! added a kitsune pet. * On October 3, 2020, the \"Dinosaur Update\" went live. * On October 28, 2020, Adopt Me! began a Halloween event. * On November 24, 2020, Adopt Me! added the \"Robo dog\" pet. * On December 16, 2020, the \"Winter Update\" was released. * On February 2, 2021 the \"Lunar New Year Update\" was released. * On February 18, 2021 the \"Farm House Update\" was released. * On March 18, 2021 the \"Gift Refresh Update\" was released. * On April 2, 2021 the \"Peacock Update\" was released. ==References== Category:2017 video games Category:Roblox Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Free-to- play video games Category:IOS games Category:Indie video games Category:MacOS games Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Social casual games Category:Virtual pet video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
