 "text": "Fatalism is an idea in philosophy. It can mean one of two things. First, it can be the idea that people do not have free will to make their own choices, that everything has already been decided in advance. This is called fate. There are a few reasons people think this. For example, some people think free will can't exist if God knows the future. and believing in determinism, that certain starting things cause other things later. For instance, geographic determinism is the idea that the part of the world where a person lives determines certain things about his or her later life. The second idea is that people, when faced with something that they don't think they can stop, accept the event rather than try to stop it. The first idea is related to determinism and religion. The second idea is related to psychology. ==References== Category:Life Category:Culture Category:Philosophy Category:Psychology",
