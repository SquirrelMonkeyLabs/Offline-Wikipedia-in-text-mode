 "text": "The People's United Party (PUP) is one of two major political parties in Belize. It is currently the governing party of Belize after success in the 2020 Belizean general election. It won a majority of 26 seats out of 31 in the Belizean House of Representatives. It is a centre-left Christian democratic party. The party leader is Johnny Briceño, who is the Prime Minister of Belize. Despite gains in Belize City in the 2015 election, most notably Kareem Musa’s upset win over Belize City Mayor, Darrell Bradley in the Caribbean Shores constituency, it remained at 11 seats overall thanks to losses in the Cayo and Corozal Districts. The PUP ran in 2020 with Johnny Briceño as it's Leader. Francis Fonseca, who led the party during the past two general elections, resigned from leadership soon after the party’s 2015 loss. ==References== Category:1950 establishments in North America Category:Establishments in Belize Category:Political parties in North America Category:Politics of Belize",
