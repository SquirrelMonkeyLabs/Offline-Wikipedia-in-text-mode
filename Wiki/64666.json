This is often done amongst Muslims for females over the age of puberty.Murphy R.F. 1964. Social distance and the veil. American Anthropologist.

However, some Muslim scholars and activists maintain that the practice of covering the hair with a hijab is not mandated in Islam. * * * * ==Types== The hijab as a headscarf can come in several different types, such as an ordinary veil, which only covers the head, a niqab, a burka also known as an abayah, which covers the entire body, and any form of covering used to veil. There are many styles to wear. The Quran however has no requirement that women cover their faces with a veil, or cover their bodies with the full-body burqa or chador.Tristam, Pierre.
