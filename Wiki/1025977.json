 "text": "Johnstone Strait () is a strait next to the northeast coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. ==Name origin== The Strait was named after James Johnstone by George Vancouver. Johnstone was the master of the armed tender Chatham. In 1792, he proved that Vancouver Island is an island. ==Geography== Ships going from the Strait of Georgia that are leaving to the north of Vancouver Island through the Queen Charlotte Strait like to go through here. They are often going to Prince Rupert, Haida Gwaii, Alaska, or the North Pacific Ocean. Ships going down from those areas to the ports of Vancouver, Seattle, and Tacoma also like to go through this strait. There are no cities or towns along the strait. Telegraph Cove and Robson Bight on Vancouver Island are near the north end of the strait. The village of Sayward at Kelsey Bay is near the middle. ==References== Category:Straits of North America Category:Geography of British Columbia",
