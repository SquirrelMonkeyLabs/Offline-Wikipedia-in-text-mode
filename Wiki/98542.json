 "text": "The Battle of Tannenberg was a decisive engagement between the Russian Empire and the German Empire in the first days of World War I. It was fought by the Russian First and Second Armies and the German Eighth Army between 17 August and 2 September 1914. The battle ended with the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army. The battle took place near Allenstein. The Germans named it after Tannenberg. They wanted to express that they had made good their defeat at the medieval Battle of Tannenberg or (Grunwald). In that 1410 battle the Lithuanians finally defeated the Teutonic Knights. ==Bibliographic references== * . * . * Tannenberg 1914 by John Sweetman.
