 "text": "Hyde Park is a centre city area for homes of north-west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, placed between the University of Leeds and Headingley. It sits in the Headingley and Hyde Park voting area of Leeds City Council, though where the border between Headingley and Hyde Park isn't clear; Victoria Road is usually thought to be its northern limit. Unlike the nearby areas of Burley, Headingley and Woodhouse, Hyde Park was not a village in the past so its borders are unknown. The area is in the centre of the city's student community, being next to Headingley, another big student community. There are also many families, single people and a sizable South Asian community. Before the creation of red brick terraced housing in the end of the Victorian era, the area was where the Leeds Royal Park enjoyment area, quarries, and fields in the estate of the Earl of Cardigan. The Hyde Park name would later include the new places where people live from Hyde Park Corner on the A660, with that area previously being known as Wrangthorn. == References == Category:Leeds",
