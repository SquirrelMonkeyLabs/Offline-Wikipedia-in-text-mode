 "text": "Robert James Ritchie, better known as Kid Rock, (born January 17, 1971) is an American singer, songwriter, and rapper. He has made songs with parts of many different styles of music, including rock, hip hop, heavy metal, and country. ==Early career== Kid Rock grew up in Romeo, Michigan, which is near Detroit. He made his first album, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast, in 1990. However, it did not gain many success. He made several more records over the next few years, but the albums did not make any sells either. By 1998, bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit were becoming popular with music that had both rap and heavy metal. Because Kid Rock was making similar music, the record label Atlantic Records, signed Kid Rock to a contract. In 1998, his album Devil Without A Cause was released. Songs such as Bawitdaba and Cowboy were released, making Kid Rock a star. ==Later career== In 2000, Kid Rock released The History of Rock, an album that mostly had old songs from before he became famous, along with two new songs. He released the album Cocky in 2001, Kid Rock in 2003, Rock n Roll Jesus in 2007, and Born Free in 2010. ==Live performances== Kid Rock is a supporter of people in the United States Military. He has performed several concerts for soldiers, and gave soldiers free copies of his album Born Free. In 2004, Kid Rock performed during the Super Bowl halftime show. Although the show was more controversial for an incident where one of Janet Jackson's breasts was seen on television, Kid Rock was criticized for playing while wearing an American flag. ==United States Senate campaign, 2018== Kid Rock has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the 2018 U.S. Senate election in Michigan. On July 12, 2017, he shared a photo of a \"Kid Rock for US Senate\" yard sign on Twitter. He later confirmed that he is in fact running for the Senate. ==Discography== ===Singles=== *\"All Summer Long\" (2008) ===Studio albums=== *Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast (1990) *The Polyfuze Method (1993) *Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp (1996) *Devil Without a Cause (1998) *Cocky (2001) *Kid Rock (2003) *Rock n Roll Jesus (2007) *Born Free (2010) *Rebel Soul (2012) *First Kiss (2015) *Sweet Southern Sugar (2017) ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Michigan Category:American hip hop singers Category:American rock musicians Category:American country singers Category:American movie actors Category:Writers from Michigan Category:Politicians from Michigan Category:Rappers from Michigan Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
