 "text": "Baking blind is the process of baking a pie crust or other pastry without the filling. Blind baking a pie crust is important when it will be filled with an unbaked filling (such as with pudding or cream pies). Blind baking can also be used if the filling has a shorter baking time than the crust. Blind baking is also used to keep pie crust from becoming soggy because of a wet filling. == References == Category:Baking",
