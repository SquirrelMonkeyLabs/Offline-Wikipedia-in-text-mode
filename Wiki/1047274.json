 "text": "The Cigar Lake Mine is in Canada, Athabasca, Saskatchewan. It is a large high- grade underground uranium mine. It is in the uranium-rich Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. It is at the south-west corner of Waterbury Lake. The deposit was discovered in 1981. It is second in size of high-grade deposits only to the nearby McArthur River mine. Other deposits, such as Olympic Dam in Australia, have more uranium but at lower grades.http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/uranium-factsheet3.pdf == References == Category:Uranium Category:Saskatchewan Category:Mining",
