 "text": "Newcomb's paradox is a thought experiment in philosophy, specifically decision theory. The paradox goes as follows: > Imagine a super-intelligent entity known as Omega, and suppose you are > confident in its ability to predict your choices. (Maybe Omega is an alien > from a planet that's much more technologically advanced than ours.) You know > that Omega has often correctly predicted your choices in the past (and has > never made an incorrect prediction about your choices), and you also know > that Omega has correctly predicted the choices of other people, many of whom > are similar to you, in the particular situation about to be described. > There are two boxes: A and B. Box A is see-through and contains $1,000. Box > B is opaque, and contains either $0 or $1,000,000. You may take both boxes, > or only take box B. > Omega decides how much money to put into box B. If Omega believes that you > will take both boxes, then it will put $0 in box B. If Omega believes that > you will only take box B, then it will put $1,000,000 in box B. > Omega makes its prediction, puts the money in box B ($0 or $1,000,000), > presents the boxes to you, and flies away. Omega does not tell you its > prediction, and you do not see how much money Omega put in box B. > What do you do? == Argument for only choosing box B == If Omega is always right, then Omega would only put $1,000,000 in box B when you choose to take only box B. Since $1,000,000 is more preferable than $1,000, only choosing box B makes the most sense and since Omega is always right, then you should choose box B. == Argument for choosing both boxes == Since Omega has already left, the amount of money in box B will not change based on the decision you make. Regardless of what's in box B, you can always get another $1,000 by walking away by both boxes. Category:Thought Category:Experiments Category:Philosophy Category:Logical paradoxes",
