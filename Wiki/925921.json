 "text": "Dummer is a town in Coos County, New Hampshire, United States. A group of rich Portsmouth investors, including Nathaniel Haven, Mark Hunking Wentworth, and his father, were granted the town by Governor John Wentworth on March 8, 1773. In honor of Massachusetts Governor William Dummer, who in Dummer's War successfully defended the eastern English provinces from the French and Indians, he named it after him. However, it wasn't until 1812 that William Leighton and his family moved to the town from Farmington, New Hampshire, that things became settled. The General Court incorporated Dummer on December 19, 1848. Category:Towns in New Hampshire",
