 "text": "Peter Wang (Chinese: 王孟杰; pinyin: Wáng Mèngjié; November 9, 2002 – February 14, 2018) was an American Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) cadet and high school student killed during the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Broward County, Florida, Wang was a freshman at the time of his death. During the shooting, he helped the students escape the gunfire by holding the exit door open and pushing the victims out. For his actions he was posthumously awarded the ROTC Medal of Heroism and admitted to West Point—a very rare act granted by law to prospective candidates whose actions exemplify the principles promoted by the academy. == Early life == Wang was born on 9 November 2002 in Brooklyn, New York City. He had two younger brothers. He was raised in Broward County, Florida, and attended Pentab Academy from pre-kindergarten to second grade, at a private academy in Miami Gardens. The Wang family once owned a Chinese restaurant across the street from his former private school. Wang attended Westchester Elementary School and Sawgrass Springs Middle School, both Broward County Public Schools, for his secondary education. He began his freshman year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2017, and was an active cadet for the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC). Several other students who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were also members of the JROTC. Wang died in the midst of the 2018 shooting. He was planning to attend the United States Military Academy and contribute \"in the service of our country,\" said his neighbor Jesse Pan. Wang spoke English and Chinese.
