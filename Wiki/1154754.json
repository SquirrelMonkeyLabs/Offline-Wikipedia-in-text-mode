The title was held by monarchs who led Prussia through periods of history, including wars, territorial expansion and the formation of the German Empire in 1871. The kingdom was known for its strong military and efficient government. Prussia was a major influence in Europe, and its leaders played key roles in shaping modern Germany. The last king of Prussia was Kaiser Wilhelm II. He abdicated from the throne in 1918 after Germany's defeat in World War I and following the German Revolution.
