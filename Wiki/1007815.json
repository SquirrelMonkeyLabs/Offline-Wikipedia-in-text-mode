 "text": "The Weining flying frog, black-snouted frog, or black-spotted frog (Zhangixalus nigropunctatus) is a frog. It lives in China. It lives in Sichuan Province and Hubei Province. People have seen it between 2000 and 3150 meters above sea level. People have seen these frogs in shrub places, near the outsides of forests, in rice paddies, and near streams. It lays eggs in pools and ponds. The adult frogs hide in caves during the day and look for food at night. They also spend the winter in mud caves. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. This place has protected parks in it, for example Badagong Mountain National Nature Reserve. This frog is in some danger because people cut down the forests where they live to build farms and roads. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
