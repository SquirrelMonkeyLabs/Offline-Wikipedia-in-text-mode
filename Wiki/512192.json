 "text": "LGBT people living in Afghanistan face legal and social challenges. Being a homosexual, or cross-dressing (wearing clothes usually worn by the opposite gender), are serious crimes in Afghan culture. The punishment for homosexuality has been death penalty since 2021 when the Taliban overthrew the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and brought back the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In rural parts of the country, local villagers take the law into their own hands and punish people. ==Homosexual practices with boys== Even though both society and law try to stop homosexual activities, there is a form of bisexuality (sexual attraction to both sexes) within mainstream Afghan culture. Boys are kidnapped to act as sexual slaves for adult men. This often happens in a military where there is no access to women. It also happens when an adult man gives money or gifts to young boys in return for sexual activity. These acts are accepted because they are not seen as being an act of LGBT identity, but rather an act of male power and dominance. The boys are forced to be the \"female\" partner in the relationship. The boys involved are called Bacha bazi in Dari and there are many them in the big cities of Afghanistan. A law has been passed to stop Afghan male soldiers from having the boys they sexually abuse to live with them. Military members generally do not have access to women, and often boys are kidnapped to be humiliated and raped by adult men. Other boys become prostitutes for adult men, regardless of their sexual orientation. In 2007, reports stated that the practice of bacha bareesh (beardless boys) is still prevalent in parts of northern Afghanistan. This practice involves teenage boys being dressed in women's clothing and made to participate in dance competitions and engage in sexual acts. Homosexuality is often associated with both sexual abuse and prostitution, a popular misconception that affects the laws made in the country. ==References== Afghanistan Category:Afghan society and culture Category:Politics of Afghanistan Category:LGBT in Asia",
