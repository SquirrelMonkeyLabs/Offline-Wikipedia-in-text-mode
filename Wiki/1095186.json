 "text": "Oh My God (later retitled God: The Almighty Question) is a 2009 documentary movie by commercial director Peter Rodger. ==Background== Rodger went to more than 23 countries in two and a half years to interview famous people, like Hugh Jackman and Ringo Starr. He asked them who they thought God was. When his documentary was released in November 2009, not many people watched it. It didn't make much money and was considered a financial failure. The movie ended up costing Rodger about $200,000, money he got from his home's equity. ==References== Category:2009 documentary movies Category:American documentary movies",
