 "text": "Suhaldev or Suheldev Bais was a legendary Rajput king from Shravasti town of India. The Persian Haigiography Mirat-i-Masudi, written in 17th century, popularly mentions him to have defeated and killed the Ghaznavid general Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud at Bahraich in 1034 CE. Subsequent writers spanning from colonial ethnographers to the postcolonial bureaucrats have identified King Suheldevâ€™s caste to be from the Bais clan of the Rajputs. In different versions of the legends, Suhaldev is known by different names, that include Sakardev, Suhirdadhwaj, Suhridil, Suhridal-dhaj, Rai Suhrid Dev, Susaj, Suhardal, Sohildar, Shahardev, Sahardev, Suhar Deo, Sahar Deo, Suhaaldev, Suhildev, Suheldev, Sohal Deo and Suheldeo == References == Category:Castes Category:Rajputs",
