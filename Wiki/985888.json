In 1999, eight years after the death of the founder Ramnath Goenka in 1991, the group was divided between the family members. The southern editions took the name The New Indian Express, while the northern editions, which is based in Mumbai, has kept the original Indian Express name with \"The\" placed before the title. == History == In 1932, the Indian Express was started at Chennai by an ancient medicine doctor, P. Varadarajulu Naidu in his \"Tamil Nadu\" press. After having financial problems, he sold the newspaper to Swaminathan Sadanand, the founder of The Free Press Journal, a national news agency. Sadanand brought many changes along with reducing the price of the newspaper. When another financial problem arises, he sold a part of his stake to Ramanath Goenka as convertible business loans. In 1935, The Free Press Journal finally came to an end. After a lengthy court trial battle with Goenka, Sadanand lost ownership of Indian Express. In 1940, the whole building was destroyed by fire. The Hindu, a rival newspaper, helped somehow in re- launching the paper, by getting it printed temporarily at one of its Swadesimithran's press. In 1952, the paper had a circulation of 44,469. After the death of Ramnath Goenka in 1991, two of his grandsons, Manoj Sonthalia and Vivek Goenka divided the group among themselves. Vivek Goenka looks after the Indian Express Mumbai with all the North Indian editions, and all the Southern editions which were grouped as Express Publications Madurai Limited with Chennai as headquarters went to Manoj Sonthalia. ==Abstract== The Indian Express investigated the progression of 86 national school Board toppers (51 men and 35 women) during the two-decade of 1996-2015.
