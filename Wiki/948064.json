 "text": "Pseudacris (the chorus frogs) is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. They live in North America. They live as far west as the Pacific coast and as far east as the Atlantic coast. The name comes from the Greek word pseudes (false) and akris (locust). Scientists might have named these frogs false-locust because the frog's voices sound like locust's voices: a repeated rasping trill sound. They also might have named these frogs false-Acris because there is another frog genus called Acris. ==Taxonomy== Scientists disagree about which species should be in this genus. Because these frogs can hybridize, meaning make healthy young together, molecular genetic research cannot help much. Frost et al. list 19 species in this genus, and AmphibiaWeb lists 17 species, leaving out P. hypochondriaca and P. sierra: Binomial name and author Common name Pseudacris brachyphona Appalachian mountain chorus frog Pseudacris brimleyi Brimley's chorus frog Pseudacris cadaverina California tree frog Pseudacris clarkii spotted chorus frog Pseudacris collinsorum Collinsesâ€™ mountain chorus frog Pseudacris crucifer spring peeper Pseudacris feriarum upland chorus frog Pseudacris fouquettei Cajun chorus frog Pseudacris hypochondriaca Baja chorus frog Pseudacris illinoensis Illinois chorus frog Pseudacris kalmi New Jersey chorus frog Pseudacris maculata boreal chorus frog Pseudacris nigrita southern chorus frog Pseudacris ocularis little grass frog Pseudacris ornata ornate chorus frog Pseudacris regilla Pacific tree frog Pseudacris sierra Sierran chorus frog Pseudacris streckeri Strecker's chorus frog Pseudacris triseriata western chorus frog or striped chorus frog == Home == Chorus frogs live anywhere in North America from southern Alaska to southern Baja California, and from the Pacific to the Atlantic. ==References== ==Other websites== * [web application]. 2008.
