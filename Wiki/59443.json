 "text": "The European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is a kind of ash tree. It is found throughout Europe and not just Scandinavia. It is a deciduous tree that grows to a height of 20â€“35 metres. ==Uses== Ash wood is very easy to bend. It is therefore the material of choice to make bows. Tennis rackets, and the long poles used for snooker are sometimes made from it. ===Religion=== In Norse mythology, the tree Yggdrasil was a European ash. The tree linked all the nine world, Niflheim and Asgard, amongst others. Below the tree resides Hel as well as the Well of Urd. ==Gallery== Fraxinus excelsior - Ardenne 1b.JPG File:Fraxinus excelsior MHNT.BOT.2007.40.58.jpg|Fraxinus excelsior - Museum specimen Category:Trees Category:Oleaceae",
