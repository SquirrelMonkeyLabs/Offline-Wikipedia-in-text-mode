 "text": "The Red Party is a small political party on the left in Norway. It was started in 2007 and the current leader is Bjørnar Moxnes. Across the country, the Red Party has 193 municipal delegates and 20 county council representatives. It was the biggest party to lose a seat in the 2013 parliamentary election. With 2.4% of the vote and its first-ever seat in the Storting, the party was able to enter Parliament in the 2017 election. The last time a far-left party held a seat in the Storting was in 1993, when the Red Electoral Alliance, the party's predecessor, did so. With 4.6% of the vote in the 2021 parliamentary election, the party secured eight seats in Parliament, its best-ever performance. == Webpage == rødt.no Red",
