Bottom: evolution of the normalised sum of the squares of the errors. Curve fitting is constructing a mathematical function which best fits a set of data points.S.S. Halli, K.V. Rao. 1992.

Jaan Kiusalaas. p21, 24. or smoothing.Numerical methods of curve fitting. Philip George Guest. Page 349. Using interpolation requires an exact fit to the data. With smoothing, a \"smooth\" function is constructed, that fit the data approximately. A related topic is regression analysis,Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Nonlinear Regression. Harvey Motulsky, Arthur Christopoulos.Regression analysis. Rudolf J. Freund, William J. Wilson, Ping Sa. p 269. which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors.
