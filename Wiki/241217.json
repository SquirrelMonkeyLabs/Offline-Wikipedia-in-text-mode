 "text": "A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a high quality computer printer that uses heat to make coloured images. The ink is held on cellophane sheets that are the same size as the paper. A 6\" x 4\" printer would use 6\" x 4\" ink sheets. Each image uses 4 sheets - 3 ink sheets Cyan, Magenta and Yellow and a clear sheet. Since each sheet of ink is printed one at a time, making multiple images takes a long time. The images are very high quality. They waste a lot of ink. This means that the prints are very expensive. Category:Printers",
