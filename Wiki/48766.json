 "text": "Statistical surveys are collections of information about items in a population. Surveys can be grouped into numerical and categorical types. A numerical survey is to get numbers as replies. For example: > How many minutes, on average, do you spend eating breakfast? This survey question is used to generate numbers in minutes. An example of a categorical question is: > What is your favorite color? The categories for this would be yellow, green, purple, etc... which are not numbers. Surveys of human populations and institutions are common in political polling and government, health, social science and marketing research. A survey may concentrate on opinions or factual information depending on its purpose. == Other websites == *American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) *How to design a web-based statistical survey online. *Ajeebo: Web based survey software tools directory *Conducting Web-Based Surveys *Free resources for methods in social research has links to resources for surveys and sampling. *Online Survey Best Practice *Short Courses in Survey Methodology, sponsored by the Joint Program in Survey Methodology (JPSM) - University of Maryland-College Park and University of Michigan-Ann Arbor *The EvaluationWiki - The mission of EvaluationWiki is to make freely available a compendium of up-to-date information and resources to everyone involved in the science and practice of evaluation.
