Its main offices and facilities are located at Unit 906A of the Paragon Plaza Building and at the 3rd Floor of Starmalls EDSA Shaw complex. They are both in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila. Founded in 1994 by the Vera family, it is owned by the Villar Group-backed All Value Holdings Inc. ==History== ===Early years=== The head of Quest Broadcasting, Jose Luis Vera, made Advanced Media Broadcasting System in 1994. It got its Congressional franchise granted the following year. Jinji Buhain helped them buy 103.5 DWCS. They got it from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila. They changed the call sign to DWKX. That started K-Lite, a modern adult station. The station, along with four other Vera-controlled Metro Manila stations - (Jam 88.3, Wave 89.1, Magic 89.9 and 99.5 RT) and the Killerbee provincial network - formed The Radio Partners in the early 2000s before being reorganized in 2011 under the new Tiger 22 Media group. ===Under Villar ownership=== In 2019, AMBS was granted a 25-year legislative franchise extension under Republic Act No. 11253, albeit without President Rodrigo Duterte's signature as the bill lapsed into law after 30 days of inaction. The Vera family and AMBS president Andrew Santiago, however, decided to sell the company to Planet Cable of real estate magnate and businessman-politician Manny Villar after its FM station (K-Lite) was in the red due the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 5, 2022, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) awarded AMBS a provisional authority to operate for the digital Channel 16 frequency (previously assigned to ABS-CBN Corporation) for an 18-month test broadcast period; and for the analog Channel 2 frequency under a temporary assignment for simulcast purposes until analog shut-off in 2023. The construction of AMBS's own digital terrestrial television network in Metro Manila was expected to be completed in July 2022. In June 2022, AMBS Manila began its test broadcast. On September 1, 2022, TV Host Willie Revillame announced that the TV station of AMBS will be named as ALLTV. Initially targeted on October 1, 2022, ALLTV made its soft launch on September 13, 2022, at 12 pm PHT, with plans of expanding it nationwide by the end of the year or even sooner; the grand launch will take place in early 2023. On July 15, 2022, during his contract signing with AMBS, Revillame announced that his variety show Wowowin would return on ALLTV since its final broadcast on GMA Network on February 11, 2022. ====Partnership with ABS-CBN==== On April 15, 2024, ABS-CBN's flagship news programs TV Patrol and TV Patrol Weekend, along with programs from Jeepney TV, morning talkshow Magandang Buhay and later the noontime show It's Showtime, commenced airing on ALLTV. This marked the return of some ABS-CBN programs on channels 2 and 16 in Manila, frequencies previously held by the said content provider. The partnership between ABS-CBN and AMBS was formalized after the two companies signed content agreements on April 23, 2024, which took effect on May 13, 2024. ==Stations== ===Radio=== Branding Callsign Frequency Power kW Location All Radio DWOW 103.5 MHz 25 kW Metro Manila ===Television=== ===Analog=== Branding Callsign Ch. # Power kW (ERP) Station Type Location (Transmitter Site) All TV Manila DZMV-TV 2 30 kW (100 kW ERP) Originating Sgt.
