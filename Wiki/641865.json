The tour started on 25 May 2018, with a free show at House Of Vans in London to celebrate the release of their album, but an early album release party held at iHeartRadio Theatre in New York and other two previous shows (19 May 2018 - The Josie Dye One Year Anniversary Show at Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and 21 May 2018 - Elsewhere, Brooklyn, NY) are generally considered as part of the tour based on their common setlist and stage design. On 10 December 2019, the band announced the official end of the tour with a message posted on their blog. The band performed in over 20 countries, attending more than 150 events. For the very first time since their formation, the band added a live drummer, Jonny Scott, to their touring lineup. === Setlist === While the played setlist was different with each show, the typical setlist contained: # \"Get Out\" # \"Bury It\" # \"Gun\" # \"We Sink\" # \"Graffiti\" # \"Graves\" # \"Miracle\" # \"Under the Tide\" # \"Science/Visions\" # \"Forever\" # \"Recover\" # \"Leave a Trace\" # \"Clearest Blue\" # \"Never Say Die\" # \"The Mother We Share === Shows === The performances with short setlists (five songs or fewer) are not included in the list below. ==Tour dates== List of concerts showing date, city, country and venue.
