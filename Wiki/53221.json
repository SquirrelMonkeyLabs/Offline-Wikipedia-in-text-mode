 "text": "This is a list of Members of Parliament (MPs) elected to the House of Commons for the Fifty-Fourth Parliament of the United Kingdom at the 2005 general election, held on 5 May 2005. The list is arranged by constituency. ==List of MPs elected in the general election== The following table is a list of MPs elected on 5 May, 2005, ordered by constituency. The previous MP and previous party column shows the MP and party holding the seat at dissolution on April 11, 2005. Note that most Scottish constituency boundaries were considerably changed from the previous general election, due to a decrease in the number of Scottish seats from 72 to 59. In this case, the previous MPs cannot be shown, and the previous party column shows the notional winner of the new seat, based on analysis of the 2001 general election result. __NOTOC__ Table of contents: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Changes === A === === A === === A === === A === === A === Constituency Elected MP Elected Party Previous MP Previous Party Aberavon Hywel Francis Labour Hywel Francis Labour Aberdeen North Frank Doran Labour (boundary changes) Labour Aberdeen South Anne Begg Labour (boundary changes) Labour Airdrie and Shotts John Reid Labour (boundary changes) Labour Aldershot Gerald Howarth Conservative Gerald Howarth Conservative Aldridge-Brownhills Richard Shepherd Conservative Richard Shepherd Conservative Altrincham and Sale West Graham Brady Conservative Graham Brady Conservative Alyn and Deeside Mark Tami Labour Mark Tami Labour Amber Valley Judy Mallaber Labour Judy Mallaber Labour Angus Michael Weir Scottish National Party (boundary changes) Scottish National Party Argyll and Bute Alan Reid Liberal Democrat (boundary changes) Liberal Democrat Arundel and South Downs Nick Herbert Conservative Howard Flight Conservative Ashfield Geoff Hoon Labour Geoff Hoon Labour Ashford Damian Green Conservative Damian Green Conservative Ashton-under-Lyne David Heyes Labour David Heyes Labour Aylesbury David Lidington Conservative David Lidington Conservative Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock Sandra Osborne Labour (boundary changes) Labour === B === === B === === B === === B === === B === Constituency Elected MP Elected Party Previous MP Previous Party Banbury Tony Baldry Conservative Tony Baldry Conservative Banff and Buchan Alex Salmond Scottish National Party (boundary changes) Scottish National Party Barking Margaret Hodge Labour Margaret Hodge Labour Barnsley Central Eric Illsley Labour Eric Illsley Labour Barnsley East and Mexborough Jeff Ennis Labour Jeff Ennis Labour Barnsley West and Penistone Michael Clapham Labour Michael Clapham Labour Barrow and Furness John Hutton Labour John Hutton Labour Basildon Angela Smith Labour Angela Smith Labour/Co- operative Basingstoke Maria Miller Conservative Andrew Hunter Democratic Unionist (Elected as Conservative) Bassetlaw John Mann Labour John Mann Labour Bath Don Foster Liberal Democrat Don Foster Liberal Democrat Batley and Spen Mike Wood Labour Mike Wood Labour Battersea Martin Linton Labour Martin Linton Labour Beaconsfield Dominic Grieve Conservative Dominic Grieve Conservative Beckenham Jacqui Lait Conservative Jacqui Lait Conservative Bedford Patrick Hall Labour Patrick Hall Labour Belfast East Peter Robinson Democratic Unionist Peter Robinson Democratic Unionist Belfast North Nigel Dodds Democratic Unionist Nigel Dodds Democratic Unionist Belfast South Alasdair McDonnell Social Democratic and Labour The Rev.
