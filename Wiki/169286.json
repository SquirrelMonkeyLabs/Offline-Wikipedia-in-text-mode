 "text": "Nachos are a snack food made with tortilla chips and cheese. Sometimes they have jalapeños, sauce, beans, guacamole or meat on them. Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya created nachos at the Victory Club in 1940 when Mamie Mandwasy, a regular customer, asked if Anaya could bring her and three other women a different snack than usual. Anaya went to the kitchen and spotted freshly fried pieces of corn tortillas. In a moment of culinary inspiration, he added melted cheese and pickled jalapeño strips. After tasting the snack Anaya created, Mandwasy asked what it was called. Anaya responded, \"Well, I guess we can just call them Nacho's Special.\" The dish was so popular, the owner of the Victory Club, Roberto de los Santos, put Nacho's Special on the menu and the snack quickly spread throughout the world. When the Victory Club closed in 1961, Anaya opened his own restaurant, Nacho's. ==References== Category:Snack foods",
