 "text": "The Jazz Loft, founded in 2016, is a museum and music venue in the U.S. state of New York. == History == The Jazz Loft officially opened in 2016 as a non- profit organisation. It now has a board of directors with 12 members. The Jazz Loft functions as a museum, displaying artifacts from the history of jazz, including original recordings, Duke Ellington's pay stubs, and the first Grammy Award given to a jazz musician in 1958. Acoustic in the Main Room is a rare chance to hear some of the most accomplished musicians and vocalists who routinely perform at the Loft in a casual environment, evoking the New York City loft culture of the 1950s that served as the inspiration for the Jazz Loft's title. The Jazz Loft, in partnership with Stony Brook University's (SBU) School of Music, presents performances and an active instructional program. Dr. Thomas Manuel, a jazz historian, cornetist, and music educator, is the endowed Artist in Residence Chair in the Jazz Department at Stony Brook University. == References == Category:Music venues Category:Museums in New York (state) Category:Non-profit organizations of New York (state) Category:2016 establishments in the United States",
