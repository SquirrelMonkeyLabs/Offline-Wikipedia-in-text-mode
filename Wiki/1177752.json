 "text": "Aromobates ericksonae is a frog. It lives in Mérida, Venezuela. ==Body== One adult male frog was 21.7 mm long from nose to rear end. These frogs have short back legs. The skin of the frog's back is dark brown in color. It has a light spot between its eyes. There are two cream-colored stripes on the sides of the body. The stripes go from the nose over the eye to the end of the body. The sides of the body are brown-black in color near the stripes and grayer in color closer to the belly. There is another stripe with yellow spots on each side of the body. The top of the mouth is dark gray in color with white spots. The front legs are gray-brown in color with some cream marks near where they meet the body. The front toes are gray. The back legs are light brown in color with darker marks. ==Name== Scientists named the frog for Ronna Erickson from the University of Massachusetts. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams in forests. Scientists found the frog on the west side of the Cordillera de Mérida. Scientists saw the frog between 676 and 1193 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen some of these frogs in a protected place: Parque Nacional Sierra de La Culata. ==Young== The male frogs sit on the dead leaves on the ground and call to the female frogs. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms and other things that people need. These farms also put bad chemicals into the water. Scientists found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis], which causes chytridiomycosis, on other frogs that live nearby, so they think chytridiomycosis can kill this frog too. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
