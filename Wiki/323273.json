They think the airport runway is too close to the proposed drop zones. In 2005, a ban was placed on skydiving near the airport. In 2008, airport owners said the company Skydive City was using an illegal runway 200 metres from the airport. Skydive City had been forced out of an airport hangar for not paying rent. Airport owners said the illegal runway was dangerous for airport users. ==Other websites== * Runway layout and parking map ==References== Category:Airports in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Victoria, Australia",
