 "text": "A private collection is when someone owns a lot of valuable items, like artwork or other special objects. In places like museums or art galleries, if you see something on display that is not owned by the museum, it was probably given to them for a while by someone else, like a collector or an organization. This could be for a short time or a long time. The person or group giving it could be an art collector, school, church, bank, or another company. People who collect books, even if they do it because they love how the books look, are called bibliophiles, and their collections are usually called libraries. == Other websites == Category:Collecting",
