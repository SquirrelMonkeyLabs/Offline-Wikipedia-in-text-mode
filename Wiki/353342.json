 "text": "\"Pop Ya Collar\" is a song by American singer Usher. It became a lead single from 8701 (2001). The song was leaked on the Internet as part of All About U, an unreleased album by Usher. The song reached number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was more successful in the United Kingdom where it reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song was about an upturned collar. It then became a popular culture \"buzzword\" at the time. The catchphrase (or slang) helped the song to be released by other artists. These include \"Pop Yo Collar\" by MC Hammer (2000) and \"Poppin' My Collar\" by Three 6 Mafia (2006). However, the word originally came from the Bay Area artist E-40. Hammer's version (featuring Wee Wee) helped make \"The Phat Daddy Pop\", \"In Pop Nito\", \"River Pop\", \"Deliver The Pop\" and \"Pop'n It Up\" dance moves. ==Track listing== UK CD # \"Pop Ya Collar\" [Radio Version] 3:34 # \"Pop Ya Collar\" [GForce Jazz Step Vocal Mix] 6:16 # \"My Way\" [Remix With JD] ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2000â€“01) Peak position Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 9 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2001) Position UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 84 ===Certifications=== == References == Category:2001 songs Category:Usher songs",
