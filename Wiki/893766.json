 "text": "Grande-Synthe is a commune in Nord in north France. In 2018, 22,777 people lived there. == Geography == Grande-Synthe is next to Dunkirk, about 6 km west of its center. It is located in a busy and well-connected area of Europe. The city is linked to Lille by the A25 highway, to the Channel Tunnel through Calais, and to Brussels by the A16. Because it is close to the sea, Grande- Synthe has a mild oceanic climate. The city gave up its natural coastline to help build the deep-water port of Dunkirk, which welcomes ships from around the world. Grande-Synthe is in French Flanders, near the Artois hills, and has many ways to travel: free highways, a high-speed train (TGV) station in nearby Dunkirk with a 1.5-hour trip to Paris, access to the Channel Tunnel, waterways, and Franceâ€™s largest rail freight yard. ==Other websites== * INSEE commune file * Official website * Grande-Synthe tourism website (in French, Dutch, and English) Category:Communes in Nord",
