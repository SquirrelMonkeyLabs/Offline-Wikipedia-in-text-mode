 "text": "The Lucas Mansion, also known as the Hiddenite Center, is a historic home. It is in the census-designated place of Hiddenite, North Carolina. It was built around the year 1900. The mansion is a three-story, frame Queen Anne style building. It has a two-story porch. It was made bigger by 1928. Local tradition says the house was made bigger twice by raising the existing floor and building a new floor underneath or between the existing floors. The house roughly follows a cruciform plan, though the plan changes from floor to floor. It was owned by James Paul Lucas. Lucas was a merchant from South Carolina. Lucas Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 1981, Eileen Sharpe and R.Y Sharpe bought the mansion and made the Hiddenite Center. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places",
