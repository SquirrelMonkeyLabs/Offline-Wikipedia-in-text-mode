 "text": "The Jessie Street National Women's Library is a library which has books, music, photographs, and more about women's history in Australia. It is located in the city of Ultimo in New South Wales. It was founded in 1989 so that it would be easier to find books and sources about women, as sources about women's history are harder to find than other types of history. It is named after Jessie Street, an Australian suffragette. People who donated money to start the library, called patrons, are Laurence Street, who is Jessie Street's son, Elizabeth Evatt, Judith Wright, and Oodgeroo Noonuccal. The library has a collection of books, papers, writings, recordings, and more, related to women's organizations, famous Australian women, and more. ==References== Category:Libraries in Australia Category:Women Category:Buildings and structures in New South Wales Category:Organisations based in Australia Category:1989 establishments in Australia",
