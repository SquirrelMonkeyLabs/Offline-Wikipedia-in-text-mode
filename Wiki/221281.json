 "text": "Wurzen is a town on the banks of the river Mulde in north-western Saxony, Germany, about east of the city of Leipzig. One of its claims to fame is the fact that in 1768, the famous German author Goethe traveled through Wurzen and had to wait a long time for the ferry over the Mulde River. While waiting for the boat, he was doing some thinking and later wrote a part of Faust. == References == == Other websites == *Official website Category:Leipzig (district)",
