 "text": "Xenophanes of Colophon, c.570 – c.475 BC,Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy was a Greek philosopher, poet, and social and religious critic. Our knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry, surviving as quotations by later Greek writers. To judge from these, his poetry criticized and satirized a wide range of ideas.Barnes, Jonathan Early Greek philosophy. p40 This included Homer and Hesiod, the belief in the pantheon of anthropomorphic gods and the Greeks' love of athletics and athleticism. He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations, creating \"fame that will reach all of Greece, and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives\".See p123 == Philosophy == Xenophanes' surviving writings display a skepticism that became more commonly expressed during the 4th century BC. He satirized the polytheistic beliefs of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries. \"Homer and Hesiod\" one fragment states, \"have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men: theft, adultery, and mutual deception\". Sextus Empiricus reported that such ideas were savored by Christian apologists.Sextus Empiricus, Against the Mathematicians, I.289, and IX.192f. Xenophanes is quoted, memorably, in Clement of Alexandria,Clement, Miscellanies V.110 and VII.22. arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic: > But if cattle and horses and lions had hands > or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do, > horses like horses and cattle like cattle > also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies > of such a sort as the form they themselves have. > ... > Ethiopians say that their gods are snubnosed and black > Thracians that they are pale and red-haired.Diels-Kranz, Die Fragmente der > Vorsokratiker, Xenophanes frr. 15-16. == Monotheist? == His remark \"God is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind\".Fairbanks, Arthur 1898. The first philosophers of Greece. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, London. #57, p67. led some to claim he was the first monotheist. Others pointed out that he still referred to other gods. == References == Category:Skepticism Category:Ancient Greek philosophers Category:Presocratic philosophers",
