 "text": "A trochophore is a type of larva found in marine plankton. It belongs to several related animal phyla within the superphylum Lophotrochozoa. Trochophores have two or more bands of cilia, which they move rapidly to create water eddies. This allows them to control their movement and direct their food closer to capture it more easily.
