 "text": "Lighting or illumination is the use of light to achieve a certain effect. Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures, as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight. Daylighting (using windows, skylights, or light shelves) is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings. This can save energy in place of using artificial lighting, which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings. Lighting is a major factor in photography, movie making and television studios.A. M. Dhake, TV and Video Engineering (New Delhi: McGraw-Hill, 1995), p. 118 == References == Category:Lighting",
