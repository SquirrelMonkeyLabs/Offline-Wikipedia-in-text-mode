 "text": "The Weinstein Company was an independent movie studio founded in March 2005 by brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein after they left Miramax Films. The studio owned Dimension Films. TWC made melodrama, horror movies and raunchy comedy. Its division Dimension handled the genre movies. After Harvey Weinstein was accused in 2017 of sexually attacking several women in Hollywood, then later convicted and sent to prison for his crimes, many companies, film makers, actors and actresses refused to work with Weinstein or his studio again, and many people in the company itself quit. The Weinstein Company was put up for sale and eventually renamed Lantern Entertainment, which is now considered a separate company. ==References== Category:2002 establishments in the United States Category:American movie studios",
