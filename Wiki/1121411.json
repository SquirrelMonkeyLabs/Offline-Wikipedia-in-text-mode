Scientists have seen it in only one place: Bocas del Toro. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests that are not high in the hills. People have seen this frog between 5 and 145 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water inside hollow plants. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Human beings cut down trees to make farms. Scientists think people might catch this frog to sell as a pet, but they do not know if they do it now. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Bastimentos Island National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
