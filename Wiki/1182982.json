From 1883 to 1892, he taught at the Bruuns Folk School (Bruuns folkehøgskule) in Sel and Gausdal. Skar used folklore themes throughout his adult life to create various works. These works include legends, fairy tales, proverbs, riddles, and nursery rhymes. The following year he received a scholarship from the University of Christiania.
