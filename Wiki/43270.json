 "text": "The Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile is commonly known as Arc de Triomphe (meaning arch of victory). It is a famous monument in Paris. It is at the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle. This was formerly called the Place de l'Étoile at the western end of the Champs-Elysées. Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte commissioned it in 1806 after victory in the Battle of Austerlitz. It was inaugurated on 29 July 1836. It is a large arch, but it is not possible to drive underneath it. Jean-François Chalgrin designed it, and it has roughly 300 steps that lead to the top. It has four main sculptures and six reliefs. Just beneath the vault of the arch, there is the tomb of the unknown soldier. The names of French generals and battles are engraved on the walls. The first stone was laid on August 6th, 1806. It is over 160 feet high and serves as a gate/entryway for the city.
