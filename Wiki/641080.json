 "text": "Harlem Irving Plaza (commonly referred to as \"The HIP\") is an enclosed mall located in Norridge, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The mall features over 100 stores and a food court; anchor stores include Carson's, Kohl's, Best Buy, and Target. It is one of the oldest shopping malls in the Chicago area. Originally a farm, Harlem Irving Plaza opened in 1956 as a strip mall featuring approximately 45 tenants. Between 1975 and 1979, the former strip mall was enclosed, and a parking garage was added. Also in 1979, Madigan's was added to the roster of department stores. In 1988, Kohl's acquired and converted all of the stores in the MainStreet chain; Carson Pirie Scott opened in the former Wieboldt's the same year. A food court was added in 1996, and Best Buy opened in the former Madigan's. Best Buy re-located to the mall's parking lot in 2001; its original location was replaced with a second parking garage. In 2013, the mall underwent another expansion. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Illinois Category:Malls",
