 "text": "Emily Dole (September 28, 1957 â€“ January 2, 2018) was a Samoan-American athlete, actress and professional wrestler who competed in the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling as Mountain Fiji, abbreviated in publications and her official logo as Mt. Fiji. At 350 pounds, she dwarfed all of the other members of the cast, the closest competitor being the glamazon queen Matilda the Hun, who she feuded with for the first two seasons. Wrestling led to other appearances, on the short lived Hard Time on Planet Earth, on the Carol Burnett Show spin-off Mama's Family and in the Pauly Shore romp, Son in Law. Dole was interviewed and featured in the 2012 documentary film GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. Dole died in Orange, California on January 2, 2018 from a long-illness at the age of 60. ==References== ==Other websites== * *Mountain Fiji online biography Category:1957 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American Samoan professional wrestlers Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:Actors from Orange County, California Category:Sportspeople from California Category:American shot putters",
