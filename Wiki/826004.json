Meg wants the family to get her a car. They go to a car dealership to get her one. Meg sees a sedan and wants to get it. However, Peter is tricked into buying a tank. Peter uses the tank for himself. He later teaches Meg how to use it. Joe impounds the tank when he gets hurt by it. Meg gets a job at a superstore so that she can get the money to buy her own car. The superstore makes other shops in the town go bankrupt. Peter loses his job at a brewery because the superstore makes better beer. Their town also gets a big heat wave. The superstore takes all of the energy used for the town's air conditioners. Peter wants to protest, but the superstore's air conditioning makes him feel better. He gets a job at the superstore with Meg. Meg gets a promotion as the assistant manager. She is told to fire Peter. Meg does not want to and stops working for the superstore. Brian and Stewie use Meg's tank to destroy the superstore. When the superstore gets destroyed, Peter gets his job at the brewery back and their air conditioning works again. == Production == \"Hell Comes to Quahog\" was written by Kirker Butler. Dan Povenmire is the director of the episode. Many parts of the episode were not shown on television for being too violent or offensive. One of these parts was a disabled child petting Brian too rough. Brian bites the child. Another part shows a man watching the movie Madagascar while driving a car. The man says \"Dude, those animals are so fucking funny\". The episode was put on a DVD with other episodes from the 5th season on September 18, 2007. Dave Boat, Carrie Fisher, Phil LaMarr, Rachael MacFarlane, Fred Tatasciore, Lori Alan, Alex Breckenridge, Johnny Brennan, Ralph Garman, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener give their voices to many characters in the episode. == Reception == About 9.66 million people watched the episode when it was first broadcast. Dan Iverson of IGN said that the episode has a funny start and a nice ending. He thought that the jokes were very funny and thought that the 5th season would make Family Guy as great as how the show started. Brett Love from TV Squad thought that the episode was better than the 5th season's first two episodes (\"Stewie Loves Lois\" and \"Mother Tucker\"). However, Love thought that the episode was too similar to the South Park episode \"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\". Love did not like how Peter was shown to be \"retarded\" after getting the job at the superstore, saying \"Sometimes it plays really funny, and sometimes it just gets annoying.\" == References == == Other websites == * * Category:Family Guy (season 5) episodes Category:2006 television episodes",
