They contain one hundred and eleven epistles in total. They are organised into six books first collected by one of the greatest Druze sages 'Abd-Allah Al-Tanukhi in 1479 AD. According to oral traditions there were originally twenty-four books. Eighteen are reasonably assumed to have been lost, hidden or destroyed. Epistle number six is dated earliest and was written in July 1017 AD by Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad. He is specifically said as the author of thirty more epistles in the first two books. Epistles 109 and 110 are dated latest, written by Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin in 1042 AD. Epistles 36 to 40 are attributed to Isma'il al-Tamimi ibn Muhammad. The first epistle opens with the goodbye message from Al-Hakim bi- Amr Allah, the original teacher of the Druze. He details his efforts to assist his people's welfare and peace and urges them to remain righteous. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Druze Heritage Foundation * The American Druze Society Category:15th-century books Category:Gnosticism Category:Religious texts Category:Druze",
