 "text": "The iPod shuffle is an MP3 player made by Apple Inc. It's available with a 4GB memory which can hold roughly 1,000 songs, or 2GB memory holding roughly 500 songs. The iPod shuffle is Apple's smallest music player: the newest model is only about one square centimeter in size. It was discontinued on the same day as iPod Nano, on 27 July 2017, around 3 years after iPod Classic, which was discontinued on September 9, 2014 and around 5 years before the iPod Touch, which was discontinued on May 10, 2022. ==Features== ===Battery=== The newest iPod shuffle's battery plays audio for 15 hours when fully charged. This one takes 3 hours to charge fully. ===VoiceOver=== The iPod shuffle is the first music player that talks to the user, using a feature called VoiceOver. When the button on the headphones is held down, VoiceOver will speak the song currently playing and its artist. If a user continues holding it, it will tell the user their playlists. They can click the centre button to select a playlist. This feature is available in 20 languages. ===Colours=== The iPod shuffle is available in pink, blue, green, orange, black and silver. A polished stainless steel edition is available from the online store. The newest iPod shuffle also comes in PRODUCT (RED), where a part of your purchase is donated to a charity that fights the disease called AIDS. ==History== ===First generation=== The first iPod Shuffle was released on January 11, 2005. Steve Jobs said that people were always putting their iPods on shuffle mode and taking them to the gym and using them while they were jogging and that the iPod Shuffle lets people do that in a much more simpler way. The iPod Shuffle relies on a feature from iTunes that lets users select random songs from the iTunes library and copy them onto the Shuffle. It doesn't have a screen and doesn't have most features the other iPods have and instead of having the click wheel, the iPod Shuffle has a more basic wheel with the up and down buttons being for volume, the left and right buttons being for switching between songs and the middle button for playing and pausing. The back has a light that tells the user when the iPod has low battery. ===Second Generation=== The second generation iPod Shuffle was released on September 12, 2006. It's size was changed to be even smaller being the size of a square and Steve Jobs said it was the smallest MP3 player ever. On January 30, 2007 Apple released four new colors blue, green, orange and pink as well as the normal silver color. Blue, green and pink are also the same colors used for the second generation iPod Nano and iPod Mini. On September 5, 2007, Apple replaced the colors blue, green, orange and pink with four new colors turquoise, lavender, mint green, and Product Red. On February 19, 2008, Apple released a 2GB iPod Shuffle for $69. On the same day Apple also lowered the price for the 1GB iPod shuffle from $79 to $49. On September 9, 2008, Apple replaced the colors from September 2007 with colors blue, green, pink and red. They are very similar to the colors from January 2007 except slightly brighter. The 2GB iPod Shuffle was discontinued on March 11, 2009 and the 1GB iPod Shuffle was discontinued on September 9, 2009. ===Third Generation=== On March 11, 2009 Apple released the third generation iPod Shuffle and is said to be \"jaw-droppingly small\" and \"the first iPod that talks to you\" and it is also the first waterproof iPod. The 3G iPod Shuffle was available in black and white. The iPod Shuffle 3G featured VoiceOver technology, a personal assistant that lets the user tell their iPod Shuffle to play a certain album, genre, artist or song. The iPod Shuffle 3rd generation no longer features controls on the device itself, but features controls on the earphones they come with. On September 9, 2009 three new colors pink, blue and green were released and the Apple Store offered a 4GB iPod Shuffle made entirely out of stainless steel. ===Fourth Generation=== The fourth generation iPod Shuffle was released on September 1, 2010. The controls have been put back onto the device and it the design has been reverted to the iPod Shuffle second generation design and it now features VoiceOver in 29 languages: (Chinese (Cantonese, Mandarin), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (Australia, UK, U.S.), Finnish, French (Canada, France), German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish (Mexico, Spain), Swedish, Thai and Turkish). For the first two years the iPod Shuffle was sold in five colors (silver with a black control pad, green, blue, orange and pink with a white control pad) but on September 12, 2012 Apple announced the iPhone 5 and a new iPod Touch and iPod Nano, but seven new colors were announced for the iPod Shuffle (silver or black with a black control pad or green, blue, pink, yellow, and purple with a white control pad) as well as a Product Red edition with a white control pad. ==Models== Generation Image Capacity Colors Connection Original release date Minimum OS to sync Rated battery life (hours) First 512 MB White USB (no adaptor required) January 11, 2005 Mac: 10.2.8 Windows: 2000 audio: 12 First 1 GB White USB (no adaptor required) January 11, 2005 Mac: 10.2.8 Windows: 2000 audio: 12 First New entry-level model.
