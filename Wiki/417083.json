Some help assemble or take apart other macromolecular structures. They do not occur in these structures when the structures go about their normal functions. What they do is: *Fold over half of all mammalian proteins. *Unfold proteins. *Assemble proteins. *Disassemble proteins. The first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and DNA.Ellis R.J. 1996. Discovery of molecular chaperones. Cell stress chaperones 1 (3): 155–60. Those assembly chaperones, especially in the nucleus, assemble folded subunits into larger structures such as cell organelles. One major function of chaperones is to prevent polypeptide chains and subunits sticking together in clumps which do not function. Some chaperones are \"holdases\" which act to stop aggregation. Others, called \"foldases\", do help fold proteins which cannot do it themselves. Such proteins violate Anfinsen's dogma, which said protein folding was automatic. == References == Category:Molecular biology Category:Proteins",
