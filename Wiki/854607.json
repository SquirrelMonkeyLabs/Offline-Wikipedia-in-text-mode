 "text": "The Imbabura tree frog (Boana picturata) is a frog that lives in Colombia and Ecuador, on the west side of these countries. Scientists have seen them between 50 and 500 meters above sea level. One adult female frog was 59 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog is very colorful. It has a round tongue that does not stick out much. It has eardrums that are easy to see. There are many of these frogs alive now, but they are becoming fewer and fewer. Scientists think this is because human beings are changing the forests where the frogs live into farms, cities, and places to graze animals. They also think the frogs are dying because of chemicals farmers use to kill insects. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
