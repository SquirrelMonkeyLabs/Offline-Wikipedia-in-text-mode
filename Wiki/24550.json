 "text": "Jackals are canid species found in Africa, Asia and Europe.\"Jackal\" is a common name, and does not take an initial capital except when starting a sentence. They are carnivorous of small and medium-sized prey. To hunt, they can run at speeds of 16 km/h (10 mph). This is not fast, but they have great endurance, so can run for a long time. ~~They often chase prey as a pair or a group, usually not as individuals.~~ Jackals are \"opportunistic omnivores\", which will take on larger animals if they need to. They are predators of small to medium-sized animals and scavengers. Jackals are monogamous (each male lives with only one female). A pair defends its territory from other pairs: they mark the territory with urine and feces. The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults who live with their parents until they have their own territory. ~~Sometimes, jackals join small packs, for example to hunt a big animal, but normally they hunt alone or as a pair.~~ Jackals are not a clade. They have several times developed from canid ancestors. However, they are closely related. It could be put this way: jackals are dogs which have a certain similar appearance and behaviour. They all have 78 chromosomes.Wayne R. 1993. Molecular evolution of the dog family. Trends in Genetics. 9 (6): 218â€“24. doi:10.1016/0168-9525(93)90122-X. PMID 8337763 There are three species of jackals: *Black-backed jackal (Lupulella mesomelas) - the common jackal, live in many African habitats; *Golden jackal (Canis aureus) - live in South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe; *Side-striped jackal (Lupulella adusta) - live in central and Southern Africa; A canid from Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), is sometimes called Simien jackal, but it is really a wolf. The Ethiopian wolf is one of the rarest and most endangered of all canids. == References == Category:Canids",
