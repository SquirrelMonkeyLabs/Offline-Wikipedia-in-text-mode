 "text": "Chancellor is the head of the government in some European countries including Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The title \"Chancellor\" means the same thing as \"Prime Minister\". For example, Italy has a Prime Minister while Germany has a Chancellor but they have roughly the same job. In the United Kingdom, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the person in charge of the country's finances (taxes and spending). Also in the United Kingdom, there is a Lord Chancellor. Chancellor is also a title given to public officials in some other countries. For example, Daijō-daijin or Chancellor of the Realm was a government position in Japan in the late Nara and Heian periods.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric.
