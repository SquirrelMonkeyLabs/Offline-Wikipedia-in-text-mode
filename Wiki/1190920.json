 "text": "Cobbler is a dessert consisting of a fruit (or less commonly savory) filling poured into a large baking dish and covered with a batter, biscuit, or dumpling (in the United Kingdom) before being baked. Cobbler is part of the cuisine of the United Kingdom and United States, and is similar to a crumble or a crisp. However, traditional cobbler differs from both of these by the presence of a leavening agent such as baking powder or baking soda. Cobblers made in this way can be viewed as a hybrid of pie and cake. Some cobbler recipes, especially in the American South, resemble a thick-crusted, deep-dish pie with both a top and bottom crust that lack leavening and are less cake- like. ==Related pages== *Coffee milk *Hot wiener *Beignet *Boston cream pie *Lobster roll *Clam chowder *Sili ice cream Category:Desserts",
