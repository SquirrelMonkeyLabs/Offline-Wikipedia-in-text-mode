 "text": "Human sexual behavior refers to all the ways in which humans experience and live their sexuality. It includes acts done alone, for example masturbation, and acts done with a partner. Not all acts done with a partner are about sexual intercourse. All these acts usually result in sexual arousal. Human sexual activity can also include things done to find new partners, or to attract their attention (for example courtship). ==Types of human sexual activity== Sexual activity has many different forms. Commonly, sexual activity involves foreplay, which is the act of making the partner feel good. Sexual activity can involve one or more people. Sexual activity may be different depending on the gender and sexual orientation of the people involved. Some forms of sexual activity only involve one person, which is called autoeroticism. A person who does autoeroticism typically engages in sexual fantasy or masturbation. If two or more people are involved, they will do sexual activity with each other. Two partners can do vaginal sex, anal sex, or oral sex. Alternatively, they may do mutual masturbation, which is the act of masturbating each other. Penetrative sex between two people may be described as sexual intercourse. If there are more than two people in a sex act, it may be referred to as group sex. People can use sex toys to make their sexual activity more enjoyable. Examples include dildos, vibrators, and butt plugs. Sex toys are usually used alone, but they can be used with partners too. Some people have fetishes. This is a type of human sexual activity that involves body parts or objects that are not normally regarded as sexual. Fetishes of body parts (partialism) include the breasts, navel, and feet. Some people have fetishes for objects, such as shoes, clothing, lingerie, leather, and rubber. Some people with fetishes have a sexual interest in certain actions, such as choking. However, some fetishes can be dangerous, some of which may cause injury. In order to have good human sexual activity, both partners must agree to do sexual activity, and they must be at least a certain age. This is called consent. If sexual activity is forced or threatened, it is considered rape or another form of sexual assault. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal depending on the person's age, gender, status of marriage, or other reasons related to the participants of sexual activity. Some countries don't have laws against certain types of sexual activity, even if the sexual activity does not agree with social norms or generally accepted sexual morals. ==Related pages== *Pornography ==References== Category:Human sexuality",
