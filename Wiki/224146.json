 "text": "Chinglish is a word for English that is influenced by Chinese. It often uses Chinese grammar and vocabulary that has been translated into English. For example, \"long time no see (we have not met for a long time)\" is translated from Chinese 好久不見 \"hǎojiǔbùjiàn\". The term Chinglish comes from a combination of the words Chinese and English. == Example == One car come, one car go, two car pengpeng, one car die. === Proper english translation === One car drove towards another; both cars crashed, and one of them was destroyed. == References == Category:English language Category:Chinese language",
