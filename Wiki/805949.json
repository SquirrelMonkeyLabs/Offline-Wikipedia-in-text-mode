 "text": "Ricardo Alonso \"Pancho\" González (May 9, 1928 – July 3, 1995), known sometimes as Richard Gonzales, was an American tennis player. He won 14 major singles titles (12 Pro Slam events, 2 Grand Slam events). Gonzales was the world's leading professional player at a time when almost all players were amateur. His peak was from about 1952 to about 1958. He won many professional and open titles. He was always a serve-and-volley player at a time when many amateurs played a baseline game. When he first turned professional, the reigning top man was Jack Kramer. At first, Kramer crushed him. Gonzales semi-retired in 1950/51. When he came back in late 1951, Gonzales was much improved. He reached the top in 1952, winning the professional hard-court title in Los Angeles. The Tennis Hall of Fame says Gonzales rose to the rank of number one in 1952. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in Nevada Category:Deaths from stomach cancer Category:American tennis players Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles",
