 "text": "The Abraham's Well International Visitors Center is an archaeological museum and convention center in Beer Sheva, Israel. It was opened in 2013 on the site of Abraham's Well. The center is near the Old city of Beer Sheva and Nahal Beer Sheva on the road to Eilat. The well was discovered in the 19th century by Edward Robinson and Henry Baker Tristram. In 1897, a Beduin sheikh built an Arabian structure above the well to take over the place. In the Ottoman Period, a Bustan was grown next to the well. According to the Jewish Bible, in the place of the well Abraham signed a peace agreement with Abimelech, the king of the Philistines. == Gallery == file:View of Beer-Sheva 2014 02.JPG| file:BEER ABRAAM.jpg| == Other websites == https://www.facebook.com/pg/AbrahamswellBR7/about/?ref=page_internal (May appear in Hebrew only) *Abrahams Well International Visitors Center (Dead link as of 06 May, 2019) Category:Beer Sheba Category:Archaeological sites in Israel Category:2013 establishments in Asia Category:Museums in Israel Category:2010s establishments in Israel",
