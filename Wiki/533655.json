 "text": "Title IX (pronounced \"title nine\") is a portion of the United States Education Amendments of 1972. It was co-authored and introduced by Senator Birch Bayh after the wave of feminist activism led by Bernice Sandler. It was renamed the Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act in 2002, after its late House co-author and sponsor. Title IX is a federal law that makes it illegal to discriminate against a person on the basis of sex in any federally funded activity. But even after Title IX was passed by Congress, women's athletic and academic opportunities in American schools still did not equal men's programs. == References == Category:Athletics Category:United States law",
