 "text": "The WAGR Z class were a total of 3 small diesel-mechanical locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1953 to 1983. The Z class were ordered from the Drewry Car Coy who subcontracted the order to Robert Stephenson & Hawthorn Ltd (RSH) of Newcastle, England. Upon arrival in Western Australia, the Z class were allocated to shunt the jetties at Bunbury and Busselton along with other Southern ports. In 1983 the Z class were all withdrawn, with all being preserved as No. 1151 went to Steamtown, Peterborough in South Australia, and No. 1153 went to the Boulder Loopline Railway where it is presently stored as the line is permanently closed. No. 1152 is operational and being used on works trains on the Hotham Valley Railway and is the assigned shunter at Pinjarra; No. 1152 was also loaned to Downer EDI Works Ltd to aid in the construction of a rail depot at Nowergup, featured as part of the extension of the Northern Suburbs Railway. ==Gallery== File:Z1151.jpg|Z1151 at rest in a siding File:Z1151, Steamtown, 2017 (01).jpg|Z1151 preserved at Steamtown in a non-authentic livery, circa 2017 File:WAGRZ1151Walloway.jpg|Z1151 with a small train in Walloway, South Australia, circa 1996 Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
