 "text": "\"All My Loving\" is a song by The Beatles, written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney), from the 1963 album With the Beatles. ==Writing== According to journalist Bill Harry, McCartney wrote the lyrics while shaving, but McCartney told biographer Barry Miles that he wrote them while on a tour bus. He also said, \"It was the first song I'd ever written the words first. I never wrote words first, it was always some kind of accompaniment. I've hardly ever done it since either.\" The lyrics follow the \"letter song\" model as used on \"P.S. I Love You\", the B-side of their first single. Lennon showed his love for the song in his 1980 Playboy interview: ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney – double-tracked vocal, bass *John Lennon – backing vocal, rhythm guitar *George Harrison – backing vocal, lead guitar *Ringo Starr – drums *George Martin – producer *Norman Smith – engineer :Personnel per Ian MacDonald ==Notes== ==Other websites== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:The Beatles songs Category:1963 songs",
