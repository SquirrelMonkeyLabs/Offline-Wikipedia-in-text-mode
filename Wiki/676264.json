 "text": "The Arawak were a group of people who lived in the northern part of South America, and the Caribbean. After the colonization of South America, they became extinct, within a period of about a century, to a century and a half. Today, only very few people who call themselves Arawak remain. There's also a group of languages called the Arawakian languages, which show what influence these people probably once had. Today, there are about 2000 speakers left, 1500 in Guyana, and 700 in Suriname. In the year 1515, there were about 50.000 Native American allies (to the Spanish) on Haitit, from an original estimate of 250.000. In 1550, there were about 500 people. 1650, there were none left.
