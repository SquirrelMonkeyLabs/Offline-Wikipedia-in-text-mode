 "text": "Togo was a sled dog owned by Leonhard Seppala. He was Seppala’s lead dog in the 1925 serum run to Nome. His team ran the longest and most dangerous part. Togo’s half brother Fritz was also part of the team. Balto, another dog who took part, became the most famous because he was part of the final team. Many believe that Togo should have received the attention that the press gave to Balto. ==References== Category:Individual dogs Category:1929 deaths Category:1913 births Category:History of Alaska",
