 "text": "Jaffa Cakes are a small kind of sweet snack that are named after the Jaffa orange. They are made with orange-flavored jam, and chocolate. McVitie and Price introduced them in the United Kingdom in 1927. Even though they look like biscuits, a court ruled that they are cakes. The court case was because biscuits are taxed differently than cakes. In the United Kingdom cakes are treated as a staple food so value-added tax is not charged. Biscuits are taxed because they are treated as a luxury. McVitie's did not register the name \"Jaffa Cakes\" as a trademark. For this reason, other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name. The product's classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991. The court found in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes. In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the United Kingdom.\"Jaffa Cakes - definitely not biscuits - prepare to take on imitators\" . The Daily Telegraph.
