 "text": "On 22 March 2021, a fire started during late afternoon in the Balukhali refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. It destroyed a large part of the camp, killed over a dozen people, and left nearly a thousand injured or missing. The fire forced roughly 50,000 Rohingya refugees out of their camps and destroyed many buildings, including schools and food storage centres. First responders to the crisis were refugees from the camp itself. ==References== Category:2021 fires in Asia Category:2021 in Bangladesh Category:March 2021 events",
