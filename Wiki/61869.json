 "text": "The Brahmaputra ( son of brahma ), also called Tsangpo in Tibet, is one of the main rivers in Asia. It has its origin in the Himalayas of Tibet. It flows through Tibet, India and Bangladesh. It is long. Massive flooding occurs when the ice melts in the Spring. The Brahmaputraâ€™s source is the Chemayungdung Glacier, which covers the slopes of the Himalayas. It joins with the Ganges river and empties into the Bay of Bengal and also forms the Gangetic delta, which is the largest delta in India. ==References== ==Other websites== *http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/rivers/brahmaputra.html - Brahmaputra River Map Category:Rivers of Bangladesh Category:Rivers of China Category:Geography of Tibet Category:Rivers of Assam Category:Rivers of India Category:Bay of Bengal",
