 "text": "Amory Bloch Lovins is Chairman and Chief Scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute. For four decades he has worked in energy policy and related areas. Lovins worked professionally as an environmentalist in the 1970s and since then as an analyst of a \"soft energy path\" for the United States and other nations. He has promoted energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, and the generation of energy at or near the site where the energy is actually used. Lovins has also promoted a \"negawatt revolution\" arguing that utility customers do not want kilowatt-hours of electricity; they want energy services. In the 1990s, his work with Rocky Mountain Institute included the design of an ultra-efficient automobile, the Hypercar. Lovins has received ten honorary doctorates and won many awards. He has provided expert testimony in eight countries, briefed 19 heads of state, and published 29 books. These books include Winning the Oil Endgame, Small is Profitable, Factor Four, and Natural Capitalism. In 2009, Time magazine named Lovins as one of the world's 100 most influential people. ==Related pages== *Christopher Flavin *Energy conservation *Renewable energy commercialization *Joseph Romm *Mycle Schneider *World Nuclear Industry Status Report ==Other websites== * The Rocky Mountain Institute's home page * 20 Hydrogen myths - published by the Rocky Mountain Institute * The Nuclear Illusion * Lectures series on energy efficiency , March 2007 * The Volvo Environment Prize is awarded to Amory B.
