 "text": "\"Shadilay\" is an Italo disco song by P.E.P.E. that was published in 1986 by Magic Sound. It was written by Italian singer-songwriter Marco Ceramicola, who was known professionally as Manuele Pepe. It became popular in 2016 because its name was similar to that of Pepe the Frog and the single's label also featured a cartoon frog. Magic Sound has used this drawing for other songs they have produced, such as \"Babababo\" by Bibox. It is also used as the anthem for the fictional country of Kekistan. Ceramicola had stopped making music by then, and found the song's online success to be unexpected. ==Composition== \"Shadilay\" is an electronic Italo disco song. The song's verses are in A minor, while its chorus is in C major. It plays at 103 beats per minute. The song was played using a DX7 keyboard. ==Track listing== ;12\" Single (Magic Sound – MASNP 007) # \"Shadilay\" (Vocal) – 6:06 # \"Shadilay\" (Instrumental) – 6:05 ==Personnel== * Written by Marco Ceramicola * Lead vocals by Manuele Pepe * Arranged by Massimo Marcolini ==Notes== ==References== Category:1986 songs Category:Internet memes",
