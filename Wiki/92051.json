 "text": "The Milwaukee Brewers are a Major League Baseball team in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They play in the Central Division of the National League. The team first played in Seattle, Washington, for one season (1969). They were called the Seattle Pilots. In 1970, they moved to Milwaukee and were renamed the Milwaukee Brewers. The team is named \"Brewers\" because the city of Milwaukee is famous for making beer. The old minor league baseball team in Milwaukee had also been called the Brewers. The team played in the American League from 1969 to 1997, and they won the American League championship in 1982. They started playing in the National League in 1998. The name of the stadium where they play baseball is American Family Field, which was built in 2001 and was known as Miller Park until 2021. Before American Family Field was built, the team played in Milwaukee County Stadium, which was next to the place where American Family Field was built.
