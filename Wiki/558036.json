The United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.NASA Apollo 11 40th anniversary. There have been six missions with people onboard that landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. There were also numerous landings without people onboard, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.
