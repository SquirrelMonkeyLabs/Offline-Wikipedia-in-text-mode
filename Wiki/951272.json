 "text": "The Treaty of Fort Harmar (1789) was a treaty between Native Americans and the United States. This treaty was about the issue of land in the Northwest Territory. Wyandot, Delaware, Ottawa, Chippewa, Potawatomi and Sauk Natives met with Governor Saint Clair. The treaty had the same conditions and land boundary as the Treaty of Fort McIntosh (1785). Many Natives did not respect the treaty. The treaty did not reduce conflict between Natives and Americans. The Shawnee did not follow the treaty.Laurence M.
