 "text": "Shakir Ali (1916 â€“ 1975) was a famous modern Pakistani artist and art teacher. He was the principal of the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan, from 1962 onwards for a long time and did much to develop and modernise this institution. He had a huge following of students, many of whom also later became well-known artists in Pakistan. ==Museum== Before he died, Shakir Ali donated many of his own paintings and artworks to a private, non-profit trust for a museum to be established. The Shakir Ali Museum was established by the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) after Shakir Ali died in 1975. The PNCA decided on a plan of buying the house of teacher and painter Shakir Ali, and of converting into a museum. The museum is in Lahore. It is a fine museum with a good art collection and is a very useful learning site for art students and teachers. PNCA is in charge of the museums exhibitions and programs and the day-to-day management. Some of his other paintings can also be seen at the Lahore Museum. ==Other websites== *Posthumous tribute to Ten Great Painters by Pakistan Post Category:1916 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Pakistani educators Category:Pakistani painters Category:Artists from Lahore",
