 "text": "Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the Americas, and the highest outside Asia. The altitude is 6,962 meters, or 22,841 feet. It is one of the Seven Summits. It is in the Argentine province of Mendoza. It is in Aconcagua Provincial Park, in the Andes,. Aconcagua is considered to have the highest mortality rate of any high mountain in South America (approximately three deaths per year). This is because it is relatively easy to climb, so people try to do it without proper preparation. Climbers blanch at altitude sickness and extreme weather changes, with strong winds as a result of the mountain's proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Since records began in 1926, more than one hundred people have died on Aconcagua. Between 2001 and 2012, of the 42,731 people who tried to reach the summit, 33 died, which indicates a mortality rate of 0.77 per 1,000 individuals. == References == Category:Andes Category:Mountains of Argentina Category:Mendoza Province",
