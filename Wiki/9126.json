In 1938, they left Germany for London, shortly after Adolf Hitler became Germany's leader. Sachs is best known for his role as Manuel on Fawlty Towers. He also played Albert Einstein in a 1996 episode of Nova on PBS, and provided all the voices in the English version of the 1994 movie version of Faust. He was involved in a controversy when Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross left obscene phone messages on his answerphone stating that Brand had had sex with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie, a member of the Satanic Sluts. Sachs died on 23 November 2016 at a nursing home in Northwood, London from vascular dementia, aged 86. == References == == Other websites == *Andrew Sachs at the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) Category:1930 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Actors from Berlin Category:Actors from London Category:British movie actors Category:British television actors Category:British voice actors Category:Deaths from vascular dementia Category:Disease-related deaths in London Category:German Jews Category:Jewish British actors Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom",
