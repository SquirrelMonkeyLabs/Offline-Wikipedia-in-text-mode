Trump and people who represent him were accused of paying Daniels $130,000 so that she wouldn't tell anyone about an alleged sexual relationship with Trump. Spokespeople for Trump said that he never had an affair. White House Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke for Trump. She said he never gave any payments to Daniels. In 2010, a group of fans tried to get Daniels to run against Republican Senator David Vitter.
