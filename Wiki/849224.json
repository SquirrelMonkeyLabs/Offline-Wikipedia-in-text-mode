 "text": "Shehzad Tanweer (15 December 1982 â€“ 7 July 2005) was one of four Al Qaeda terrorists who exploded bombs in three trains on the London Underground and one bus in central London during the 7 July 2005 London bombings. 56 people were killed and over 700 hurt in the attacks. Tanweer was named by Scotland Yard as the man who exploded a bomb while travelling towards the east on the Circle Line between Liverpool Street and Aldgate, killing both himself and seven of the 56 killed in total in the attacks. The other three men were found out to be Hasib Hussain, Germaine Lindsay, and Mohammad Sidique Khan. They all died in the explosions they set off. == Video statement == On 6 July 2006, a video statement by Tanweer was published by Al-Jazeera. In the video, which included statements by al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, Tanweer said: \"What have you witnessed now is only the beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you pull your forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And until you stop your financial and military support to America and Israel.\" Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which \"continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya\" Tanweer's statements was clearer in making this link with British foreign policy than Mohammad Sidique Khan, the person thought to be the lead bomber. The video has also served to confirm thoughts that both Khan and Tanweer had contact with Ayman Al-Zawahiri and other senior figures in the Al-Qaeda organisation while in Dubai. ==London bombing== A few days before the bombing, Tanweer rented a red Nissan Micra from a local car-rental agency. His hair was also bleached due to the hydrogen peroxide he was using prior to the attack. On 7 July, Tanweer, Khan, Hussain, and Lindsay are believed to have picked up the bombs from a house in the Leeds, hiding them in their rucksacks, then to have driven to Luton, Bedfordshire in the red Nissan, which he left parked in Luton railway station car park. In Luton, the men went on the 07:23 Thameslink train, arriving at King's Cross in London at around 08.20 hours, where they went different ways and exploded their bombs. The three London underground bombs exploded within 60 seconds of each other at 8:50 a.m.Tanweer travelled towards the east on the Circle line from Kings Cross, exploding his bomb on train number 204 between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations, also killing at least seven people. The police found his body parts in the carriage he blew up. After the bombings, police found other bombs in Tanweer's car, which would be dealt with by an explosive police team. == References == Category:1982 births Category:2005 deaths Category:British Muslims Category:Suicide bombers Category:English murderers Category:People from Leeds Category:July 2005 London bombings",
