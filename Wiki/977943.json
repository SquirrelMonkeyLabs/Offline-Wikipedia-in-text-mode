Spanish original IPA transcription English translation [o ˈɡloɾja immaɾseˈsible] [o ˈxubilo immoɾˈtal] [en ˈsuɾkos de doˈloɾes] 𝄆 [el ˈbjen xeɾˈmina ˈʝa] 𝄇 [o ˈɡloɾja immaɾseˈsible] [o ˈxubilo immoɾˈtal] [en ˈsuɾkos de doˈloɾes] [el ˈbjen xeɾˈmina ˈʝa] 1 [seˈso la oˈrible ˈnot͡ʃe] [la libeɾˈtad suˈblime] [deˈrama las auˈɾoɾas] [de su imbenˈsible ˈlus] [la umaniˈdad enˈteɾa] [ke ˈentɾe kaˈdenas ˈxime] [komˈpɾende las paˈlabɾas] [del ke muˈɾjo en la ˈkɾus] Oh, unwithering glory! Oh, immortal jubilance! In furrows of pain, 𝄆 goodness now germinates. 𝄇 Oh, unwithering glory! Oh, immortal jubilance! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates. I The horrible night has ceased. Sublime Liberty spills the auroras of her invincible light. The entirety of humanity that groans within chains, comprehend the words of He who died on the cross. II \"Independence!\" shouts the American world; The land of Columbus. Is bathed in heroes' blood. But this great doctrine; \"The king is not sovereign\", resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. III The bed of the Orinoco Is heaped with plunder, Of blood and tears a river is seen to flow there. In Bárbula know neither souls nor eyes, whether admiration to feel or fear to suffer. IV On the shores of the Caribbean, a famished people fight, preferring horror to fickle health. O, aye! from Cartagena heavy is the hardship, and death's rubble disdains her virtue V From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, from every sprig a hero was crowned undefeated. Soldiers without armor won the victory; their virile spirit served them as a shield. VI Bolívar crosses the Andes bathed by two oceans, swords as though sparks flash in Junín. Indomitable centaurs descend to the plains, and a premonition begins to be felt, of the epic's end. VII The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho loudly thunders, as in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is first felt, from the American sky forming a pavilion. VIII In agony, the Virgin Tears out her hair, and bereft of her love, leaves it to hang on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. IX Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes bursting forth; a constellation of cyclops the night did brighten. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. X But it's not complete glory to defeat in battle, the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. For independence alone The great clamour doesn't silence; if the sun shines on everyone, justice is liberty. XI Of men the rights Nariño's preaching, the soul of struggle was prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, \"Duty before life,\" with flames he wrote. ===In local languages=== Wayuu translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?si=gaR5P-Mspjnnz0sM&v;=ayv2ntdt8Yg&feature;=youtu.be ==References== Category:National symbols of Colombia Col",
