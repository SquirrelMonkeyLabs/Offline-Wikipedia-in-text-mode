Spanish original IPA transcription English translation [o 틛토lo쬵a imma쬽e틛sible] [o 틛xubilo immo쮊값al] [en 틛su쬶os de do틛lo쬰s] 洧 [el 틛bjen xe쮊갌ina 틛퉇a] 洧 [o 틛토lo쬵a imma쬽e틛sible] [o 틛xubilo immo쮊값al] [en 틛su쬶os de do틛lo쬰s] [el 틛bjen xe쮊갌ina 틛퉇a] 1 [se틛so la o틛rible 틛not포툮e] [la libe쮊값ad su틛blime] [de틛rama las au틛쬺쬬s] [de su imben틛sible 틛lus] [la umani틛dad en틛te쬬] [ke 틛ent쬰 ka틛denas 틛xime] [kom틛p쬰nde las pa틛lab쬬s] [del ke mu틛쬵o en la 틛k쬿s] Oh, unwithering glory! Oh, immortal jubilance! In furrows of pain, 洧 goodness now germinates. 洧 Oh, unwithering glory! Oh, immortal jubilance! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates. I The horrible night has ceased. Sublime Liberty spills the auroras of her invincible light. The entirety of humanity that groans within chains, comprehend the words of He who died on the cross. II \"Independence!\" shouts the American world; The land of Columbus. Is bathed in heroes' blood. But this great doctrine; \"The king is not sovereign\", resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. III The bed of the Orinoco Is heaped with plunder, Of blood and tears a river is seen to flow there. In B치rbula know neither souls nor eyes, whether admiration to feel or fear to suffer. IV On the shores of the Caribbean, a famished people fight, preferring horror to fickle health. O, aye! from Cartagena heavy is the hardship, and death's rubble disdains her virtue V From Boyac치 in the fields, the genius of glory, from every sprig a hero was crowned undefeated. Soldiers without armor won the victory; their virile spirit served them as a shield. VI Bol칤var crosses the Andes bathed by two oceans, swords as though sparks flash in Jun칤n. Indomitable centaurs descend to the plains, and a premonition begins to be felt, of the epic's end. VII The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho loudly thunders, as in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is first felt, from the American sky forming a pavilion. VIII In agony, the Virgin Tears out her hair, and bereft of her love, leaves it to hang on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. IX Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes bursting forth; a constellation of cyclops the night did brighten. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. X But it's not complete glory to defeat in battle, the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. For independence alone The great clamour doesn't silence; if the sun shines on everyone, justice is liberty. XI Of men the rights Nari침o's preaching, the soul of struggle was prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, \"Duty before life,\" with flames he wrote. ===In local languages=== Wayuu translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?si=gaR5P-Mspjnnz0sM&v;=ayv2ntdt8Yg&feature;=youtu.be ==References== Category:National symbols of Colombia Col",
