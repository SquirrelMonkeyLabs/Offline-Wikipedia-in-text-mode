 "text": "Toilet seats let the user sit on a toilet by covering the bowl. Household toilet seats consist of a seat, cover and hinges. The place where you sit is called the seat. There is a hole in the middle of the seat so that you can defecate or urinate. Many toilet seats have a lid which keeps objects from falling into the bowl. Two metal hinges attach the seat to the toilet. Common materials for the seat's body include plastic, wood and a special kind of ceramic called porcelain. Some homemakers prefer seats that are upholstered. There are two types of toilet seat fixings: Bottom Fixings and Top Fixings. This can means that the seat is covered in fabric. The majority of modern toilets now come with top fixing seat installation as they are easier to fit and remove for cleaning. == References == Category:Hygiene Category:Toilets",
