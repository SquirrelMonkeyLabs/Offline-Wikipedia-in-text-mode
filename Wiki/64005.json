The American Girl series was first created by The Pleasant Company in 1986, founded by Pleasant T. Rowland. Today, the dolls and books are made by Mattel, a large toy company. Each doll has her own line of accessories that includes a series of books about her life, furniture, clothing, pets, and things that she would use or play with. For some dolls, a doll of her best friend is included in the collection. Four of the dolls have had movies made about their stories. ==Current Historical Dolls== *Kaya (1760s) *Josefina (1820s) *Addy (1860s) *Samantha (BeForever) (1900s) *Rebecca (1910s) * Claudie (1920s) * Kit (1930s) * Nanea (1940s) * Molly (1940s) * Maryellen (1950s) * Melody (1960s) *Julie (1970s) *Courtney (1980s) =='Retired' dolls== There have also been some dolls who have been \"retired\": *Felicity & Elizabeth (1770s) *Caroline (1810s) *CÃ©cile & Marie-Grace (1850s) *Kirsten (1850s) *Samantha & Nellie (1900s), however Samantha was re-released in 2014 as part of American Girl's BeForever Collection. *Kit's best friend, Ruthie (1930s) * Molly & Emily (1940s), however Molly was re-released in 2022. * Julie's best friend, Ivy (1970s) ==Girl of the Year== There is also another line of dolls called \"Girl of the Year,\" (called \"American Girl of Today\" before 2006).
