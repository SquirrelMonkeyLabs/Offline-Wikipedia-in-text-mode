 "text": "The Ford Bronco was a utility vehicle that was produced from 1966 to 1996. It had five distinct generations. All these vehicles are currently classified as sport utility vehicles (SUV). The Broncos can be divided into two categories: early Broncos (1966–77) and full-size Broncos (1978–96). In 2021, after 25 years away, Ford revived the Bronco name on a new small, retro-styled SUV. The Bronco was introduced in 1966. It was a competitor to the small four-wheel drive compact SUVs that included the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout. It was built on its own platform. Ford positioned the Bronco between the Jeep and Scout.Steve Statham, Jeep Color History (Osceola, WI: MBI Publishing Co., 1999), p. 95 But it was too small to capture the US market.Car: The Definitive Visual History of the Automobile (London: DK Publishing, 2011), p. 218 A major redesign in 1978 moved the Bronco to a larger size. It used a shortened Ford F-Series truck chassis to compete with both the similarly adapted Chevrolet K5 Blazer, as well as the Dodge Ramcharger. The full-size Broncos and the successor Expedition were produced at Ford's Michigan Truck Plant in Wayne, Michigan. == References == Category:Ford automobiles Category:Sport utility vehicles",
