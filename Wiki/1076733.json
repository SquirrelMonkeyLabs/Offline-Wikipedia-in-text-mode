It happened after the crew of a train ignored a stop signal and ended up falling through an open bridge. In the disaster, 99 people are believed to have died and 100 injured. The St-Hilaire train disaster remains the deadliest rail disaster in Canadian history. During an investigation into the incident, the engineer William Burnie and the conductor Thomas Finn had ignored a stop signal and proceeded to cross the bridge anyway despite the country's safety laws. The train went through the open bridge and aink 10 feet into the river below. Burnie escaped, but 99 others died, including Finn. On July 16, 1864, Burnie was convicted of negligence, and a jury sentenced him to 10 years in prison. Full responsibility was placed on the Grand Trunk Railway by a grand jury on October 5, 1864.
