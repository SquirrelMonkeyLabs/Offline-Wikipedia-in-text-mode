 "text": "A radiometer or roentgenometer is a device for measuring the radiant flux (power) of electromagnetic radiation. Generally, a radiometer is an infrared radiation detector or ultraviolet detector. == Types == * The name Radiometer is frequently used to refer to a Crookes radiometer (\"light-mill\"). This is an early device wherein a rotor in a partial vacuum spins when exposed to light. * The Nichols radiometer is a newer and more sensitive radiometer than the Crookes type. It measures radiation pressure. It has two small mirrors suspended on a quartz fiber. * A microwave radiometer operates in the microwave wavelengths. The radiometer contains argon gas to enable it to rotate. * The MEMS radiometer can operate on the same principles of Nichols or Crooke radiometers. It can operate over a wide spectrum of wavelength and particle energy levels. MEMS Radiometer United States Patent 7,495,199 == References == Category:Electromagnetic radiation",
