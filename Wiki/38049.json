 "text": "A television program (British spelling: programme) or television show or television series, is something that people watch on television. Several different kinds are made: * A series of fictional programs with the same title and characters (a television series). Each television series is made as a series of programs. These individual programs are called episodes. Most series have between 12 and 24 episodes in each season. Some with fewer are called miniseries. * A single show (episode) from a television series. * An ongoing series of non-fiction shows that use the same title, for example: local and network news shows. * A single program, for example a sporting event or an awards ceremony such as the Academy Awards. Television broadcasting presents many different television programs, one after another. In between television programs, a channel may use an announcer to tell the audience what the next program will be. On many channels in many countries, advertisements are shown for short periods of time during and between program screenings. These advertisements are not a part of the television program. ==Other websites== == References ==",
