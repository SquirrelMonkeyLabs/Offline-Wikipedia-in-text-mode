 "text": "Kleomedes of Astypalia was an Ancient Greek boxer, who had a successful boxing career all throughout the 5th century BC. However, in either the 71st or 72nd Olympic Games (496 or 492 BCE), using an illegal strike, he killed his opponent Ikos. Because of this offense, and not due to the murder of his opponent, which was not considered a punishable act, he was disqualified and heavily fined by the judges. Kleomedes mourned his loss greatly, because it put a stain on his record, consequently, while returning to his home town Astypalia, in a flash of Mania, he pulled out the pillar supporting a school roof, purportedly killing at least 27 children. The people attempted to stoned him to death, but he fled into a temple and climbed into a holy chest. When the people opened it, he was gone. His confused persuers consulted the Oracle of Delphi, which told the people that Kleomedes had become a hero. From that moment onwards he was commemorated with annual sacrifices in his honour. His mythos is interpreted to comment on the nature of Rules. == Pausanias, 6.9.6-9 Description of Greece == Translation 1 > [6] At the Festival previous to this it is said that Cleomedes of Astypalaea > killed Iccus of Epidaurus during a boxing-match. On being convicted by the > umpires of foul play and being deprived of the prize he became mad through > grief and returned to Astypalaea. Attacking a school there of about sixty > children he pulled down the pillar which held up the roof. [7] This fell > upon the children, and Cleomedes, pelted with stones by the citizens, took > refuge in the sanctuary of Athena. He entered a chest standing in the > sanctuary and drew down the lid. The Astypalaeans toiled in vain in their > attempts to open the chest. At last, however, they broke open the boards of > the chest, but found no Cleomedes, either alive or dead. So they sent envoys > to Delphi to ask what had happened to Cleomedes. [8] The response given by > the Pythian priestess was, they say, as follows:— “Last of heroes is > Cleomedes of Astypalaea; Honor him with sacrifices as being no longer a > mortal.\" So from this time have the Astypalaeans paid honors to Cleomedes as > to a hero. Translation 2 > “In the Olympiad before that one they say that Kleomêdês the Astupalaian > killed the Epidaurian Hippos while boxing him. When he was charged by the > referees with cheating and was deprived of the victory, he went out of his > mind with grief and returned to Astupalaia. There, he attacked a school > there which held as many as sixty children and knocked down the pillar which > supported the roof. After the roof fell on the children, the citizens threw > stones at Kleomêdês and he fled into the Temple of Athena. Inside, he > climbed into a chest and closed the lid over him. The Astupalaians wore > themselves out trying to open or break the chest. When they finally broke > open the chest and did not find Kleomêdês there dead or alive, they send > representatives to Delphi to ask what kind of thing had happened with > Kleomêdês. The Pythia is said to have given the oracle that: \"Kleomêdês the > Astupalaian was the last of the heroes— Honor him with sacrifices since he > is no longer mortal.” For this reason the Astupalaians have honored > Kleomêdês as a hero since that time.\" Between different translations Kleomêdês kills either Ikos, Iccus or Hippos, but the story isn't ultimately changed by this. == References == * Category:Ancient sportspeople Category:5th-century BC deaths Category:4th- century BC births Category:Ancient Greeks",
