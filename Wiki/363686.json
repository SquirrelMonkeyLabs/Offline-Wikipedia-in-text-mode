He was President of the Philippine revolutionary government from 1897 to 1901. ==Early life and career== Aguinaldo was born in Kawit, Cavite belonging to a very political family. His father, for example, was gobernadorcillo and so was his older brother, Crisopulo. Because of political influence within the family, Aguinaldo would later pursue to become cabeza de barangay in his hometown of Kawit. He then became Capitan Municipal. ==The Katipunan and Magdalo== He joined the Katipunan in 1895 during his service as Capitan Municipal of Kawit. After the start of the revolution in Cavite, two revolutionary governments became very influential inside the region. These are the Magdalo leadership and the Magdiwang leadership. The Magdalo leadership was under the guidance of Baldomero Aguinaldo, Aguinaldo's cousin. Because the two governments dislike each other, Andres Bonifacio, the leader of Katipunan, wanted them to become close friends. During the Tejeros Convention, a meeting was held to unite two governments. An election was also held so that they will have a president for the new revolutionary government. After the election, Emilio won to become the new leader but was disliked by Andres Bonifacio. According to Daniel Tirona, Aguinaldo was the right leader for the new government because he graduated as a lawyer unlike Bonifacio. == References == == Other websites == * Emilio Aguinaldo * Emilio Aguinaldo * Emilio Aguinaldo Category:1869 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Presidents of the Philippines Category:Filipino autobiographers Category:Politicians from Cavite",
