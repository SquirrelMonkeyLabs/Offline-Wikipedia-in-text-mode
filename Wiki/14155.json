 "text": "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a declaration (something said in an important way) by the United Nations General Assembly. It talks about basic human rights -- rights that all people have just because they are human. It was adopted (agreed to) by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948. The UDHR (initialism for Universal Declaration of Human Rights) is translated into over 300 languages. This is more languages than any other document, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. == Important ideas == The UDHR may be broken into 30 parts or articles. Each article says one idea about human rights. Most people think these are the most important ideas: * All people are born free and equal, because they have reason and conscience. * Everyone has a right to life, liberty, and security of their person. * Everyone should be protected from any kind of discrimination. * Everyone has a right to have a nationality and change one's nationality. * Everyone has a right to an education. * Everyone has a right to get a job. * Everyone has a right to vote and take part in the government of one's own country. * Everyone has a right to take part in cultural life—to choose a way of life. * No person may be tortured, or treated in a cruel or unkind way. * Everyone has the right to seek and gain asylum from persecution. * Everyone has a right to have ideas or opinions, to decide what is right and what is wrong, and to choose a religion. * Everyone has a right to speak or write freely and right to join a peaceful group to express one's opinion. * Everyone has a right to security if suffering unemployment, disease, disability, old age or loss of a partner. * Everyone has duties to the community where one's personality can be developed freely. * No one can use the Declaration as a reason to take away these rights and freedoms. == Rights == Below is a simplified list of all of the UDHR rights. 1\\.

Mainly Islamic countries have pointed out that its understanding is mainly that of Christians or Jews. Muslims could not implement certain parts of the declaration, without trespassing Islamic law.Littman, David. \"Universal Human Rights and Human Rights in Islam\". Midstream, February/March 1999 https://web.archive.org/web/20060501234759/http://mypage.bluewin.ch/ameland/Islam.html On 30 June 2000, Muslim nations that are members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference officially resolved to support the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, an alternative document that says people have \"freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari’ah\". ==References== == Other websites == *Text of the UDHR at the United Nations website explained in Plain English *Text of the UDHR at the United Nations website Category:United Nations Category:1948 Category:Human rights",
