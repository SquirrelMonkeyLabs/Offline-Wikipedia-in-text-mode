 "text": "Dentistry in the United Kingdom is partly a free part of the National Health Service and partly paid for privately. Most dentists run private businesses. UK dentists are regulated by the General Dental Council and the Care Quality Commission. If they do NHS work they are paid for activity. There are contracts which sets down what they will be paid for and how much. They are different in the different part of the United Kingdom. Before the NHS started in 1948 many people paid to have their teeth taken out because they were afraid of the cost of dentistry. In 2023 there were still many people over the age of 85 with no teeth. People who qualify for the NHS Low Income Scheme do not have to pay, but they have to find a dentist who does NHS work. Other people have to pay standard charges - £23.80 for an examination, £65.20 for fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth or £282.80 for more complex procedures, such as crowns, dentures and bridges. (2023 prices) In 2023 many dentists had stopped taking on NHS patients. Only one in five dental practices in Scotland were taking on new NHS patients. == References == Category:Healthcare in the United Kingdom Category:Dentistry",
