The king and queen, the prime minister, the general, the nanny, the cook, the admiral and also the gardener are not part of the court for the little princess, but first and foremost playmates. She idolises her teddy bear Gilbert and loves to romp around in the large castle park with her dog Scruff and her cat Puss. And if something breaks during her exploration tours, she chases away any trouble with her disarming smile. No one can be mad with this little princess.
