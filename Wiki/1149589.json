Bhanugupta's inscription from 510 CE, found in Eran, mentions his involvement in \"a great battle,\" and though the details are unclear, it has been interpreted by some as indicating his role in Toramana's defeat. ==Battle== Toramana was eventually defeated by local Indian rulers, with the ruler Bhanugupta sometimes credited with his defeat. Bhanugupta's 510 CE inscription from Eran refers to his involvement in a \"great battle,\" but the details of this conflict are vague, leaving room for various interpretations. Some scholars, such as Mookerji, suggest that the inscription, along with references in the Manjusri-mula-kalpa, imply that Bhanugupta was actually defeated by Toramana in the battle at Eran, leading to the western Gupta province of Malwa falling under Huna control. In this scenario, Toramana would have been recognized as the ruler of the region, as noted in the Eran boar inscription. Toramana was decisively defeated by King Prakashadharma of the Aulikara dynasty of Malwa after nearly 20 years of his presence in India. According to the Rīsthal stone-slab inscription, which was discovered in 1983, this victory occurred in 515 CE. Prakashadharma was a notable king of this dynasty, who assumed the title, Adhiraja. The Rīsthal inscription gives us information about his achievements. The First Hunnic War ended with a defeat for the Huns, and their army reportedly withdrew to the Punjab region. The Manjusri-mula-kalpa just says that Toramana died in Benares while he was heading back west after fighting Narasimhagupta. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:Battles of the Middle Ages",
