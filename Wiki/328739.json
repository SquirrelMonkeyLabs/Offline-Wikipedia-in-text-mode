 "text": "Bride of Frankenstein (sometimes The Bride of Frankenstein) is a 1935 Universal Pictures science fiction horror movie. It is a sequel to Universal's Frankenstein (1931). Bride was directed by James Whale. It stars Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester, Colin Clive and Ernest Thesiger. The movie is based on a subplot in the book Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. It picks up where the movie Frankenstein leaves off. In Bride, Henry Frankenstein drops his work in the laboratory. The Monster wants a mate. He forces Henry to create one. Preparations for making Bride began shortly after Frankenstein opened in theaters. Photography started in January 1935. Many of the actors and crew from Frankenstein returned for Bride. Critics and audiences loved the movie, but the censors found fault. Today, the movie is considered Whale's masterpiece. The director and others involved in the production were homosexuals. Some viewers detect a gay sensibility in the movie. Some of Whale's associates have dismissed the idea. ==References== == Other websites == * * Category:1935 movies Category:1930s horror movies Category:1930s science fiction movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:American science fiction horror movies Category:Black-and-white movies Category:English- language movies Category:Frankenstein movies Category:Monster movies Category:American sequel movies Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:Universal Pictures movies Category:Mad scientist movies",
