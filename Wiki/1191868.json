 "text": "Light in painting has many important roles, both practical and artistic. On one side, light is key for showing what the artist wants to represent. It helps us see the image and affects things like color, texture, and shape. On the other side, light also adds beauty. Artists use light and shadow together to shape the look of the painting and express certain moods or ideas. Sometimes, light can even have a symbolic meaning, especially in religious art, where it often represents something divine or holy. Our eyes need light to see art, so it is essential for us to view a painting. Light is also a part of the painting itself. The way light and shadow interact is the base of drawing, and when mixed with color, it shapes how we see depth and form. Artists have developed many techniques to show light in paintings over time, like shading, chiaroscuro (using strong contrasts of light and dark), sfumato (soft transitions), and tenebrism (dramatic lighting). Light has been especially important in art styles like the Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionism, and Fauvism. When artists focus a lot on showing light in their work, it’s called “luminism.” This word is used for several styles, including Baroque tenebrism, Impressionism, and movements from the late 1800s to early 1900s, such as American, Belgian, and Valencian luminism.
