Fossil remains have been found in Europe. == Description == Euthynotus had a slender body. The skull was quite long and narrow, with a slightly pointed snout. The dorsal fin was small and placed far away. == Systematics == === Species === Euthynotus has two species: * †Euthynotus incognitus Blainville, 1818 * †Euthynotus intermedius Agassiz, 1839 === Synonyms === * Parathrissops Sauvage, 1891 == Species info == === Euthynotus incognitus === Euthynotus incognitus is a species of Euthynotus. It is very much well-known. === Euthynotus intermedius === Euthynotus intermedius is another species of Euthynotus. Unlike the other species, it's not well-known. == Paleoecology == Like many pachycormiforms, Euthynotus was a predatory fish. The particularly long body of this fish made it very fast.
