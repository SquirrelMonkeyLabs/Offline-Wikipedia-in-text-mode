It was developed at the Koishikawa Arsenal and is named for its year of adoption in the Japanese dating system (the 26th year of the Meiji era, i.e., 1893). About 60,000 of these revolvers were produced between 1893 and 1935. This revolver saw use in the Russo-Japanese War, Second Sino-Japanese War, World War I and World War II.
