 "text": "In mathematics, the range is a concept which has various meanings in different topics: * The range of a function f, also written as \\operatorname{ran}(f) or \\operatorname{Range}(f), is the set of elements that the function outputs. * In statistics, the range is the difference between the lowest and highest values. For example. in {4, 6, 9, 3, 7}, the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9, so the range is 9-3 = 6. * In some occasions, the term \"range\" can also refer to the mathematical concept of interval. == Related pages == * Surjective function == References == Category:Functions and mappings Category:Mathematics",
