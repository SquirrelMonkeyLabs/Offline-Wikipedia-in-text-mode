 "text": "Neon Genesis Evangelion (Japanese: 新世紀エヴァンゲリオン Hepburn: Shin Seiki Evangelion) is a Japanese anime series directed by Hideaki Anno, and produced by Gainax and Tatsunoko Production. It is set 15 years after a world-wide disaster. The main characters are teenagers that pilot giant robots called \"Evangelions\" to fight giant monsters called \"angels.\" The imagery is inspired by depression, philosophy, and the religions Christianity and Judaism. The show was liked by critics, but the ending made many fans angry. The film End of Evangelion was released in 1997. It acts as a different version of the show's ending. Other related media, including several manga, soundtracks, a light novel and the Rebuild of Evangelion film series, were made following the show’s success. == Related pages == * List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters == References == Category:Anime Category:Gainax",
