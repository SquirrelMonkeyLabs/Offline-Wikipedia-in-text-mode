She used rats as test subjects during her research because their nervous system is very similar to humans. They discovered brain cells that allow animals to move from one place to another. These are called grid cells, and they fire when the rats pass a certain location. Over time, this helped the rats move purposely around the room and navigate their surroundings. The Mosers won a Nobel Prize, an important award. She won this award in 2014 and shared this with John O’Keefe, another neuroscientist. They also won the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize.\"Nobel Prize Recap for 2014.\" Historic World Events, Gale, 2015. Student Resources in Context. Accessed 12 Apr. 2017.
