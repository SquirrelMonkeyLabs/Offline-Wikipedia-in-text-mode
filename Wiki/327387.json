His descendants were Chaudhary Rai Bular (died 1515), who was a devotee of Guru Nanak Dev (1469-1539), the founder of the Sikh religion. Guru Nanak's parents were from Amritsar District area, as his father Mehta Kalu got a new job as a patwari of the village of Rai Bhoi Di Talwandi (now Nankana Sahib), in the Sandal Bar region of Punjab.
