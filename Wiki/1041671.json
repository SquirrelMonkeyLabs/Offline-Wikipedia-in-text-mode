 "text": "The Koadaikanal bush frog (Raorchestes dubois) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists saw this frog in Kodaikanal in the Western Ghat mountains, about 1900-2300 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 19.2 mm to 20.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 25.1 mm to 25.3 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is green in color with some silver and blue- purple. There is a mark in the shape of a V on the frog's back from the eyes to the rear end. The back and sides have black, brown, silver, and purple spots. The iris of the eye is gold-brown in color with some green and brown. The ends of the toes are white. The sides of the belly have yellow-brown marks. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, these frogs hatch from eggs as small frogs. They do not swim as tadpoles. Scientists named this frog for Alain Dubois of the Paris Museum of Natural History. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
