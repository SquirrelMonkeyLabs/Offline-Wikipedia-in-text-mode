 "text": "In the history of Manipur, a Meitei princess, also known as Manipuri princess (), was a female member of the royal family belonging to the Meitei ethnic group, the dominant community of Manipur. Historically, Meitei princesses held positions within the sociopolitical and cultural framework of the Kingdom of Manipur, often involved in ceremonial functions and, at times, administrative affairs. Their roles and status were shaped by the traditional norms and hierarchical structures of Meitei society. At various points in history, Meitei princesses became queens in neighboring kingdoms, including the Ahom kingdom, the Burmese kingdom, the Cachar kingdom, and the Tripura kingdom, through diplomatic marriage alliances arranged between royal families.Manipur, Past and Present: The Heritage and Ordeals of a Civilization.
