 "text": "London Drugs is a Canadian chain of pharmacies. They are headquartered in Richmond, British Columbia. They have 78 store locations all across Western Canada. They sell products like pharmaceuticals, groceries, photofinishing, and other retail items. In 1945, Sam Bass opened the first London Drugs store on the corner of Main and Union Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. He named it after the city of London. In 1968, Bass sold London Drugs to the U.S.-based Daylin, Inc. conglomerate. They did not see success with the company and decided to see it the next year to the Canadian-based H.Y. Louie Group. After this sale, the company saw a large increase of business in Western Canada and grew very fast. In 2024, there was a ransomware attack on the company and they had to shut down stores because of it. The cybercriminal gang LockBit demanded $25 million in 48 hours or they were going to release sensitive data. London Drugs did not pay and employee data was released but customer data was not. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1945 establishments in Canada Category:Companies based in British Columbia Category:Department stores of Canada Category:Pharmacies of Canada",
