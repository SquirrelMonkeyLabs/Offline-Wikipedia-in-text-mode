After the war, Braniff began flying to South America. It served Brazil, Argentina, Columbia and Peru. Braniff became the first all-jet airline in 1960. After the airline deregulation of 1978, Braniff found the air fare competition cut into profits. The recession had caused fewer passengers. Braniff found itself with too many air routes. With rising interest rates and fuel prices, the company debt became a major problem. Braniff declared bankruptcy in 1982. Its last flight was on May 12, 1982. ==Gallery== File:Boeing 727-27C, Braniff International Airways JP6867322.jpg|A Braniff Boeing 727 at O'Hare International Airport File:British Aircraft Corporation BAC 1-11 Series 203AE, Braniff International Airways JP6839068.jpg|Braniff aircraft at Dallas Love Field.
