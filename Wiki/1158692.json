 "text": "Allobates juanii is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== People have seen this frog in small pieces of forest and in gardens. People have not seen it in big forests. Scientists think it only lives near streams where the water moves quickly. It lives on the ground and it is awake during the day. Scientists saw the frog between 313 and 850 meters above sea level. Scientists think the frog might live in some protected parks: Reserva Forestal Protectora Nacional Caño Vanguardia, Reserva Forestal Protectora Nacional Cerro Vanguardia, Reserva Forestal Protectora Nacional Quebrada Honda y Caños Parrado y Buque Parque Ecologico Humedal Zuria, and Parque Ecologico Humedal Caracoli. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. Scientists think the male frog watches the eggs. Scientists think that, after the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to small streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to build towns and dig good rocks out of the ground. Bad chemicals in the water can also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
