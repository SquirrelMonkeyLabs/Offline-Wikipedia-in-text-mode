 "text": "Terrestrial television is a type of television broadcasting where the television signal is sent by radio waves from a transmitter on the land. In North America, it is usually called over-the-air television (OTA). This type of TV is different to newer types such as satellite, cable, and IPTV. TV is broadcast between 52 and 600 MHz in the VHF and UHF radio bands. This can be sent in digital or the older analog format. Many countries switched (or are switching) to digital and turned off the analog signals. Category:Television technology",
