 "text": "Partial differential equations (abbreviated as PDEs) are a kind of mathematical equation. They are related to partial derivatives, in that obtaining an antiderivative of a partial derivative involves integration of partial differential equations. ==Numerical methods== Since PDEs have appeared in mathematics and physics, many scientists have studied methods to solve them. But unfortunately, no one could establish methods to solve any kind of PDE. Therefore, numerical methods for PDEs (such as the finite element method) are widely studied since the appearance of computers.Iserles, A. (2009).
