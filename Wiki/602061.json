It is on First Avenue in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It is also home to FDNY EMS Station 08, formerly NYC*EMS Station 13. The hospital handles nearly 460,000 non-emergency outpatient clinic visits, nearly 106,000 emergency visits and some 30,000 inpatients each year. More than 80 percent of Bellevue’s patients come from the city’s medically underserved populations. The hospital currently occupies a 25-story patient care facility with an ICU, digital radiology communication and an outpatient facility. The hospital has an attending physician staff of 1,200 and an in-house staff of about 5,500. Bellevue was renamed in November 2015 as a reflection of its parent organization's rebranding. In 2014 Bellevue was ranked 40th overall in the New York metro area and 29th in New York City by US News and World Report. ==References== Category:Hospitals in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan",
