 "text": "The Sovereign citizen movement is a loose political movement of tax protesters, conspiracy theorists, activists, auditors and certain other people who claim to be answerable only to their interpretation of laws and that governments and courts only have legitimate jurisdiction over them if they consent to be ruled. These people call themselves sovereign citizens, sovereign beings and similar terms. Sovereign citizens and their counterparts in British Commonwealth countries, freemen on the land, claim most forms of taxation, especially income taxes and property taxes, as illegitimate, and don't recognize government currencies as legal tender. The FBI classifies the sovereign citizen movement as a domestic terrorism movement. Category:Political movements",
