 "text": "\"Falling Down\" is the first single off of American rapper Lil Peep's second and final studio album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2. The song was released on September 19, 2018. American rapper XXXTentacion also appears on the song. The song was able to make it to #13 on the Billboard Hot 100, #35 on the Alternative Airplay, and #40 on the Rhythmic charts. It was also certified 3Ã— Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Since both rappers had died by then, the mothers of both Peep and X came together to accept the plaques. The originally recorded song was called \"Sunlight on Your Skin\" and was by iLoveMakonnen and Lil Peep. The song was left unfinished because Peep ended up dying from a drug overdose on November 15, 2017. Rapper XXXTentacion heard the snippet and iLoveMakonnen let X record a verse to replace his. Some of Peep's friends like fellow GothBoiClique member Fish Narc and rapper Lil Tracy didn't like that X was included because of his legal history. Fish and Tracy later retracted their statements with Fish saying that it was \"what [he] said in anger\". In the song, Peep raps about missing a girl and that things don't feel the same when she isn't around. Makonnen said that the name \"Falling Down\" was chosen because it was heavily pouring rain outside of the studio when they were recording the song in London. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2018 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Hip hop songs",
