 "text": "Urartian is the name for the language spoken by the people of the ancient kingdom of Urartu in northeast Anatolia (present-day Turkey), in the region of Lake Van. Urartian was a language isolate, which was neither Semitic nor Indo- European, but a member of the Hurro-Urartian family. There is a hypothesis that suggests that besides the cuneiform inscriptions of the Urartian language, Urartu had a native hieroglyphic writing system. Armenian scientist Artak Movsisyan published a partial attempt deciphering of Urartian hieroglyphs, saying that they were written in an early form of Armenian. ==Related pages== *Urartu == More reading == *C.
