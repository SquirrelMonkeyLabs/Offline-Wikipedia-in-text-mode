 "text": "Mir-Hossein Mousavi Khameneh (; born 29 September 1941) is an Iranian politician, painter and architect. He belongs to the Iranian reform movement. He was the fifth Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran from 1981 to 1989. After his term, the constitution was changed, and the post of prime minister was abolished. Mousavi is currently the president of the Iranian Academy of Arts. He also was a candidate for the 2009 presidential election. Before his post as prime minister, he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He is also a member of the Expediency Discernment Council and the High Council of Cultural Revolution. He has not attended their meetings for years. Political analysts think that he does not like these councils. In the early years of the revolution, Mousavi was the editor-in-chief of the official newspaper of the Islamic Republican Party, the Jomhouri-e Eslami (Islamic Republic) newspaper. In 2009 presidential election, Mousavi chose green as his campaign color, a color which has since become common in Iran. == References == Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Prime Ministers of Iran",
