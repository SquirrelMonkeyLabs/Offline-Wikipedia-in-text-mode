 "text": "VDSL or VHDSL (Very High Bitrate DSL) is a DSL technology providing faster data movement. This works over a single flat untwisted or twisted pair of copper wires. These fast speeds mean that VDSL can move data for digital television, as well as telephone services (Voice over IP) and Internet. It can do all these things on a single connection, using existing wiring used for POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service). ==Related pages== * List of device bandwidths * Gigabit DSL. == References == == Other websites == * ITU-T Recommendation G.993.1: Very high speed digital subscriber line transceivers * UK Broadband Usergroup * ThinkBroadband * The UNH-IOL DSL Knowledgebase (advanced tutorials) * Motorola Broadband * EFTel VDSL * Vdsl Technology and company news * VDSL2 chip vendor Metanoia communications Inc.
