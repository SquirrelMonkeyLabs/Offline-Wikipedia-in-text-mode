 "text": "The Hollywood Sign (formerly the Hollywoodland Sign) is a landmark and American cultural icon located in Los Angeles, California. It is near on Mount Lee, in the Hollywood Hills area of the Santa Monica Mountains. The sign overlooks Hollywood, Los Angeles. \"HOLLYWOOD\" is spelled out in -tall white capital letters and is long. It was originally created in 1923 as an advertisement for a local real estate development, but it gained increasing recognition after the sign was left up. The \"LAND\" section of the \"HOLLYWOODLAND\" sign was removed in September 1949, because the real estate developers did not want to use the sign to advertise the \"Hollywoodland\" housing development anymore, but to reflect the Hollywood district. The sign was a frequent target of pranks and vandalism, but it has since undergone restoration in 1978, including the installation of a security system to deter vandalism. The sign is protected and promoted by The Trust For Public Land, a nonprofit organization, while its site and the surrounding land are part of Griffith Park. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:Buildings and structures in Los Angeles Category:Symbols Category:Popular culture",
