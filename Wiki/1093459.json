United States Air Force general Curtis LeMay was nominated as his running mate. Wallace ran on a platform of law and order, states' rights, and an immediate withdrawal from the Vietnam War. In the 1968 United States presidential election, he came in third place, earning 13.53% of the popular vote, carrying 5 states, and being awarded 46 electoral votes. This was the second of four presidential campaigns by George Wallace. Wallace previously ran in the 1964 Democratic Party presidential primaries, where he lost the nomination to incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, and ran again in the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries, where he lost the nomination to George McGovern. He then later went on to run in the 1976 Democratic Party presidential primaries, where he lost the nomination to Jimmy Carter. == Endorsements == Georgia Governor Lester Maddox, who previously endorsed Wallace in 1964, endorsed Wallace again in 1968. == Related pages == * 1968 United States presidential election === Other 1968 presidential campaigns === * Hubert Humphrey 1968 presidential campaign * Richard Nixon 1968 presidential campaign === Other George Wallace presidential campaigns === * George Wallace 1964 presidential campaign * George Wallace 1972 presidential campaign * George Wallace 1976 presidential campaign == References == Category:1960s in the United States Category:United States presidential elections",
