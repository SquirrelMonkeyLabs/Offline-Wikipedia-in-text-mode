EA announced that some players likeness would be used in the game and they would be paid $600 for it. This came after a ruling by the United States Supreme Court which allowed players to be compensated for their likeness. ==Reception== The game recieved positive reviews by game critics. Critics said that they liked the gameplay, recruiting, atmosphere of the stadiums and crowds, and Dynasty mode. However, critics also felt that some game modes like Road to Glory did not have enough time put into it and some of the playcalling was limited in the career mode. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2024 video games Category:NCAA video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Sports video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
