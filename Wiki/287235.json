 "text": "Charles Rudolph Boysen (July 14, 1895 – November 25, 1950) was a California horticulturist. Boysen worked as Anaheim City Parks superintendent from 1921-1950. He created the boysenberry, a hybrid between several types of blackberries, raspberries, and loganberries. ==Boysenberry== Rudolph Boysen experimented with various berry crosses in Napa, California in the 1920s. In 1923, his hybrid successfully grew and bore fruit. However, unable to make his new berry a commercial success, Boysen abandoned his crop after breaking his back in an accident. Years later, after he had moved to Orange County, a fellow grower named Walter Knott heard about the berry and tracked down Boysen. Walter Knott was able to bring a few dying vines back to life at his farm, now known as Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California. Knott named the fruit after Boysen.“Oregon Raspberry and Blackberry Commission http://www.oregon-berries.com/boysenberry.cfm Knott's Berry Farm Historical Background http://www.knotts.com/coinfo/history/index.shtml == References == ==Other websites== *Google link for Boysen Park *Charles Rudolph Boysen, Anaheim Superintendent of Parks *Boysen Park in Anaheim, California Category:1895 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Scientists from California",
