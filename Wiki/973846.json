 "text": "Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is a turn-based game for the Nintendo Switch. It is the first to combine Mario series and Ubisoft's Rabbids series. It is the first tactics game in the Mario franchise. It incorporates some role- playing elements. The game sees Mario and his friends trying to restore order in the Mushroom Kingdom. The Rabbids invaded and fused it with their own world using a powerful merging device. The player takes control of Beep-0, a robotic assistant who guides characters. Beep-0 can perform various actions to solve puzzles and find secrets. Throughout their journey, the heroes frequently engage in turn-based battles with enemy Rabbids. They must complete objectives such as defeating a number of enemies or escorting a supporting character to a certain spot. Each character's abilities in battle can be customized and upgraded via a skill tree. The game has a single-player story mode and a local co-operative mode. That has separate stages in which multiple human players can face off against enemy Rabbids. A Versus mode was added through an update, enabling players to battle each other locally. The game also offers paid add- on content with new weapons, challenges, and a story focusing on Donkey Kong. Ubisoft published the game for most territories (the Americas, EMEA, Oceania, Southeast Asia) in August 2017. Nintendo published the game for Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in January 2018. Ubisoft later re-published the game digitally for Hong Kong in June 2018. Ubisoft's Chinese partner, Bihan Internet Technology published the game for mainland China in February 2022. A sequel, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, was released on October 20, 2022 in most countries.
