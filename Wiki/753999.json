The word is comes from the Latin initialis, which means standing at the beginning. An initial is often several lines in height and in older books or manuscripts. In some cases a name or title can be long so the initials would shorten them. Examples include: JFK, FDR, AOC, TDK, NYC, USA, KUWTK, EU, etc. ==Related pages== * Abbreviation ==Other websites== * Typolis.de * Types of illuminated initials in the Glossary of Medieval Art and Architecture * Ornamento Ornamento contains close to a quarter of a million ornate letters, ornaments, borders, musical notation, diagrams, and illustrations drawn from Iberian print before 1701. * Initials and Ornaments by Book Historian on Flickr.com * Alphabets & Letters at Reusableart.com Category:Typography",
