 "text": "North Manchester General Hospital (NMGH) is a large NHS hospital in Crumpsall, North Manchester. The buildings are not in good condition. There is a plan to rebuild the hospital. It was one of the 40 new hospitals Boris Johnson promised in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto. In January 2023 the managers complained that building had not started. Delay was putting the cost up. The cost had gone up 30% to Â£976 million. The ceiling had fallen down so the operating theatres had to be closed for 6 weeks. In November 2022 a new garden for patients and staff was opened at the Intensive Care Unit. == History == Springfield Hospital was a workhouse. It opened in 1853. It was called the Crumpsall Institution. It was for people who were mentally ill. Later it was called Park House. Delaunays Hospital was also built as a workhouse. It opened in 1869. Crumpsall Hospital was built for the Manchester Union Workhouse. It opened in 1876. It had 1,440 beds in 1928 with 600 more in the mental department. All three were taken over by the National Health Service in 1947. They were joined together to make North Manchester General Hospital in 1977. Since 2020 it is managed by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. == References == Category:Hospitals in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Manchester",
