He demonstrated in his music video for \"Killa Cam\", where he was wearing all pink clothing and drove a pink Range Rover. Cam'ron started the \"Stop Snitchin'\" campaign after he was shot outside a nightclub in his Lamborghini. The gunman was trying to carjack him. Cam'ron said in a 60 Minutes interview that he did not know the gunman. He did not want to help the police because he did not want to be a snitch and it would hurt his record sales. He also mentioned his Stop Snitchin' campaign in another 60 Minutes interview when Anderson Cooper asked him, \"If there was a serial killer living next to you, you wouldn't tell the police?\" He replied, \"I would probably move.\" == Studio albums == Cam'ron has released 7 studio albums: Year Album 1998 Confessions of Fire 2000 S.D.E. 2002 Come Home with Me 2004 Purple Haze 2006 Killa Season 2009 Crime Pays 2010 Killa Season 2 ==Filmography== * Paid in Full (2002) *Death of a Dynasty (2003) * State Property 2 (2005) * Killa Season (2006) * Rap Sheet: Hip-Hop and the Cops (2006) * First Of The Month (2012) * Percentage (2013) * Love & Hip Hop: New York (2012; 2016â€“2017) * Honor Up (2018) * Queens (2021) == References == ==Other websites== * Cam'ron's Myspace Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Rappers from New York (state) Category:Musicians from New York City",
