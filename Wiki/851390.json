 "text": "The Teen Talwar (Three Swords) monument is located in Clifton, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. The three marble swords are inscribed with Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's creeds Unity, Faith and Discipline. It was commissioned by Pakistan's former President and Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1973. Therefore it is considered as the “National Icon of Pakistan”. The initial concept was for the three swords to be shown in the PPP's electoral colours (black, green and red). Later, the idea was changed to white marble.
