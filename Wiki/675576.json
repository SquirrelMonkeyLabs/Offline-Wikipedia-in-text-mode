 "text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district began on January 11, 2019. On October 19, 2018, Politico said that Gabbard was \"weighing a 2020 presidential bid\" but would not make an announcement until after the 2018 midterm elections. On December 12, 2018, on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, Gabbard said she was \"seriously considering\" running for president in 2020. In a January 11, 2019 interview with CNN's Van Jones, Gabbard announced her plans to run for the Democratic presidential nomination and said she would officially announce \"within the next week.\" After failing to qualify in recent debates or winning any primary contests, Gabbard left the race on March 19, 2020, and supported Joe Biden. ==References== Gabbard",
