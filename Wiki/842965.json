 "text": "The Cairo Trilogy ( 'The Trilogy' or 'The Cairo Trilogy') is a trilogy of novels written by the Egyptian novelist and Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz. It is one of the best known works of his literary career. ==Translations== The Cairo Trilogy was first translated into Hebrew between 1981 and 1987. Mahfouz was very satisfied by this and saw it as another proof that the Israeli- Egyptian peace treaty of 1979 should be supported. The English translation was published by Doubleday in the early 1990s. The translators were: * Palace Walk - William M. Hutchins and Olive Kenny * Palace of Desire - Hutchins, Olive Kenny and Lorne Kenny * Sugar Street - Hutchins, Olive Kenny and Angele Botros Samaan The translation was overseen by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, an editor at Doubleday at the time, and Martha Levin. ==References== Category:Novels Category:Egyptian culture Category:1956 books",
