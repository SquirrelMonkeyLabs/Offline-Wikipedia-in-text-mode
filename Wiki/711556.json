 "text": "A cradle of civilization is a place where civilization emerged. There was no single \"cradle\", but several civilizations that developed independently. The Fertile Crescent (Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia), Ancient Indus Valley, and Ancient China were the first.Cradles of Civilization-China: ancient culture, modern land. Robert E. Murowchick, gen. ed. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994 Whether there was influence between the early civilizations of the Near East and those of East Asia is not known. Scholars accept that the civilizations of Mesoamerica emerged independently and later than those in Eurasia. They were mainly in modern Mexico, and Norte Chico, in the north- central coastal region of Peru. Civilization involves the use of writing, building cities, a class-based society, agriculture, animal husbandry, public buildings, metallurgy, and monumental architecture.Understanding early civilizations: a comparative study, Trigger, Bruce G. 2007. Cambridge University Press. The term cradle of civilization has been applied to a variety of cultures and areas, in particular the Ancient Near Eastern Chalcolithic and Fertile Crescent, Ancient Indus Valley and Ancient China. It has also been applied to ancient Anatolia, the Levant and Iranian plateau, and used to refer to culture predecessorsâ€”such as Ancient Greece as the predecessor of Western civilization. == References == Category:Ancient history",
