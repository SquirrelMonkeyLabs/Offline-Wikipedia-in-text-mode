 "text": "The WWE Divas Championship was a professional wrestling championship made in 2008 by WWE. The wrestlers with the most reigns as Divas Champion are Eve Torres and AJ Lee with 3 each. The longest reigning champion is Nikki Bella with the aid of her sister Brie Bella, holding the championship for 301 days. There is no longer a Divas championship as the WWE doesn't want the women to be classed as a diva and now calls them WWE Superstars like the men. The WWE Women's Championship replaced the title at WrestleMania 32. ==Title history== # Order in reign history Reign The reign number for the specific set of wrestlers listed Location The city in which the title was won Event The event in which the title was won — Used for vacated reigns so as not to count it as an official reign \\+ Indicates the current reign is changing daily # Wrestler Reigns Date Days Held Location Event Notes Ref. 1 Michelle McCool 1 Uniondale, NY McCool defeated Natalya to become the first champion.
