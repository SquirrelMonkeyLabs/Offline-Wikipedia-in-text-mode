 "text": "Folate is a B vitamin, also called Bg or folacin. The man-made folic acid is a diet supplement which the body converts to folate. Folate is essential for the body to make DNA and RNA, and use the amino acids needed for cell division. So this particular chemical is truly essential for life. Folate is got by eating leafy green vegetables, legumes and organ meats. When cooking, the advice is to use steaming or a microwave oven. This keeps more folate in the cooked foods. == References == Category:B vitamins Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Organonitrogen compounds",
