 "text": "The American Fork River, in Utah, leaves the Wasatch Mountains out of American Fork Canyon about southeast of Salt Lake City. The river starts on Mount Timpanogos and the river runs down through American Fork Canyon. On the way it goes through the Uinta National Forest and Timpanogos Cave National Monument. Leaving the canyon, the river runs through northern Utah County and empties into Utah Lake on the north shore. ==References== Category:Rivers of Utah",
