He appointed himself as the Chairman of the State Administration Council since 2 February 2021. He has been accused of corruption many times during his military career. In February 2021, he removed the elected government led by de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi from power in a coup d'état on 1 February 2021. He was Joint Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence from 2010 to 2011. He is also a member of the National Defence and Security Council (NDSC) chaired by the president of Myanmar. He was promoted to four-star General in 2011 and five-star General in 2013. ==2020 election== In November 2020, Min Aung Hlaing questioned if the results of the 2020 election were reliable. On 5 November, his military rank was promoted to be equal to that of Vice President of Myanmar. After voting in the 2020 election, Min Aung Hlaing said he would accept the election results. He lost the election and called the election a fraud. On 27 January 2021, Min Aung Hlaing said he was thinking about a coup d'état and remove the Constitution, if allegations of voter fraud during last year’s election were not investigated. These comments sparked concern about another potential coup in the country. The next day, the Union Election Commission said there was no claims to voter fraud. On 29 January, the military said they would protest the election results. ==2021 military coup and national's ruler== On 1 February, Min Aung Hlaing led the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, one day before the democratically-elected members of parliament were scheduled to be sworn in as members of the Assembly of the Union.

On November 27, 2024, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court filed a request for an arrest warrant against Min Aung Hlaing for alleged crimes against humanity. ==Personal life== Min Aung Hlaing is married to Kyu Kyu Hla, a retired lecturer.
