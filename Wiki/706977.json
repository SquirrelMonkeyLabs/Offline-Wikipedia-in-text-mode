 "text": "The Kar98 (Kar98k) is a German bolt-action rifle and it was the German military's main gun during World War II. It is a carbine version of the G98. The Kar98k was made because the G98 was too long to be used well in small spaces. Other Differences were that the Kar98k had its bolt turned down, so the troops can keep aiming while they cycle the bolt. This was helpful, yet they did not put more ammunition into it, only having 5 rounds still. At the end of World War II, many German soldiers had to give up their weapons, including the Kar98k. Despite it being the main gun used by Nazi Germany, it was often used by Israeli soldiers in the 1947-1949 Palestine War. Category:Rifles",
