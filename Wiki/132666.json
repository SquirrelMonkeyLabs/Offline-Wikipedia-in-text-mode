 "text": "An antioxidant is a molecule that can slow or stop the oxidation, or electron transfer, of other molecules. Antioxidants can be found in food. Antioxidants are molecules that relieve oxidative stress by preventing the formation and oxidation of free radicals. Antioxidants donate one of their electrons or hydrogen to free radicals, stopping their chain reaction. Found in our diet (for example, in vitamins) or formed inside our body (like enzymes), antioxidants can protect us from the damaging effects of free radicals. The best way to combat free radicals is to have a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, red wine, and green tea. These functional foods are rich in phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. Health supplements enriched with antioxidants are also now widely available. ==References== *Afzal, M., Armstrong, D. (2002). “Fractionation of herbal medicine for identifying antioxidant activity”.
