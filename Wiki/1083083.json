 "text": "Nicole Holliday is an American socio-phonetician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at Pomona College in Claremont, California. Holliday received her Ph.D. in linguistics from New York University, and her BA in linguistics and Spanish from The Ohio State University. She is also Chair of the Linguistic Society America’s Committee on Ethnic Diversity in Linguistics. == Career == Holliday’s studies focus on different ways people use language to show their identities. Do they use language that is common with a racial or cultural group? Is their language fancy, saying they have many years of education? When someone speaks, what do other people assume about them because of their words? She is especially interested in language and racial identification. Her Ph.D. dissertation focused on how people with one black parent and one white parent use variation in language to form their own identities. == References == Category:American linguists",
