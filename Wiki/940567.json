 "text": "The Palembangnese also known as Palembang Malay (Baso Palembang) or Musi is an Austronesian language spoken by Palembang Malay in South Sumatra, Indonesia. It has two separate but mutually intelligible dialect chains: Sari-sari and Jegho. It has become a lingua franca throughout major population centers in the province, and is often used polyglossically with Indonesian and other regional languages and dialects in the area. Palembang language is a form of mixed language between the Malay and Javanese. Since parts of South Sumatra used to be under direct Javanese rule for quite a long time, the speech varieties of Palembang and its surrounding area are influenced by the Javanese down to their core vocabularies. ==References== ===Notes=== Category:Languages of Indonesia Category:South Sumatra",
