 "text": "The Vasco da Gama Pillar in Malindi, Kenya, was erected by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. It was constructed in 1498 or 1499 during his pioneering expedition from Lisbon to India via the Cape of Good Hope (1497–1499). ==History== Vasco da Gama visited Malindi from 15 to 24 April 1498. He was well received by the sultan of Malindi and was provided with food, fresh water and a pilot to take the trip across the Indian Ocean to Calicut (modern-day Kozhikode).Felipe Fernández-Armesto, Pathfinders: a Global History of Exploration (2006), pp.178-180 During the voyage, the explorer was allowed to erect a pillar, which included a cross made of Portuguese limestone. Most historians suggest that this happened on his return from India in 1499.J. S. Kirkman (ed.), The Portuguese Period in East Africa by Justus Strandes (Nairobi, 1961), p. 28. The pillar in Malindi is the only one, which erected along the coast of Africa by the Portuguese and survived in its original form.'Vasco da Gama Pillar', National Museums of Kenya website (accessed 19 July 2023) ==In modern times== The pillar today is Malindi's most visited heritage site. Restoration work carried out since 2020 has included repairs of the existing seawalls and the pillar itself, the construction of a access route and washrooms for visitors.'Malindi Vasco Dagama Pillar gets Ksh.59M for facelift' KBC News (23 June 2023) Access to the pillar is subject to an entry ticket. ==Gallery== Vasco Dagama Pillar.jpg| Malindi - Vasco da Gama Kreuz (Denkmal) bei Ebbe.jpg| Pillar of Vasco da Gama 03.JPG| ==In popular culture== *Kenyan stamps of 1998 celebrated the quincentenary of Vasco da Gama's visit.'Anniversary of first visit by Portuguese ships to Malindi' (Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, 1998) One of the stamps showcased the pillar in an painter's impression that gave the pillar the traditional thin-column elevation rather than the conical form of the reinforced pillar and the massive cross visible today. *Vasco da Gama Pillar described and repeatedly mentioned in the novels “Once in Malindi”“Once in Malindi” — on Proza.ru, 2021 and “Our Wild Sex in Malindi”“Our Wild Sex in Malindi” by Andrei Gusev, 2020 .
