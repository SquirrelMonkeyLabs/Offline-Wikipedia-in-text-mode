 "text": "The Verdin (Auriparus flaviceps) is a small bird. It is the only species in the genus Auriparus, and the only species in the family found in the New World. The Verdin is a very small bird. At 4.5 inches in length, it rivals the Bushtit as one of the smallest passerines in North America. It is gray overall, and adults have a bright yellow head and rusty \"shoulder patch\" (the lesser coverts). Unlike the tits, it has a sharply pointed bill. Verdins are insectivores. They keep looking among the desert trees and scrubs. They usually live alone except when they pair up to make their nests. They are very friendly birds. Verdins occasionally try to get tidbits of dried sugar water from hummingbird feeders. Verdins always have and will live in southwestern United States and northern Mexico, ranging from southeastern California to Texas, throughout Baja California and into central Mexico, north of the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt.
