They are found almost everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals, though their population is getting smaller in the wild. This is because of habitat loss and illegal hunting. They lived in Europe for at least a million years until the end of the Pleistocene. The spotted hyena is the largest member of the Hyaenidae.

Hyenas are pack hunters. Their behaviors are still not well understand. However, their social system is not cooperative but competitive. Females take care of their own cubs only, and males are not interested in helping females with their cubs. Females are larger than males and they can control them.

Spotted hyenas hunt with a family group of about two to five other hyenas. The family lives in large communities (called \"clans\") which may have up to 80 individuals.Kruuk, Hans 1972.

After they have selected their prey, they chase them for a long time. They can run at speeds up to 60 km/h. Humans have known spotted hyenas for a long time.
