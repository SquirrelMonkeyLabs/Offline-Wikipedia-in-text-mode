 "text": "A referendum of the status of Puerto Rico is was held on November 3, 2020. It asked the people if they think Puerto Rico should become a U.S. State. It will happened same day as the gubernatorial and presidential elections, and others. The Puerto Rico Governor Wanda VÃ¡zquez Garced first spoke about this on May 16, 2020. This is the sixth time a referendum has been held to see if Puerto Rico should be a state. The last one of these happened in 2017. This referendum is not binding, meaning it still might not become a state even if there are more \"yes\" votes. This is because only the United States Congress can add new states. Both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party (the main two parties in Congress) said they would make Puerto Rico a state if their people wanted to. The question in the referendum is written in the same way as the referendums that made Alaska and Hawaii states in the 1950s. ==References== Category:November 2020 events Category:2020 elections Category:21st century in Puerto Rico Category:Referendums",
