 "text": "Sardinioides is an extinct genus of prehistoric myctophiforms from the Campanian. It is probably a sister group to the blackchins and lanternfishes. Fossils have been found in Europe and Lebanon. Sardinioides looked like a modern-day lanternfish. It could reach 5 or 10 cm in length. The fish's vertebrae had longitudinally striated centers. == Related pages == * Myctophum indicum == References == # Dietze, Kathrin (June 2009). \"Morphology and phylogenetic relationships of certain neoteleostean fishes from the Upper Cretaceous of Sendenhorst, Germany\".
