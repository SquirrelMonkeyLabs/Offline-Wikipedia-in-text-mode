 "text": "Sepultura is a Brazillian heavy metal band formed in 1984. They are based out of Belo Horizonte. The group has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. The brothers Max and Igor Cavalera started it in Belo Horizonte in 1984. The two brothers have left the band since, Max in 1996, and Igor in 2006, with American singer Derrick Green and drummer Jean Dolabella replacing them after their exits, although Dolabella left in 2011 to be replaced with Eloy Casagrande. ==History== The band's name is Portuguese for the word \"grave\". The Cavalera brothers chose this name after translating English band Motorhead's song called \"Dancing On Your Grave\". Singer Wagner Lamounier and bass player Paulo Jr. were the first stable members to join the band along the Cavaleras. Lamounier left after a year, and Max decided to sing and play guitar. The band added a second guitar player named Jairo Guedez. These members recorded their first album, Morbid Visions, in 1986. The song \"Troops of Doom\" from this album gave the band some popularity. Guedez left after the album was released, being replaced by Andreas Kisser. This line-up lasted until 1996 and did many things. They recorded five more albums from 1987 to 1996. Sepultura began to play music that sounded more like thrash metal than death or black metal for their next three albums: Schizophrenia (1987), Beneath The Remains (1989) and Arise (1991). Their next two albums sounded more like groove metal. They were named Chaos A.D. (1993) and Roots (1996). Popular songs from Chaos A.D. include \"Refuse/Resist\" and \"Territory\". On Roots, they had a song they recorded with the Brazilian Xavantes tribe called Itsari, who also toured with them. Conflicts between Max and the other members led to Max leaving the band. He was replaced with American singer Derrick Green. Although the band's album sales lowered with each album released with Green, he is still in the group. With Sepultura, Green has helped record the albums Against (1998), Nation (2001), Roorback (2003), Dante XXI (2006), A-Lex (2009) and Kairos (2011). After Sepultura released Dante XXI in 2006, Igor Cavalera left the band. A year later, he made up with his brother Max, and the two formed The Cavalera Conspiracy. Igor's first replacement in Sepultura was Jean Dolabella, who recorded A-Lex and Kairos with the band before quitting. The band's drummer today is Eloy Casagrande. == Members == === Current members === * Paulo Jr. – bass (1984–present, only live until 1991), backing vocals (1984–present); percussion (1993–1997) * Andreas Kisser – lead guitar, backing vocals (1987–present); lead vocals (1996–1998); bass (1987–1991, only in studio); rhythm guitar (1996–present) * Derrick Green – lead vocals (1997–present); percussion (2005–present); additional rhythm guitar (1998–2005) * Greyson Nekrutman – drums, percussion (2024–present) === Former members === * Max Cavalera - lead vocals , rhythm guitar , lead guitar , percussion * Igor Cavalera - drums , percussion * Cássio - rhythm guitar (1984) * Beto Pinga - drums (1984) * Wagner Lamounier - lead vocals (1984-1985) * Roberto \"Gato\" Raffan - bass (1984) * Roberto UFO - rhythm guitar (1984) * Julio Cesar Vieira Franco - lead guitar (1985) * Jairo Guedez - lead guitar, studio bass, backing vocals (1985-1987) * Jean Dolabella - drums, percussion (2006-2011) * Eloy Casagrande - drums, percussion (2011-2024) == Discography == * Morbid Visions (1986) * Schizophrenia (1987) * Beneath the Remains (1989) * Arise (1991) * Chaos A.D.
