 "text": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (; 12 August 192417 August 1988) was a Pakistani military officer and politician who was the sixth president of Pakistan from 1978 until his death in 1988. == Early life == He was born in Jalandhar, Punjab. He died in a plane crash in Bahawalpur Punjab. Before he was president, he was chief martial law administrator from 1977, when martial law had been declared for the third time in the country's history. == Career == His reign is regarded as one of the longest-serving regimes in Pakistan, as he ruled nine years. It was a very cruel and bad time for most Pakistani people. He also helped the United States in fighting against the Soviet Union during the Soviet war in Afghanistan and in the process, he ruined his own country also. == Death == Zia died in a plane crash on 17 August 1988. After witnessing a US M1 Abrams tank demonstration in Bahawalpur, Zia had left the small town in the Punjab province by C-130B Hercules aircraft. The aircraft departed from Bahawalpur Airport and was expected to reach Islamabad International Airport. Shortly after a smooth takeoff, the control tower lost contact with the aircraft. Witnesses who saw the plane in the air afterward claim it was flying erratically, then nosedived and exploded on impact. In addition to Zia, 31 others died in the plane crash, including chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Akhtar Abdur Rahman, close associate of Zia, Brigadier Siddique Salik, the American Ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Lewis Raphel and General Herbert M. Wassom, the head of the US Military aid mission to Pakistan.Foreign affairs Pakistan by Pakistan. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (MOFA, 1988)\"Plea in court to revive C-130 crash case\" Business Recorder, 22 April 1996 Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Senate chairman announced Zia's death on radio and TV. Conditions surrounding his death have given rise to many conspiracy theories. There is speculation that the United States, India, the Soviet Union (in retaliation for Pakistani support of the mujahideen in Afghanistan) or an alliance of them and internal groups within Zia's military were behind the incident. A board of inquiry was set up to investigate the crash. It concluded 'the most probable cause of the crash was a criminal act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft'. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which would explain why no Mayday signal was given.The History and Culture of Pakistan by Nigel Kelly. There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A flight recorder (black box) was not located after the crash even though previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed. Maj. Gen. (retd) Mahmud Ali Durrani, who was suspected by many circles within Pakistan and also by the then United States Ambassador to India, John Gunther Dean, for being \"extraordinarily insistent\" with President Zia to visit the demonstration, is considered to be the prime suspect in the incident.John Gunther Dean. Oral history at jimmycarterlibrary He claimed later that reports of Israeli and Indian involvement in Zia's plane crash were only speculations and he rejected the statement that was given by former president Ghulam Ishaq Khan that the presidential plane was blown up in the air. Durrani stated that Zia's plane was destroyed while landing. Lt. General Hameed Gul, the head of Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence agency at the time, suggested that the United States might be responsible, even though the U.S. Ambassador and military attaché were also killed. He told The Times that the Pakistani President was killed in a conspiracy involving a \"foreign power\". == References == Category:1924 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Aviation deaths Category:Former dictators Category:Pakistani generals Category:Presidents of Pakistan Category:Politicians from Punjab, Pakistan",
