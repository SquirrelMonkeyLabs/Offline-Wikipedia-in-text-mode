 "text": "The Philippines women's national football team is a women's association football team from Philippines. They are managed by the Philippine Football Federation (PFF), which is in charge of football in the country. The Philippines started their women's national football team in the 1980s. They often take part in the AFC Women's Asian Cup, which started in 1981 when it was called the AFC Women's Championship. In 1999, the Philippines hosted the AFC Women's Championship in Iloilo and Bacolod. They didn't join the tournament for a while after 2003, but they came back in 2018 after qualifying in 2017. That time, they did better than before and got past the first stage in the tournament. They did even better in 2022, reaching the semifinals and earning a spot in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. This was the first time the national team took part in a FIFA Women's World Cup in their 42 years of history. In Southeast Asia, the Philippine women's team won their first AFF Women's Championship in 2022. Before, they didn't do as well in this championship and at the Southeast Asian Games. They only got third place in 1985 when only three teams played, and in 2021. Right now, in August 2023, the team is ranked 44th in the world in the women's FIFA ranking. This is their highest rank ever. == References == Category:National sports teams of the Philippines Category:Asian women's national football teams Category:Football in the Philippines",
