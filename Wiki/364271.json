 "text": "Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1st Baronet (8 August 1646 – 19 October 1723) was the leading portrait painter in England during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. He was court painter to English and British monarchs from Charles II to George I. His major works include The Chinese Convert (1687); a series of four portraits of Isaac Newton; a series of ten reigning European monarchs, including King Louis XIV of France; over 40 \"Kit-cat portraits\" of members of the Kit-Cat Club; and ten \"beauties\" of the court of William III. The beauties series was to match a similar series of ten beauties of the court of Charles II. The earlier portraits were painted by court painter before him, Sir Peter Lely. ==Selected works== Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|Isaac Newton (1689) Image:JohnLocke.png|Portrait of John Locke Image:King William III of England, (1650-1702).jpg|Portrait of King William III of England Image:Louis XIV By Sir Godfrey Kneller.jpg|Sketch of Louis XIV ==References== Category:1646 births Category:1723 deaths Category:English painters Category:People from Lübeck",
