 "text": "Gears are mechanical parts with cut teeth designed to fit with teeth on another part or gear so as to transmit or receive force and motion. Gears are also sometimes called toothed wheels or cogged wheels or cogs. The cut teeth are also sometimes called cogs. Numerous nonferrous alloys, cast irons, powder-metallurgy and even plastics are used in the manufacture of gears. However steels are most commonly used because of their high strength to weight ratio and high cost. == Related pages == *Transmission == Other websites == *Types Of Gears *Mathematical Tutorial for Gearing (Relating to Robotics) *Animation of an Involute Rack and Pinion *Gear Encyclopedia * Gears Category:Engineering",
