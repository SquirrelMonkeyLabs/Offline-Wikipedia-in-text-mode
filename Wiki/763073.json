 "text": "The Cu Chi Tunnels are a tunnel system used by the Viet Cong to attack Saigon nearby during the Vietnam War. Throughout the war, Viet Cong would live in tunnels. These tunnels were often deep enough to protect Viet Cong from American bombers. Many of these tunnels were too small for most American soldiers to go into comfortably. They would often have traps that could injure or kill enemy soldiers. Category:Tunnels Category:Buildings and structures in Vietnam Category:Vietnam War",
