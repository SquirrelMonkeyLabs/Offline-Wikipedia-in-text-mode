It was written in 551.Or slightly later, see Peter Heather, Goths and Romans 332-489, Oxford 1991, pp. 47-49 (year 552), Walter Goffart, The Narrators of Barbarian History, Princeton 1988, p. 98 (year 554). He made a summary of a larger work by Cassiodoriius called Libri XII De Rebus Gestis Gothorum (Twelve books about the things the Goths did, commonly known as Libri XII). As the Libri XII have not survived, his work is the only surviving account that was written when there were still Goths. According to the Getica, the Goths immigrated form Scandinavia and settled around what is the city Danzig today. This has been identified with the Wielbark culture. == References == == Other websites == * IORDANIS DE ORIGINE ACTIBUSQUE GETARUM * \"The Origin and Deeds of the Goths\", trans. Charles C.
