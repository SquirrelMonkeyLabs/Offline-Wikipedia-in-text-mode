 "text": "In boxing, the term heavyweight is used for a specific group of people based on weight. Usually a heavyweight is a boxer who weighs more than 200 lbs (91kg). Below 200 is cruiserweight. A few organizations classify differently. In the late 20th century boxing organizations created many divisions so that fighters could fight people of the same size. This allows making more champions thus more profit. Most divisions only separate each other by few lbs. Before the 1960s there were 8 divisions. The first heavyweight champion under modern rules was John L. Sullivan. Famous heavyweight champions have included Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Vitali Klitshko, Tyson Fury and Lennox Lewis.
