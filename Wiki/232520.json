 "text": "In some operating systems, the null device is a device file that ignores anything written to it but returns that the write worked. This device is called `/dev/null` on Unix and Unix-like systems, `NUL:` or `NUL` on CP/M and DOS (internally `\\DEV\\NUL`), `nul` on newer Windows systems (internally `\\Device\\Null` on Windows NT), `NIL:` on Amiga systems, and `NL:` on OpenVMS. In Windows Powershell, the equivalent is `$null`. It returns nothing to any process that reads from it, returning EOF immediately. In IBM DOS/360, OS/360 (MFT, MVT), OS/390 and z/OS operating systems, such files would be assigned in JCL to `DD DUMMY`. == References == Category:Unix",
