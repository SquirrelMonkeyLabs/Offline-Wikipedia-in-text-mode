He was born and raised in Chicago, but lived most of his life in Michigan. Manieerre's work been called \"surprising and prophetic\".Manierre Dawson: a pioneer. Illinois State Museum. During a tour of Europe in 1910, he started painting true abstract works. Back in America, he became convinced that he could not earn a living at art, and became a farmer. He was forgotten until a rediscovery in 1963. He may have been the first person to paint a completely abstract work. He was probably the earliest American abstract artist,But he was not the first American modernist painter: that honour belongs to Alfred Maurer. slightly ahead of Arthur Dove.Ploog, Randy J; Myra Bairstow, and Ani Boyajian 2011.

The Three Graces in association with Hollis Taggart Galleries, New York. == Early career == After working for a year with a firm of architects, he was granted a six-month leave-of-absence for an educational tour of Europe. He departed in mid-June 1910 for his only trip abroad. He made his way across England to France, south through Germany, across Switzerland to Italy, back north for a second stay in Paris, and around northern Germany before embarking from Bremerhaven in late- November. In Sienna, he met and exchanged ideas on painting with John Singer Sargent. During his return visit to Paris he attended a Saturday evening soirée at the apartment of Gertrude Stein and he saw paintings by Paul Cézanne in the gallery of Ambroise Vollard. 1911 through 1914 were the most productive years of his career. In 1914, Dawson participated in two group exhibitions. Summers spent at the family’s retreat in Mason Country, Michigan were his most productive periods during his early career and provided rudimentary knowledge of growing and marketing fruit. He met Lilian Boucher, the daughter of a local farmer, and fell in love. They married in July 1915 and three children were born over the next five years. == Later career == Living in rural Michigan and struggling financially he made art from what was available (Portland cement, scraps of lumber, pieces of plywood). Sheets of composite wood (brand names Novoply and Timblend) were laminated together for thickness and carved into freestanding sculptures. The first real recognition of his work began in 1966 with a retrospective exhibition mounted by the Grand Rapids Art Museum. An exhibition organized by the John and Mable Ringing Museum in Sarasota and shared with the Norton Gallery in West Palm Springs followed a year later. This exhibition brought Dawson to the attention of Robert Schoelkopf, who showed his work in New York in April 1969 and March 1981. When Dawson was diagnosed with cancer in 1968, he sold the Michigan farm and moved to Sarasota permanently. He died on August 15, 1969. == Major paintings == * Prognostic, 1910, Milwaukee Museum of Art * Xdx, 1910, Brooklyn Museum of Art * Discal Procession, 1910, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC * Lucrece, 1911, The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota * Mrs. Darrow, 1911, Art Institute of Chicago * Meeting (The Three Graces), 1912, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York * Retrospect, 1913, The Museum of Modern Art, New York * Letters and Numbers, 1914, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC * Figure by Window, 1915, Illinois State Museum, Springfield == Bibliography == * Gedo, Mary M. 1977.
