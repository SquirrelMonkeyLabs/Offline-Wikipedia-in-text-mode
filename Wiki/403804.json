 "text": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem is a theorem that connects the geometry of a shape with its topology. It is named after the two mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gau√ü (1777-1855) and Pierre Ossian Bonnet (1812-1872) who both found it, independently of one another. The Curvature of the shape is used, as well as its Euler characteristic. Category:Mathematical theorems Category:Differential geometry Category:Topology",
