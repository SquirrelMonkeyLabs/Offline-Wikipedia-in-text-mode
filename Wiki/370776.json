 "text": "Harold \"Mush\" March (18 October 1908 â€“ 9 January 2002) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player that played 17 seasons in the NHL for the Chicago Black Hawks. March was best known for scoring the game-winning second overtime goal in Game 4 of the 1934 Stanley Cup Finals to win the Stanley Cup for the Chicago Black Hawks. He was also the first recorded player to win the Stanley Cup on an overtime goal. March won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Black Hawks again in 1938. He scored the very first goal in Maple Leaf Gardens on November 12, 1931 and also dropped the very same puck that he used to score the first goal during the ceremonial opening faceoff as part of the final game played at the Gardens. March was the last surviving member of Black Hawks 1934 Stanley Cup team. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1908 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Ice hockey people from Saskatchewan Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Canadian ice hockey right wingers Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Memorial Cup winners",
