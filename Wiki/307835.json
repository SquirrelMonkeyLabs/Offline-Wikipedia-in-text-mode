 "text": "The is a handheld game console made by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the replacement model to the PlayStation Portable. It was released in Japan on December 17, 2011. It was released in Europe, North America, South America and Singapore on February 22, 2012. It was released in Australia on February 23, 2012. It competed with the Nintendo 3DS. It is part of the eighth generation of gaming. ==Discontinuation== It was discontinued on Amazon on October 12, 2017 and worldwide on March 1, 2019. ==PlayStation 4 Connection== All games made for the PlayStation 4, with the exception of games requiring the use of special devices such as PlayStation Camera, are playable on the Vita through Remote Play. With the use of a Vita, PS4, and PS4 game, this allows a PS4 game to be run on the PS4, but its screen sent to the Vita, with the Vita being used for the controller, and the image and sound being sent to the Vita's screen and speakers instead of a television. The end result is similar to what a Wii U console does with its GamePad controller through Off-TV Play. The Vita technically has Remote Play functionality with the PlayStation 3 as well, though very few PS3 games supported the featur due to limitations with the less-powerful PS3 hardware. More PS3 games are available for streaming on the Vita through Sony's cloud gaming service PlayStation Now, though they are streamed over the internet in the form of cloud computing rather than directly from a physical PS3 console. First added in 2014, the service was announced to be removed from the Vita on August 15, 2017. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Sony Category:PlayStation (brand) Category:Sony consoles",
