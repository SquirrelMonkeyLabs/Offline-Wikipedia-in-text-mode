 "text": "The Volkswagen emissions scandal, sometimes called Dieselgate or Emissionsgate, started in September 2015 and involves the car brand Volkswagen. The United States Environmental Protection Agency found a program which was intentionally put in Volkswagen vehicles that made their Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) engines to activate emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing, which caused the vehicle to meet US standards only during testing. The vehicles ended up emitting 40 times more emissions in real world driving conditions than in the lab. This caused Volkswagen (and its sub-brands such as Audi and Skoda), to recall 11 million cars altogether worldwide which were produced within the years of 2009-2015. == References == == Other websites == * EPA Notice of Violation * State of California EPA In-Use Compliance Letter * Written Testimony of Michael Horn, CEO of Volkswagen Group of America Before the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 8 October 2015 * Analysis of the emission scandal from a procedural, organizational and technical level: The exhaust emissions scandal (\"Dieselgate\"), talk at 2015 Chaos Communication Congress. * U.S. v.
