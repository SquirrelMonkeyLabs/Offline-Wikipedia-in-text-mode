One of only three hospitals in Lanarkshire is in Wishaw. Wishaw General Hospital is at the bottom of Wishaw, easy to find as it is on the main A721 road. == History == The origin of the name is uncertain. One suggestion is that it is from the Scots word for \"Wicket gate in the wood\", and that it used to be called Wygateshaw. Another theory is that it was originally Viashaw, meaning way or road through the wood. Yet another theory is that the name derives from \"Wee Shaw\", meaning small wood. In November 1996, the world's worst recorded outbreak of E. coli occurred in the town, in which 20 people died and around 200 were infected.The Guardian == People == Wishaw has had a number of famous residents, including: *John Higgins, world snooker champion *Paul Quinn, footballer for Motherwell F.C. *Tommy Gemmell, former footballer of Celtic F.C. *Lee Miller, footballer for Aberdeen F.C. == References == == Other websites == * Census 2001 statistics for Wishaw * History and Photographs of Wishaw Iron & Steel Works 1859 - 1930 * Website of the local Newspaper, the Wishaw Press Category:Towns in North Lanarkshire",
