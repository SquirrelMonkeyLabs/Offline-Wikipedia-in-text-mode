 "text": "The Sao Paulo leaf frog (Phyllomedusa distincta) is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 1000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that have grown back. People have seen it on shrubs near water that does not flow. The female frog lays eggs on leaves that are over water that does not dry up. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water below. Scientists do not believe that this frog is in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in such a large place. But there are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frogs live to build towns and cities, make small farms, make tree farms, and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
