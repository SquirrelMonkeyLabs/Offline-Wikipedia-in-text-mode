 "text": "A nian ( 年獸) is a mythological creature from the Chinese mythology. According to Chinese legend, a fierce beast called Nian terrorized villages on the last day of the lunar year. Villagers fled to the mountains each year to escape it, until an old man promised to drive it away. On that night, the old man used firecrackers and red clothing to scare Nian off, revealing himself as a celestial being. The villagers then adopted customs like hanging red decorations and setting off firecrackers, leading to the celebration of Lunar New Year’s Eve. ==References== Category:Legendary creatures Category:Chinese mythology",
