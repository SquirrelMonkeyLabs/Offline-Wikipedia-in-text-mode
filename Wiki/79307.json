 "text": "Jura is a department in the east of France in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region. It is named after the Jura mountains. The largest city in the department is Dole but its prefecture (capital) is the city of Lons-le- Saunier. == History == Historically, Jura belonged to the Free County of Burgundy, known in French as the Franche-Comté. Dole was the capital until the region was conquered by Louis XIV. Louis XIV moved the capital to Besançon and Dole is now a sous-préfecture of Jura. As early as the 13th century, inhabitants of the southern 2/3 of Jura spoke a dialect of Arpitan language. It continued to be spoken in rural areas into the 20th century. Jura is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790. It was created from part of the former province of Free County. The department was created with six districts: Dole, Lons-le-Saunier, Orgelet, Poligny, Saint-Claude and Salins; the capital was Lons-le-Saunier alternating with Dole, Poligny and Salins but from 1794 only Lons-le-Saunier remained as the capital. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the six districts were changed into four arrondissements: Lons-le-Saunier, Dole, Poligny and Saint-Claude. On 10 September 1926, the arrondissement of Poligny was eliminated. == Geography == Jura is part of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region. It has an area of .
