 "text": "The 2024 United Kingdom general election was held on 4 July 2024. It determined the composition of the House of Commons, which determines the next Government of the United Kingdom. In addition, this was the first UK general election where physical forms of voter identification were needed to vote in Great Britain. The Labour Party won with a landslide majority, leading to Keir Starmer replacing Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister. The Conservative Party lost 244 seats, giving them their lowest number of seats (121) in the party's history. == Background == Boris Johnson, the Conservatives leader, had won the last election in a landslide. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, resigned and was replaced by Keir Starmer. Shortly after winning the election, Johnson passed the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Around the same time cases of Covid-19 started happening in the UK. Whilst Johnson and the Conservatives stayed ahead in the polls for most of 2020-2021, at the end of 2021 stories about parties in Downing Street during lockdown started appearing in the news (Partygate). Johnson's popularity suffered, and he was forced to resign later that year due to the Chris Pincher scandal. Johnson was replaced as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister by Liz Truss in September 2022. Truss made huge unfunded tax cuts which caused economic problems, and was forced to resign after just 50 days. She was replaced by Rishi Sunak. When Sunak took over, the Conservatives were now far behind Labour in the polls. In May 2024 he called for an election to be held on 4 July of that year. == Results == 2024 Brtish general election Party Seats Leader/Leaders Labour Party 411 seats Keir Starmer Conservative Party 121 seats Rishi Sunak Liberal Democrats 72 seats Ed Davey Scottish National Party 9 seats John Swinney Sinn Féin 7 seats Mary Lou McDonald Reform UK 5 seats Nigel Farage Democratic Unionist Party 5 seats Gavin Robinson Green Party of England and Wales 4 seats Carla Denyer Adrian Ramsay Plaid Cymru 4 seats Rhun ap Iowerth Social Democratic and Labour Party 2 seats Colum Eastwood Alliance Party of Northern Ireland 1 seat Naomi Long Ulster Unionist Party 1 seat Doug Beattie Traditional Unionist Voice 1 seat Jim Allister Speaker 1 seat Lindsay Hoyle Sinn Féin's MPs do not go to the UK Parliament to take their seats because of the party's policy on not doing so. ==Notes== ==References== Category:United Kingdom general elections Category:2024 elections in Europe Category:2024 in the United Kingdom Category:July 2024 events",
