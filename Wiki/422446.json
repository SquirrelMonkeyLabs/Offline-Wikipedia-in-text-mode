 "text": "Logorrhea is a speech disorder. It is a psychological disorder where a person speaks continuously in gibberish. It is a sign of an underlying mental illness, which needs psychiatric attention. ==Overview== Logorrhea happens in many different psychiatric and neurological conditions. Some of these are glossolalia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. The word sometimes refers to someone who is talkative. This is meant as a funny joke. ==Popular culture== The dramatic monologue Not I by Samuel Beckett is an example of logorrhea. So is Lucky's speech in the play Waiting for Godot. In E.W. Scripps' National Spelling Bee (1999), the spelling bee champion Nupur Lala won with the word logorrhea. Then, a documentary, Spellbound, was made about the spelling bee. ==Related pages== * Word salad Category:Disorders Category:Mental illnesses Category:Communication",
