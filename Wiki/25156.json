 "text": "Macedonia (Greek: Μακεδονία) or Macedon was an Ancient Greek kingdom of the Archaic and Classical Greece,. and later the most powerful state of Hellenistic Greece.. The kingdom was established and was at first ruled by the royal Argead dynasty, which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties. Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula,. and bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. Alexander the Great made it the most powerful kingdom in the Near East for a few years. When he died the empire fell apart and the Antigonid dynasty ruled Macedonia as a small empire. Centuries later the Roman Empire conquered Macedonia and much of Alexander's empire. == Kings == === Argead dynasty === * Karanus 808-778 BC * Koinos * Tyrimmas * Perdiccas I 700-678 BC * Argaeus I 678-640 BC * Philip I 640-602 BC * Aeropus I 602-576 BC * Alcetas I 576-547 BC * Amyntas I 547-498 BC * Alexander I 498-454 BC * Perdiccas II 454-413 BC * Archelaus 413-399 BC * Craterus 399 BC * Orestes 399-396 BC * Archelaus II 396-393 BC * Amyntus II 393 BC * Pausanias 393 BC * Amyntas III 393 BC * Argaeus II 393-392 BC * Amyntas III (restored) 392-370 BC * Alexander II 370-368 BC * Ptolemy I 368-365 BC * Perdiccas III 365-359 BC * Amyntas IV 359-356 BC * Philip II 359-336 BC * Alexander III (the Great) 336-323 BC ** Antipater, Regent of Macedon 334-319 BC * Philip III Arrhidaeus 323-317 BC * Alexander IV 323-310 BC ** Perdiccas, Regent of Macedon 323-321 BC ** Antipater, Regent of Macedon 321-319 BC ** Polyperchon, Regent of Macedon 319-317 BC ** Cassander, Regent of Macedon 317-306 BC === Antipatrid dynasty === * Cassander 306-297 BC * Philip IV 297-296 BC * Alexander V 296-294 BC * Antipater II 296-294 BC === Antigonid dynasty === * Demetrius I Poliorcetes 294-288 BC * Lysimachus (divided with Pyrrhus of Epirus) 288-281 BC * Pyrrhus of Epirus (divided with Lysimachus) 288-285 BC * Ptolemy II Ceraunus 281-279 BC * Meleager 279 BC * Antipater II Etesias 279 BC * Sosthenes (Army Commander) 279-277 BC * Antigonus II Gonatas 277-274 BC * Pyrrhus of Epirus (restored) 274-272 BC * Antigonus II Gonatas (restored) 272-239 BC * Demetrius II Aetolicus 239-229 BC * Antigonus III Doson 229-221 BC * Philip V 221-179 BC * Perseus 179-168 BC * == References == == Books == * Eugene N.
