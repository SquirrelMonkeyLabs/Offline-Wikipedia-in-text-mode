 "text": "Douglas Wagner Bentley (September 3, 1916 – November 24 1972) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger who played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers. Bentley missed the entire 1944–45 NHL season after being given permission to stay home and tend the family farm by Canadian Armed Forces officials, September, 1944. From 1940 to 1947, his brother Max Bentley was his teammate and linemate in Chicago. Both brothers have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and in 1998, both brothers were named to The Hockey News' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, Max at number 48 and Doug at number 73. On March 13, 1966 in an Eastern Hockey League game vs Jacksonville, Doug Bentley inserted his son, Doug Jr. (b. June 1, 1951) into the game when the team was short of players due to injuries. Doug Jr. was only 14 years of age at the time, becoming the youngest player to play a shift in a professional hockey league. ==Achievements and awards== *Art Ross Trophy (1943) *NHL First All-Star Team left wing (1943, 1944, 1947) *NHL Second All-Star Team centre (1949) *Voted by the Herald American as the top hockey player in Chicago for the first half of the century (1950) ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1938–39 Drumheller Miners ASHL ?? 24 29 53 31 — — — — — 1939–40 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 39 12 7 19 12 2 0 0 0 0 1940–41 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 46 8 20 28 12 5 1 1 2 4 1941–42 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 38 12 14 26 11 3 0 1 1 4 1942–43 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 50 33 40 73 18 — — — — — 1943–44 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 50 38 39 77 22 9 8 4 12 4 1945–46 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 36 19 21 40 16 4 0 2 2 0 1946–47 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 52 21 34 55 18 — — — — — 1947–48 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 60 20 37 57 16 — — — — — 1948–49 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 58 23 43 66 38 — — — — — 1949–50 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 64 20 33 53 28 — — — — — 1950–51 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 44 9 23 32 20 — — — — — 1951–52 Saskatoon Quakers PCHL 35 11 14 25 12 — — — — — 1951–52 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 8 2 3 5 4 — — — — — 1952–53 Saskatoon Quakers WHL 70 22 23 45 37 13 6 3 9 14 1953–54 Saskatoon Quakers WHL 42 8 13 21 18 — — — — — 1953–54 New York Rangers NHL 20 2 10 12 2 — — — — — 1954–55 Saskatoon Quakers WHL 61 14 23 37 52 — — — — — 1955–56 Saskatoon Quakers/Brandon Regals WHL 60 7 26 33 21 — — — — — 1957–58 Saskatoon Regals/St. Paul Saints WHL 19 11 16 27 0 — — — — — 1961–62 Los Angeles Blades WHL 8 0 2 2 2 — — — — — 1962–63 Long Beach Gulls CalHL — — — — — — — — — — NHL totals 565 219 324 543 217 23 9 8 17 12 ==Coaching statistics== Season Team League Type G W L T OTL Pct 1951–52 Saskatoon Quakers PCHL Head Coach + ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? .??? 1952–53 Saskatoon Quakers PCHL Head Coach 70 35 26 9 0 .564 1953–54 Saskatoon Quakers WHL Head Coach ++ ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? .??? 1954–55 Saskatoon Quakers WHL Head Coach 71 19 41 11 0 .345 1955–56 Saskatoon Quakers WHL Head Coach ++ ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? .??? 1958–59 Saskatoon Quakers SJHL Head Coach ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? .??? 1959–60 Saskatoon Quakers SJHL Head Coach ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? .??? 1962–63 Long Beach Gulls CalHL Head Coach ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? .??? 1965–66 Knoxville Knights EHL Head Coach 72 34 36 2 0 .486 1966–67 Knoxville Knights EHL Head Coach 72 27 42 3 0 .396 1967–68 Edmonton Nuggets WCSHL Co- Coach ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? .???
