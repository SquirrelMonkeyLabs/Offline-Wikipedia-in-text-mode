 "text": "The Chicago Strangler is the nickname given to an American serial killer (or killers). He is suspected of raping and killing at least 55 women in Southwestern Chicago between 2001 and 2018. The killings were not believed to be by the same person until 2018. Before that, they were considered to have been done by different people. Representatives of the Chicago Police Department told the media in 2019 that there may be more than one serial killer in the city. == Victims == The killer chose women between the ages of 18 and 58 as victims. They were mostly African-American. Most of the victims were prostitutes or members of a marginalized group who had previous problems with the justice system. Almost all of the victims were strangled. They were left in unused buildings, alleys, garbage bins, parks and snowdrifts. In November 2007, one person killed two women in two days. He put their bodies in garbage cans and then set them on fire. Most of the murders were done near Washington Park in Chicago's Southside and near Garfield Park in Western Chicago. Washington park is a high-crime area. . Category:American serial killers Category:Criminals from Chicago",
