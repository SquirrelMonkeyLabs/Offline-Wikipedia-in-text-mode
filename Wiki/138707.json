 "text": "A real-time operating system (RTOS; commonly pronounced as \"are-toss\") is a multitasking operating system designed for real-time applications. Such applications include embedded systems, industrial robots, scientific research equipment and others. An RTOS simplifies the creation of a real-time applications, but does not guarantee the final result will be real-time; this requires good development of the software. Real-time operating systems use specialized scheduling algorithms in order to provide the real-time applications. An RTOS can respond more quickly and/or predictably to an event than other operating systems. The main features of an RTOS are minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency. The basic two designs for RTOS are: * Event-driven (priority scheduling) designs: switch tasks only when an event of higher priority needs service, called pre-emptive priority. * Time-sharing designs: switch tasks on a clock interrupt, and on events, called round robin. == Examples == These are the best known, most widely used real-time operating systems. See List of real-time operating systems for a full list. Also, see List of operating systems for all types of operating systems. * Windows CE * QNX * RTLinux * VxWorks * TRON == Related pages == * Operating system * BIOS * Rate-monotonic scheduling * Adaptive Partition Scheduler * Earliest deadline first scheduling == Other websites == * SOOS Project Category:Operating systems",
