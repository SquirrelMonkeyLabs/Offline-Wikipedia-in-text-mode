 "text": "Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola GCFR, popularly known as M.K.O Abiola (August 24, 1937 - July 7, 1998), was a Nigerian businessman, publisher, and politician. He was presumed the winner of the June 1993 presidential election, but the election was cancelled by then military government of Nigeria; even though it seemed to be the country's most transparent election. When Abiola declared himself the winner, he was arrested and spent several years in jail; even until his death in 1998. By the time of his death, he had become an unexpected symbol of democracy. However, over two decades after his death, his widow Modupe Onitiri-Abiola seemed to have reduced Abiola's legacy \"when she broadcast a video of herself declaring the creation of a Democratic Republic of the Yoruba\". Modupe Onitiri-Abiola's secession declaration attracted several reactions, with her actions being called \"foolishness\", or \"delusion\". Other sources equally denounced Modupe Onitiri-Abiola, with the very act of declaring Yoruba independence being condemned as \"clueless\" and \"asinine\", with her character being equated with \"madness\", or being considered as \"a display of lunacy\". Not only did Nigerians criticize her for declaring independence for a sovereign Yoruba nation, but one of them also accused her of eroding the democratic legacy of her late husband. Based on what Modupe Onitiri-Abiola said in her 2007 book that \"Equation of being richly blessed and being poor does not match\", Isaiah Ogedegbe noted that Modupe's secession declaration seemed to have revived discussions about the socio-economic problems, and the rising divisions in Nigeria today. A former presidential spokesperson, Reuben Abati also noted that Modupe's secession declaration might be a result of the long-standing ethnic, socio-cultural challenges facing the country since 1966, which had witnessed the political interventions of some people like Isaac Adaka Boro, Kaduna Nzeogwu, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Gideon Orkar and, most recently, Nnamdi Kanu. According to him, Modupe's secession declaration also served as a reminder that \"the bigger issue that we have to deal with perhaps is the increasing, creeping failure of the Nigerian state\". ==References== Category:1937 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Nigerian politicians Category:Nigerian businesspeople Category:African philanthropists",
