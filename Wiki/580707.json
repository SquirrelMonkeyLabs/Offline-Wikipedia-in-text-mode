 "text": "The flag of the state of Delaware is of a buff-colored diamond on a field of colonial blue. The coat of arms of the state of Delaware are inside the diamond. Below the diamond is the date December 7, 1787. This is the day when Delaware became the first state to ratify the United States Constitution. The colors of the flag are the colors of the uniform of General George Washington. The coat of arms in the center of the flag was adopted on January 17, 1777. It shows a shield with green, blue, and white stripes on it. On the stripes are a sheaf of wheat, an ear of corn, and an ox standing on grass. All of these things are shown for Delaware's farming. Above the shield is a sailing ship. Supporting the shield are a farmer on the left and a soldier on the right. The state motto, below the shield, reads \"Liberty and Independence\". These symbols are also included on the seal of Delaware. The current flag was adopted on July 24, 1913. During the American Civil War, regiments from Delaware flew a flag which was similar to the state coat of arms on a field of blue. In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Delaware's flag 52nd in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked. ==References== Delaware Category:Delaware Category:Flags with coats of arms",
