The decision was made a day after the announcement of referendums on the accession of the DPR, LPR, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. With this, Putin escalated Russia's military efforts in the war with Ukraine. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russia had a \"huge mobilization reserve\" and planned to mobilize 300,000 in reserve. 38 Russian regions have announced that they had completed the mobilization. On 14 October 2022, Putin claimed that the partial mobilization would be completed “in about two weeks”. ==References== Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Category:September 2022 events",
