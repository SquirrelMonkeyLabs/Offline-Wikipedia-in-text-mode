It happens in a fake city in Scotland called Riverseafingal, which was filmed in North Berwick, Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Newcastle upon Tyne and Manchester. The school is in a round shape, and is Gourock Primary School, which is real and in Gourock. Me Too! was made by a production company in Glasgow named Tattiemoon. One of the series' directors was Andrew Agnew, who played PC Plum from Balamory, which used similar ideas. ==The series== There are six adults. All of them have children except Juno, who owns a dog. One of the adults takes them to Granny Murray's house. Granny Murray cares for them when the adult is gone to do their job. Sometimes, the parent thinks of them and a 'think puff' travels to Granny Murray's house and the scene changes to where they are, and the same happens with them to their parent. One thing the series was made to do was to show children who have childminders and working parents the parents are always thinking of them. Children also see a simpler version of an adult's day at work. Each episode is about a problem that happens at work and the main character's \"race against time\" to sort it out. Granny Murray gives the parent a piece of wisdom before they go, which helps to solve the problem. The series uses clocks and time a lot to help teach young children to tell the time. ==Main characters== A&E; means Accident & Emergency. ===Adults=== Character Job Actor Theme song Granny Murray childminder Jane McCarry Who's Here/What Have We Done Today?
