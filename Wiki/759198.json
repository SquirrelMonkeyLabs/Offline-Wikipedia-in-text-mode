Beginning on 11 March, Israel began enforcing social distancing and other rules to limit the spread of infection. Gatherings were first restricted to no more than 100 people, but on 15 March this was lowered to 10 people. On 19 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency.
