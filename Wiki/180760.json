 "text": "A mascot is any person, animal, or object thought to bring luck, or anything used to symbolize a group. Many schools and sports teams have a mascot, and so do some corporations or products. For example, the mascot of the Sacramento Kings is a lion, and the mascot of Geico is a gecko. Mascots can be used as spokespeople in advertising for products. They are also used in merchandise, which can be any kind of product that features the brand or can represent the mascot itself. == Other websites == Category:Brand management",
