 "text": "The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a state in Southeast and Central Europe which existed from 1918 until 1941. ==History== ===Background=== In 1903, King Alexander I of Serbia was murdered and replaced with Peter I of Serbia. After this, Serbia became more nationalist. Tensions with Austria-Hungary heightened when it conquered Bosnia in 1908. During this period Serbia managed to extend its borders and reconquer Kosovo and North Macedonia from the Ottoman Empire. Many Serbian nationalists wanted to create a unified state for the Slavs of the Balkans. Covert gangs attempted to assassinate Austro-Hungarian officials, like the Bosnian governor. In June 1914, a Bosnian Serb called Gavrilo Princip killed Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Bosnia. This event eventually led to World War I. ===Creation=== Yugoslavia came into existence in 1918 after World War I. Most of its northern territories were given to it from Austria-Hungary when it collapsed during the war. Its territories were reconquered by Serbia from the Ottoman Empire during the Balkan Wars (1912â€“13). The reigning king in Serbia became the king of all Yugoslavia. For ten years, it was known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It began using the name 'Yugoslavia' in 1929. The name 'Yugoslavia' is Serbo-Croatian for 'Land of the Southern Slavs'. The Kingdom was invaded by the Axis Powers in 1941 and quickly fell during World War II. A Federal Democratic Republic was declared in 1943 with the King's approval, but the monarchy was abolished shortly after. ==References== Category:World War II Category:History of Serbia Category:History of Croatia Category:History of Yugoslavia Category:1940s disestablishments Category:20th century in Slovenia Category:History of North Macedonia Category:Former monarchies of Europe Category:1918 establishments in Europe Category:20th century in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Former countries of the Interwar period Category:States and territories disestablished in the 20th century",
