 "text": "The Cadillac ELR is a luxury car made by Cadillac. It is a two-door, four-seat hybrid car. The ELR was sold in 2014 and 2016, but it was not sold in 2015. It is a plug-in hybrid, meaning it can be powered by electricity and also has a gasoline engine. The car shares its technology with the Chevrolet Volt, using the same electric system but with a more luxury design. The ELR can drive about 37 to 39 miles (60 to 63 kilometers) on electricity alone. == History == The Cadillac ELR was based on the Cadillac Converj concept car, which was shown in 2009. At first, GM did not plan to make the Converj, but in 2011 they decided to turn it into the ELR. The ELR was made to offer a luxury alternative to the Chevrolet Volt. It was first shown to the public in 2013. The car was produced at GMâ€™s factory in Detroit and went on sale in late 2013 in the United States and Canada. == Markets == The Cadillac ELR was sold only in the United States and Canada during its entire production. == Discontinuation == The production of the Cadillac ELR ended in February 2016, with only 2,958 cars built in total. The car was expensive, and GM decided to stop making it because it did not sell as well as expected. After the ELR, GM focused on other electric and hybrid cars. == References == Category:2010s automobiles ELR",
