 "text": "Naturopathy is a form of alternative medicine. It is based on the belief that a special energy called \"vital energy\" guides bodily functions like metabolism, reproduction and growth. Naturopaths use various forms of treatment, such as herbal medicine and massaging, with a holistic view. They generally avoid the use of surgery and synthetic drugs. In Naturopathy, evidence-based medicine is thought of as being only part of the evidence. Taken as a whole, naturopathy is an ideologic system, not a scientific one. The term naturopathy comes from Greek and Latin, meaning \"natural therapy\". Modern naturopathy developed from the Natural Cure movement in Europe. ==Related pages== * Osteopathy ==References== * *Council on Naturopathic Medical Education Category:Alternative medicine Category:Pseudoscience Category:Medical specialties",
