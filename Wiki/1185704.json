 "text": "William Brown (1761 â€“ 20 September 1793) was an Assistant gardener who became a Mutineer on the mutiny on the bounty. As assistant to Botanist David Nelson aboard the HMS Bounty, his duty was to help care for the 600 breadfruit plants Commander Wiliam Bligh was transporting from Tahiti to the West Indies. He was kept below deck during the mutiny on April 28, 1789, but afterwards chose to remain with lead mutineer Fletcher Christian. It was Brown who determined that Pitcairn Island had sufficient natural resources for the Bounty fugitives to settle there, and a natural well he discovered is still called \"Brown's Water\". On \"Massacre Day\", September 20, 1793, Brown, Christian, and three other mutineers were murdered in an uprising by Tahitian natives, who had been mistreated by some of the white men. ==References== Category:1761 births Category:1793 deaths Category:English sailors Category:Pitcairn Islands Category:Mutiny on the Bounty Category:HMS Bounty mutineers",
