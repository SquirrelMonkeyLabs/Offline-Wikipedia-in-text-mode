 "text": "\"Welfare queen\" is a slur used in the United States to call women who allegedly misuse or collect excessive welfare payments through fraud, child endangerment, or manipulation. Reporting on welfare fraud began during the early 1960s, appearing in general-interest magazines such as Readers Digest. The term \"welfare queen\" originates from media reporting in 1974 and again when Ronald Reagan used the term to describe Linda Taylor during his 1976 campaign. ==References== Category:Ronald Reagan Category:Pejoratives",
