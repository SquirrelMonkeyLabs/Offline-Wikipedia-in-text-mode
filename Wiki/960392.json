To enter the code, someone has to enter `↑``↑``↓``↓``←``→``←``→``B``A` (sometimes followed by `START` and/or `SELECT`). The code has also found a place in popular culture as a reference to the third generation of video game consoles and is present as an Easter egg on several websites. == References == Category:Konami games",
