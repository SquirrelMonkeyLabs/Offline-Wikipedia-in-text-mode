It was a territory governed by the League of Nations under the Treaty of VersaillesArticle 45-50 with Annex, Treaty of Versailles for 15 years from 1920. Its population in 1933 was 812,000, and its capital was Saarbrücken.Saarland in the page about Germany on WorldStatesmen.org It was made up of parts of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Palatinate of the Rhine. It was slightly smaller than the modern German state of Saarland.The extent of the territory is specified in Article 48, Treaty of Versailles ==Commission of Government== According to Treaty of Versailles the highly industrialized Saarland was to be governed by the League of Nations for a period of 15 years, and its coalfields given to France. The Commission of Government, which represented the League of Nations, had five members. At least one member had to be French and one a native of the Saar.Paragraph 16-17, Chapter II, Annex to Article 45-50, Treaty of Versailles At the end of the 15 year period, in 1935, the people of the Saar voted on how they wanted their country. They voted to become a part of Nazi Germany. It had a currency, the Saar franc, and its own postage stamps during this period. ===Chairmen of the Commission=== The League of Nations' control to the region was represented by the following Chairmen of the Commission of Government: * Victor Rault, France (26 February 1920 - 18 March 1926) * George Washington Stephens, Canada (18 March 1926 - 8 June 1927) * Sir Ernest Colville Collins Wilton, United Kingdom (8 June 1927 - 1 April 1932) * Sir Geoffrey George Knox, United Kingdom (1 April 1932 - 1 March 1935) ==Plebiscite== In 1933, many anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich's control. As a result, anti-Nazi groups wanted the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany. However, France had a lot of power in the Saar, including control of the coal mines. Not many Saarlanders liked France, and in the plebiscite on 13 January 1935, 90% of the voters wished to join Germany, and 8.86% wanted to stay with the League of Nations. Only 0.40% (that is, four voters in every thousand) wanted to join France. ==Nazi rule== On 17 January 1935, the territory's re-union with Germany was approved by the League Council. On 1 March, the Nazi Germany took over the region, and appointed Josef Bürckel as Reichskommissar für die Rückgliederung des Saarlandes, \"Reich Commissioner for the re-union of Saarland\". Many former politicians and office holders of the Saargebiet were changed or arrested by the Nazis. When re-incorporation was completed, the governor became Reichskommissar für das Saarland, \"Reich Commissioner of Saarland\" on 17 June 1936. ==Related pages== * Saarland The modern Land of Germany * Saar (protectorate), a protectorate under French control (1947-1956) * Sarre (département), a département of France (1798-1814) * Saar River * Nazi Germany * Free City of Danzig ==Notes== == Other websites == * Saarland in the page about Germany on WorldStatesmen.org * Part III - Political Clauses for Europe, Treaty of Versaille Category:States and territories established in the 20th century Category:1920 establishments in Europe Category:1920s establishments in Germany Category:League of Nations mandates Category:Saarland Category:States and territories disestablished in the 20th century Category:1930s disestablishments in Germany Category:1935 disestablishments in Europe",
