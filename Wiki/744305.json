 "text": "The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was a big football tournament for women's national teams from different countries. It was the ninth time that held this tournament. It happened every four years. This time, it took place from July 20 to August 20, 2023. Australia and New Zealand worked together to host it, which was the first time two countries did that. It was the first time that teams from different confederations will play together. Australia is part of the Asian Confederation, while New Zealand is in the Oceanian Confederation. Before, there were 24 teams, but this time they had 32 teams, just like the men's World Cup. The first game was between New Zealand and Norway on July 20, 2023. Spain became the champions by beating England 1-0 in the final match. It was Spain's first time winning this tournament, and they were really good. They were also the first European team to win since 2007. A player from Japan named Hinata Miyazawa scored the most goals, and a Spanish player named Aitana Bonmat√≠ was voted the best player. Another Spanish player, Salma Paralluelo, got an award for being a young and talented player. England's goalkeeper, Mary Earps, was the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The United States were the champions then as they won the last two tournaments in 2015 and 2019, but this time they got knocked out in an earlier round by Sweden. It was a big surprise because the United States team is usually really strong. Many people liked how New Zealand and Australia organized the tournament, and a lot of people went to watch the games. Some people even said it was the best Women's World Cup ever. == Host selection == Choosing where an event will take place is called host selection. For the FIFA Women's World Cup, it means deciding which country will hold the tournament. They look at things like the country's facilities and ability to handle a big event. The chosen country will be in charge of planning and running the tournament. For the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, countries had to submit their bids. At first, nine countries were interested, but some dropped out. Australia and New Zealand decided to join forces and submitted a joint bid. Brazil, Colombia, and Japan also submitted bids but later withdrew. In the end, Australia and New Zealand won the bid. This is the first time the Women's World Cup will be held in multiple countries. It's also the first time in the Southern Hemisphere and the first senior FIFA tournament in Oceania. Australia is the second country from the AFC to host the Women's World Cup. So, in 2023, the Women's World Cup will take place in Australia and New Zealand. 2023 FIFA WWC bidding Bidding Nation(s) Votes Votes Votes Votes Bidding Nation(s) Round 1 Australia & New Zealand 22 Colombia 13 Recused 2 Total votes 35 Majority required 18 == Teams == AFC (6) * (co-hosts) * * * (debut) * * (debut) CAF (4) * (debut) * * * (debut) CONCACAF (6) * * * (debut) * * (debut) * CONMEBOL (3) * * * OFC (1) * (co-hosts) UEFA (12) * * * * * * * * (debut) * (debut) * * * === Draw === Pot 1 Pot 2 Pot 3 Pot 4 (22) (co-hosts) (13) (co-hosts) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (11) (12) (14) (15) (17) (18) (21) (24) (27) (29) (34) (37) (43) (45) (53) (54) (76) (81) Play-off Group A winners Play-off Group B winners Play-off Group C winners == Venues == Australia New Zealand Sydney Brisbane Auckland Wellington Stadium Australia Sydney Football Stadium Lang Park Eden Park Wellington Regional Stadium Capacity: 83,500 Capacity: 42,512 Capacity: 52,263 Capacity: 48,276 Capacity: 39,000 Melbourne Perth Adelaide Dunedin Hamilton Melbourne Rectangular Stadium Perth Rectangular Stadium Hindmarsh Stadium Forsyth Barr Stadium Waikato Stadium Capacity: 30,052 Capacity: 22,225 Capacity: 16,500 (expanding to 18,435) Capacity: 28,744 Capacity: 25,111 == Group stage == === Group A === \\---- \\---- === Group B === \\---- \\---- === Group C === \\---- \\---- === Group D === \\---- \\---- === Group E === \\---- \\---- === Group F === \\---- \\---- === Group G === \\---- \\---- === Group H === \\---- \\---- == Knockout stage == In the knockout stage, if a match is level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, extra time will be played (two periods of 15 minutes each).
