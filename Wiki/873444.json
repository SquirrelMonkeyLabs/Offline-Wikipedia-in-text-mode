It is the largest non-government Afghan women's rights organization in the world. It is dedicated to protecting the rights of Afghan women and girls. The staff are mostly Afghans. WAW adopts a community-based approach. For example, they give workshops about women's rights according to Islamic law. WAW opened what it called family guidance centers: there, women can ask for help, if they have problems at home. They also get counseling, for example, if the women are the victims of domestic violence. If there is a danger to the health or the life of the woman, the woman is sent to a women's shelter. In the shelters, women can talk to layers who help them fight for their rights. They can also get teaching in different skills. When these services are not enough, WAW also helps the women get a divorce. As well as the women, their children can also get a basic education in these centers.
