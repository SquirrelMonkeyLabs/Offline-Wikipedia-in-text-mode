 "text": "In physics, Wave absorption is the transfer of energy from a wave to a medium. A medium is a solid, liquid, or gas. Wave absorption occurs when a wave such as a sound or light hits a medium or object and travels through the medium. The wave then transfers its energy to the object. ==Related pages== *Absorption spectroscopy *Albedo *Attenuation *Electromagnetic absorption by water *Hydroxyl ion absorption *Optoelectronics *Photoelectric effect *Photosynthesis *Solar cell *Spectral line *Total absorption spectroscopy *Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy Category:Electromagnetic radiation Category:Spectroscopy",
