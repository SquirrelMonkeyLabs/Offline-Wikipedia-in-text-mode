 "text": "The 1959 Coatzacoalcos earthquake, also known as Jáltipan earthquake, hit at 02:25 local time on 26 August 1959, in Veracruz, Mexico. A magnitude of 6.4 was given at a depth of , and had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity was VIII (Severe). The epicenter of this earthquake was right off the coast of Coatzacoalcos in the Gulf of Mexico. It caused damage to several cities, including Acayucan, Coatzacoalcos, Jáltipan, and Minatitlán. 25 peoples died of the earthquake, and around 200 people were injured. This area doesn't usually have big earthquakes. Most of Mexico's earthquakes happen along the Middle America Trench on the southwest coast. But sometimes, on the eastern side near the Gulf of Mexico, there are earthquakes, although they're not as common as in places closer to Veracruz. These earthquakes in the Gulf area happen because of pressure from the Earth's plates pushing against each other due to a process called subduction. == References == Category:Earthquakes in Mexico Category:1959 in North America Category:1950s in Mexico",
