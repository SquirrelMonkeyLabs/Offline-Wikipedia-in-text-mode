 "text": "Phantasmarana is a group of frogs in the family Hylodidae. These frogs live in Brazil, in the Atlantic Forest. These frogs live in fast-flowing rivers. Scientists can't catch them easily. They jump into the water. These frogs have long, fanglike teeth. This might be because they eat small animals with bones as well as insects and other animals without bones. The tadpoles swim in the water. Phantasmarana are large frogs. Adults can be as long as from nose to rear end. The genus has the name Phantasmarana (\"phantom frog\") because the wild frogs are so rare and hard to catch. It also has this name because the frogs do not sing or call with their voices. Instead, they make strange noises. Members of Phantasmarana were formerly placed in Megaelosia. Phantasmarana is thought to be the sister genus to Hylodes. == Species == There are eight species: == References == Category:Frogs of South America",
