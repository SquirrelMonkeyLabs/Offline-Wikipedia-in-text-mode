 "text": "The Atacama skeleton (died late 1970's), commonly named Ata, was the skeletonized body probably belonging to a unborn infant found in 2003 in the ghost town of La Norie, Chile. The infant had died more than 20 years prior to it's discovery in 2003. The body had a unusual short size, shape, and height, and was once thought to have belonged to a extraterrestrial. DNA analysis done on the body in 2018 found there were unusual mutations on the body. The height of the skeleton was only 6 inches (15 cm). The remains were discovered by Oscar Munoz, who later sold them to another owner. The current owner now is Ram√≥n Navia-Osorio, a Spanish businessman.
