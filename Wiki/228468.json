 "text": "The pōhutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa), also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree, New Zealand Christmas bush, and iron tree, is a tree native to New Zealand. It grows mainly on the coast of the North Island. It is evergreen and has bright red flowers. These flowers appear between November and January, during the Southern hemisphere summer. It is red and green during Christmas. The Pōhutukawa is endangered, meaning that there are not many left. This is because possums eat the leaves of the trees, killing them. Project Crimson is a group trying to stop this happening. Category:Myrtaceae Category:Trees",
