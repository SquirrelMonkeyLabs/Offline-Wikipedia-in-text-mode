At the start of the Civil War, Custer was a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and his class's graduation was accelerated so that they could enter the war. Custer graduated last in his class and served at the First Battle of Bull Run as a staff officer for Major General George B. McClellan in the Army of the Potomac's 1862 Peninsula Campaign. Early in the Gettysburg Campaign, Custer's association with cavalry commander Major General Alfred Pleasonton earned him a brevet promotion from First Lieutenant to Brigadier General of United States Volunteers at the age of 23. Custer remained in the Army after the Civil War and served as an officer in the Indian Wars. He died with all this men in the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876. == Other websites == * Custer Battlefield Museum * Little Bighorn History Alliance * Custerwest.org:Site For Traditional Scholarship * Kenneth M Hammer Collection on Custer and the Battle of the Little Big Horn, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater == References == Category:American Civil War generals Category:Military people from Ohio Category:1839 births Category:1876 deaths",
