 "text": "The Division of Werriwa is a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales. The name Werriwa is the local Aboriginal name for Lake George. The lake was in the division when the boundaries were drawn in 1900. The division was one of the original 75 divisions for Australia's first federal election in 1901. It covered a large rural area from the south west of Sydney to the northern part of what is now the ACT. Over the years, the population around Sydney increased. The boundaries were redrawn and Werriwa became smaller in area. By 1913 Lake George was no longer included in the Dvision. Werriwa become a south-western Sydney suburban electorate over 150 km away from Lake George. It has kept the name of Werriwa, because it is an original Federation electorate. The Australian Electoral Commission tries to keep the names of original Federation electorates. Werriwa now covers the suburbs of Austral, Bardia, Bow Bowing, Casula, Claymore, Denham Court, Edmondson Park, Eschol Park, Glenfield, Horningsea Park, Hoxton Park, Ingleburn, Leppington, Lurnea, Macquarie Fields, Minto, Minto Heights, Prestons, Raby, St Andrews and Varroville and parts of Liverpool, Leumeah and West Hoxton. ==Members== Member Party Term Alfred Conroy Free Trade 1901–1906 David Hall Labor 1906–1912 Benjamin Bennett Labor 1912–1913 Alfred Conroy Commonwealth Liberal 1913–1914 John Lynch Labor 1914–1916 National Labor 1916–1917 Nationalist 1917–1918 Hubert Lazzarini Labor 1919-1931 Lang Labor 1931–1931 Walter McNicoll Country 1931–1934 Hubert Lazzarini Lang Labor 1934–1936 Labor 1936–1952 Gough Whitlam Labor 1952–1978 John Kerin Labor 1978–1994 Mark Latham Labor 1994–2005 Chris Hayes Labor 2005–2010 Laurie Ferguson Labor 2010–present It is a very safe seat for the Australian Labor Party (ALP), which has held it without a break since 1934.
