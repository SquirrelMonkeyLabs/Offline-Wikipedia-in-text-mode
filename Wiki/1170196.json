 "text": "The Colegio de San Juan de Letran is a private Catholic co-educational basic and higher education institution owned and run by the friars of the Order of Preachers in Intramuros, Manila, Philippines, founded in 1620. Colegio de San Juan de Letran has the distinction of being the oldest college in the Philippines and the oldest secondary institution in Asia. The school has produced Philippine legislators, poets, members of the clergy, jurists, heroes including the Philippine national hero, José Rizal — and it is also one of Philippine schools that cultivated Catholic saints who lived and studied in its campus. Letran's patron saint is St. John the Baptist. The campus has two notable statues, representing the two foremost alumni in the fields of secular and religious service: former Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon and the Vietnamese Roman Catholic Saint, Vicente Liem de la Paz. ==Gallery== File:San-Juan-de-Letran.jpg|Main entrance (ca. 1880) File:Aerial view of Letran College in Intramuros.jpg|Letran from the air File:Letran Admin.jpg|historical facade of Letran ==Other websites== *Letran—Intramuros *Letran—Calamba ==References== Category:Colleges and universities in Manila",
