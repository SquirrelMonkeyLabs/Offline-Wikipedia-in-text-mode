On 25 February, Russia threatened Finland and Sweden with \"military and political consequences\" if they tried to join NATO. After the invasion, Marin said that talks of Finland joining NATO had changed while also saying that there would have to be strong support in the country for them to join. In March 2022, she said the European Union needed to stop using Russian oil while supporting tough economic sanctions against Russia. That same month, Marin said Finland could support sending F/A-18 Hornets to Ukraine if other countries thought it would be a good idea.

She met with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to talk about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and climate change. ===NATO membership=== Early in her career, Marin was against the idea of Finland joining NATO. However, her feelings and thoughts about NATO changed when she became prime minister. In 2022, in response to Russian activities at the Ukrainian border, Marin said that Finland had the right to join NATO if it wanted to. Marin's speech was not liked by the Russian media. On 12 May 2022, ten weeks after the beginning of the invasion, President Niinistö and Prime Minister Marin said that \"Finland must apply for NATO membership\" and that it \"would strengthen Finland's security\". On 15 May 2022, Niinistö and Marin announced that Finland would apply to be a NATO member, and on 17 May the Finnish parliament approved the plan in a vote of 188–8.

Marin and her family had used around €14,363.20 on food services in the Prime Minister's official home between January 2020 and May 2021, which was about €845 per month. Marin said that she did not know the limit of the spending, and she also did not know that residential benefits had to be seen on taxes. It was later discovered that staff members were in charge of the spending and Marin had no idea of the costs. Marin later repaid her family's meal services to the Finnish state. With the controversy over spending on groceries, Marin had to say that public money was not spent on her wedding. The Office of the Chancellor of Justice found that Marin did nothing illegal. ===Leaked nightclub videos=== In early December 2021, Marin went celebrating in a nightclub in Helsinki hours after meeting with Finland's foreign minister who had tested positive for COVID-19, making her exposed to the disease. Two text messages were sent to Marin's government phone saying that she should be quarantined. However, Marin missed the messages because she was not carrying the phone at the time. As part of government rules, the Prime Minister should always have the governmental phone on them. She later said that she was sorry on Facebook and that she had been told that going out in public was okay because she was vaccinated. Two complaints about Marin's actions were sent to the Chancellor of Justice. Important members of the coalition party Centre Party said that Marin had lied to them by changing her reasoning of going out. In August 2022, another video showed Marin dancing at another party, which caused controversy because people thought Marin was on drugs while dancing at the party. Marin took a drug test on her own to prove she was not on drugs and on 22 August, the results of the test came out negative for drugs in her system. === Sámi rights legislation === In October 2022, Marin said she was sorry to the Indigenous Sámi people for how long it was taking to reform the Sámi human rights legislation. It was taking many years for it to pass in the parliament without any success. In Marin's cabinet, it was blocked by the Centre Party. Marin said that she would bring the reform for a parliamentary vote even without Centre Party support. In November 2022, her ministers voted 11–3 to send the legislation to the Finnish Parliament. On 24 February 2023, the constitutional law committee voted 9–7 to stop work on the bill, blocking it from being passed before the 2023 Finnish parliamentary election. In an interview on Ykkösaamu, Marin said she was not happy about the bill not being passed. ===2023 election and resignation=== In March 2023, the SDP finished third in the 2023 parliamentary election, and accepted her loss. However, Marin was re-elected with a Pirkanmaa district record of 35,623 votes. On 5 April 2023, Marin announced that she would resign as the leader of the Social Democratic Party at the next party congress in the autumn. She was replaced by Antti Lindtman on 1 September 2023.

Other members of the committee include former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
