 "text": "The Shocker (Herman Schultz) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr., and debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #46 in March 1967. He is mainly an antagonist in the Spider-Man comic book series. == Publication history == He was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr., and debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #46 in March 1967. == Fictional character biography == Schultz was originally a self-taught engineer and renowned safe cracker who invented a pair of gauntlets capable of producing powerful vibrational shock waves. He incorporated these gauntlets into a protective battlesuit and became a mercenary for hire. As the Shocker, Schultz quickly rose in New York City's criminal underworld and has been employed by various crime lords, which has often put him into conflict with Spider-Man. One notable trait that differentiates the Shocker from most other Spider-Man villains is his pursuit of wealth and a comfortable life rather than revenge or chaos. As a result, he has sometimes put aside his differences with Spider-Man and has helped him or other heroes when it was in his best interest. He is a member of the supervillain group, the Sinister Six. == In other media == The character has been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, having been voiced by Jim Cummings in Spider-Man: The Animated Series, Jeff Bennett in The Spectacular Spider-Man, and David B. Mitchell in the video game Spider-Man. Two iterations of the character were featured in the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe movie Spider-Man: Homecoming, with Herman Schultz portrayed by Bokeem Woodbine and Jackson Price portrayed by Logan Marshall-Green.
