 "text": "The Advanced Photo System, also known by its numerical label 240 or IX240, or by trademarked names such as Advantix, was a technology for photographic film and cameras. People started using it in the year 1996. This is what it did: * It had a new way of changing film in cameras, simpler than with the old roll film system, so the film could be \"dropped in\", just like people changed batteries. * It allowed for people to change a film, even if the entire film had not been used yet. * When the film was developed, it had an \"index print\" which showed small copies of every picture. This is similar to the contact sheets used with other film formats. * For each photo taken, special information was saved onto the film, called \"metadata\". * The developed negatives were stored in the original cartridge, unlike other film formats where they were kept in plastic sleeves. * There were three different kinds of images, which were made by cropping (cutting) the negative. The camera always started with the largest kind, but the finished picture could change depending on which aspect ratio the owner wanted. ** Panoramic ** Classic ** HDTV (16:9). The system also had problems: * Film frame size is smaller (30x16mm compared to 24x36 for older cameras). * The final print is not as good * Photography companies needed to buy new equipment, since their old equipment would not work with APS. * APS film processing was difficult at home. The Paterson developing tank, used at home with other film formats, never supported APS. * Reversal (slide) film was not available in APS format.

Since then, most cameras have switched to digital (electronic) systems anyway. Almost all remaining film cameras on the market use 135 film instead. One famous type of camera that used this system was the Canon IXUS, which then later changed and became a digital one. Many modern digital cameras use a sensor that is the same size as the APS-C frame. ==Technical details== The film comes in a canister similar to the 135 film cartridge, but smaller. The film is threaded onto the takeup reel automatically by the camera. This reduces the chance of mistakes during film loading, including mistakes that could damage the shutter. In addition to recording the image, the camera also records metadata such as the date and time the photo was taken, the aperture and shutter speed, and the size of the photo. Metadata can be recorded optically next to the picture area, or on a magnetic stripe that is built-into the film. All APS film (even black and white film) is developed in C-41 chemistry. After the film is developed, it is typically stored in the original cartridge, rather than plastic sleeves. ==Other websites== * photo.net - Reviews and comments on APS Category:Photography Category:Photographic film formats",
