 "text": "Jennifer Marcella Pe침a (born September 17, 1983 in Corpus Christi, Texas) is a Tejano/Latin pop singer. At age 12, she sang at the Houston Astrodome as a tribute to Selena. Signed by EMI, Pe침a's first album was nominated for a Tejano Music Award, and after her second album, she appeared on the soundtrack of Selena and was nominated for a Grammy Award. She has since released two more albums, most recently Seducci칩n, both of which have been successful. Pena's former boyfriend, also a singer, was involved in an argument with singer Obie Bermudez after a multiple artist concert in Texas during the summer of 2004; the argument was apparently started by jealousy from her ex- boyfriend towards Bermudez. During September of that year, Pena openly admitted to a magazine that she and the famous Puerto Rican rapper Bermudez have been having a serious relationship. ==References== Category:singers from Texas Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Latin singers Category:People from Corpus Christi, Texas Category:Tejano musicians",
