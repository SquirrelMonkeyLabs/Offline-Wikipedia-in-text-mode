The US and its allies forced the Taliban and Al-Qaeda to hide in the mountains. In December 2001, the US and its allies founded a new government for Afghanistan. Its president was Hamid Karzai. By February 2002, 5,000 soldiers from ISAF (or International Security Assistance Force) were in Afghanistan.ISAF in Afghanistan CDI, Terrorism Project – 14 February 2002. That military force was led by United States. ISAF's soldiers were on loan from the militaries of NATO countries and allied countries. In 2012 ISAF was at its maximum: 130,000 soldiers (in Afghanistan). In 2004 Hamid Karzai started as the first president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Even though the Taliban had lost power, they formed a \"shadow government\". Taliban insurgents, or fighters, controlled many parts of Afghanistan, and enforced their own laws. Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan, May 2011. British troops left Afghanistan in 2015, after 5 years of training the Afghanistan police to deal with threats from the Taliban. After security deteriorated, American soldiers returned and over 10,000 were in the country at the end of 2017. In 2020, the US and NATO allies promised to leave Afghanistan as long as the Taliban agreed to certain things: not allowing terrorists to operate in its area, and starting peace talks with the Afghanistan government. In mid-2021, the Taliban began a military offensive to enlarge their territory as US and allied forces began to leave. By August 15, 2021, the Taliban had recaptured Kabul and defeated the Afghan government. An anti-Taliban front took control of the Panjshir Valley, in August 2021 but lost control later that year due to the Taliban sending its forces.
