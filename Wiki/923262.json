 "text": "Ernestine Eckstein (April 23, 1941 – July 15, 1992) was a Black lesbian woman who fought for lesbian rights. Eckstein participated in LGBTQ rights protests that occurred before the famous Stonewall Riots of 1969. == Activism == Eckstein was often one of the few women at early LGBTQ rights protests. Usually she was the only Black women in attendance. Ernestine Eckstein was the vice president of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis organization. The Daughters of Bilitis were a nationwide group that fought for lesbian rights, and offered help to lesbians who needed it. Eckstein was on the cover of The Ladder in June 1966, fighting against racism in both the United States and the LGBTQ movement, representing a Black lesbian advocate. Eckstein believed that it was more important for her to fight for LGBTQ rights than Black rights because as a Black person she already had rights, but as a member of the LGBTQ community, she didn’t have the same freedom. == References == Category:1941 births Category:1992 deaths Category:American human rights activists Category:American LGBT rights activists",
