 "text": "A-flat minor is a minor scale starting on A. Its key signature has seven flats. Its relative major is C-flat major, and its parallel major is A-flat major. Its enharmonic equivalent is G-sharp minor. A-flat minor is rarely used as the main key of a piece of music. More often, pieces in a minor mode that have A as the tonic are written in the enharmonic key, G-sharp minor, because it has a simpler key signature. Because of this, there are few works in A-flat minor. In some scores, the A minor key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top. ==In classical music== * The Funeral March in Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 12, Op. 26 * An early section of the last movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 31, Op. 110 (although the key signature of this section uses only 6 flats, not 7) * Johannes Brahms's Fugue for organ (c. 1857) * Max Bruch's Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, Op. 88a (although at least one two-piano transcription of this uses a 6-flat signature, similarly to the Op. 110 Beethoven example) * the Evocación from Book I of Isaac Albéniz's Iberia *Isaac Albéniz's La Vega (c. 1897) * Leoš Janáček uses it for his violin sonata and the organ solo of his Glagolitic Mass. * Moritz Moszkowski used it for his piano étude, opus 72 number 13. * Also Polonaise in A-Flat Minor, Chopin ==In popular music== A-flat minor is also used in Frederick Loewe's score to the 1956 musical play My Fair Lady; the Second Servants' Chorus is set in A-flat minor. Another example of popular music in A-flat minor is Walkin' on the Sun by Smash Mouth. ==Scales and keys== ==Other websites== * Overview of Compositions with 7 Accidentals ==References== Category:Musical keys Category:Minor scales",
