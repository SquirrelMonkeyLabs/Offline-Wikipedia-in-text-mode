 "text": "\"Burundi Bwacu\" (; \"Our Burundi\") is the national anthem of Burundi. ==Lyrics== ===Kirundi lyrics=== Kirundi original Kirundi original (with tonal diacritics â€“ ) IPA transcription ===Translations=== French translation English translation Our Burundi, gentle country, Take your place in the concert of nations, Acceding to independence with honourable intentions. Wounded and bruised, you have remained master of yourself. When the hour came, you arose, Lifting yourself proudly into the ranks of free peoples. Receive, then, the congratulations of the nations And the homage of your sons and daughters. May your name ring out through the universe, May your name ring out through the universe. Our Burundi, sacred heritage from our forefathers, Recognised as worthy of self-government, With your courage you also have a sense of honour. Sing the glory of liberty conquered again. Our Burundi, worthy of our tenderest love, We vow to your noble service our hands and hearts and lives. May God, who gave you to us, keep you for us to venerate, Under the shield of unity, In peace, joy and prosperity. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Burundi",
