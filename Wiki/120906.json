 "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies are an American professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They play their home games at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1995, the team began playing in the NBA. The team was then in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was called the Vancouver Grizzlies. In 2001, the Grizzlies moved to Memphis because the previous owner, Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, started losing money on the franchise due to low attendance and a weak Canadian dollar. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:National Basketball Association teams Category:Memphis, Tennessee Category:2001 establishments in the United States Category:2000s establishments in Tennessee",
