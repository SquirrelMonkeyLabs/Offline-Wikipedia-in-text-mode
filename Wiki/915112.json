It used to cover the entire state, but after it was split by 813 in 1953, 904 in 1965, 407 in 1988, and 954 in 1995, it now covers the far southern portion of Florida, specifically the Miami section and the Florida Keys sections of Florida. It was partially overlaid by 786 on March 1, 1998 for the Miami-Dade County area only and then later extended to Florida Keys and the rest of Monroe Country in 2001. It was also overlaid 645 on August 4, 2023. == References == Category:Florida 305",
