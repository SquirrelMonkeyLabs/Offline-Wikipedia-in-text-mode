It lives in Chile. ==Body== The adult male frog is 39.5 - 59.8 mm long from nose to rear end and some female frogs were 39.7 and 63.4 mm long. This frog has a yellow triangle and a brown stripe on its head. The skin of the frog's back is light brown in color. The belly is white in color. The iris of the eye is black in color with bronze lines. ==Home== This frog lives in forests. Scientists saw the frog between 533 and 1100 meters above sea level. They saw it in one protected place: Reserva Costera Valdiviana. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in cold streams where the water is fast. ==Threats== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings changed the places where it lives by changing forest to pine tree farms and eucalyptus tree farms can hurt the frog. It is also hotter and there is less rain, which means there are more fires. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
