 "text": "It's On (~~Dr. Dre~~) 187um Killa is the second EP by American rapper Eazy-E. It was released on October 25, 1993. The producers of the album were Eazy-E, DJ Yella, Rhythum D, Madness 4 Real, Dr. Jam and Cold 187um. The EP was certified 2x Platinum in late 1994. The album is a reply to then rival/former N.W.A bandmate Dr Dre. The songs \"Real Muthaphuckkin G's\" and \"It's On\" are diss songs meant to insult Dr Dre and his then new protegee Snoop Doggy Dogg. Other tracks such as \"Down 2 tha Last Roach\", \"Any Last Werdz\", \"Still a Nigga\" and \"Exxtra Special Thankz\" are about the gangster lifestyle. The song \"Gimme That Nutt\" tells a rather sexually vulgar story that was banned from being played on radio stations. ==Songs== ==References== Category:1993 albums Category:Eazy-E albums",
