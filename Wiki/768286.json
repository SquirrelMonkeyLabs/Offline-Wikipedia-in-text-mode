Most people living in Malta can talk in languages that are not native to the country, mostly English and Italian. The Eurobarometer poll done in 2012 says 98% of people living in Malta can talk in Maltese, 88% can talk in English, 66% can talk in Italian, and more than 17% can talk in French. In 1995, 98% of people living in Malta could talk in Maltese, 76% could talk in English, 36% could talk in Italian, and 10% could talk in French. Fluency in Italian has increased after Italian was no longer an official language of Malta because Italian television broadcasts reach Malta.Country profile: Malta BBC News; [2008/01/10]; [2008/02/21] According to the 2011 census, there were 377,952 people aged 10 and over.
