 "text": "An electric switchboard is an electrical device that directs electricity from one place to another. It is usually seen as an electrical panel in an enclosure, which contains switches for doing different things. One of the most common differences for an electric switchboard is a series of differently connected electrical panels. Each of the panels in turn has a line of switches that make it possible to control the flow of electricity. Making use of the switches, it is possible to change the voltage that is sent to connected devices, making sure that the flow is not enough to cause damage to, or hurt, the circuitry. From this viewpoint, the electric switchboard can be seen as a way of improving electronic safety in the use of different appliances, machinery, and other things. Category:Electricity",
