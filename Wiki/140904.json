 "text": "\"The Middle\" is a 2001 song released by Jimmy Eat World from their album, Bleed American. It is the third song from their album. The song is not what is usually heard from the band. It is one of the more straightforward, upbeat songs, its also one of their most well-known singles. There is electric guitar, drums and vocals used in this song, typical for a punk/rock song. ==Music video== The band are featured in this music video. It also shows girls in their bikinis and a swimming pool, and someone goes into it during the guitar solo so for a moment its kinda faded out, but then he goes back to the surface. At the start of this video, two people in a car get out and go inside to the party. ==Live performance== Taylor Swift and Jim Adkins performed the song together twice. The first time was on Swift's Speak Now World Tour during the Glendale, Arizona show on October 22, 2011. ==References== Category:2001 songs",
