 "text": "The Memphis & Arkansas Bridge, also known as the Memphisâ€“Arkansas Bridge is a cantilevered truss bridge carrying Interstate 55 over the Mississippi River between West Memphis, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee. People who live in Memphis call this bridge the \"Old Bridge\", because it is older than the \"New Bridge\", or the Hernando de Soto Bridge, upstream. The bridge also carries U.S. Route 61 (US 61), US 64, US 70 and US 79. The bridge was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. ==References== Category:Memphis, Tennessee Category:Bridges in Tennessee Category:Buildings and structures in Arkansas Category:Transport in Arkansas",
