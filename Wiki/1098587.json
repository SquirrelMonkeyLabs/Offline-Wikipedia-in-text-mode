The adult male frog is 27.9-33.8 mm long from nose to rear end and at least one female frog was 31.6 mm long. The skin of the frog's back, head, and the tops of the legs has spikes on it. The is a mark in the shape of the letter Y that goes from between the eyes to the middle of the back. This frog lives in bamboo forests on mountains. People have seen this frog between 1100 and 1340 meters above sea level. This frog can only live in forests. The female frog lays eggs in holes in bamboo plants that have water in them. Scientists say this frog is in a large danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place and human beings change that place in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. For example, human beings take away bamboo to use. Scientists think taking some bamboo might not hurt the frog but people must not take too much bamboo. This frog lives in at least one protected park: Taoyuandong National Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
