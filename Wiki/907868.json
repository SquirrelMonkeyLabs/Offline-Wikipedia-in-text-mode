They are made to be shown at motor shows and are not mass-produced. General Motors designer Harley Earl is known for inventing the concept car. Concept cars never go into production directly. They must undergo many changes before the car is ready to be sold publicly. Safety and regulatory checks are required to make sure the final design is road legal. Concept cars can look distinct from the final product.Chrysler \"Jolts\" PHEV Race; PHEV Ads; V2Green Acquired , September 24, 2008, CalCars (California Cars Initiative) == References == Category:Automobiles",
