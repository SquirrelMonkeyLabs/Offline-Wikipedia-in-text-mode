In 1950, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II paid her to let them make a play based on her book and then made The King and I. Landon also wrote another novel called Never Dies the Dream. In 1972, Twentieth Century Fox made a television show called Anna and the King which wasn’t a musical and Landon sued Fox for Copyright infringement but lost.
