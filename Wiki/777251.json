It drew promises of action from officials at every level of government.\" 2019 Local reporting Brian M. Rosenthal The New York Times \"for unearthing a pernicious scheme by unscrupulous lenders to drive up the price of taxi medallions and turn huge profits by selling them to unsophisticated cab drivers with loans they could never repay, leading borrowers into financial ruin so devastating at least nine committed suicide.\" 2019 International reporting Mark Scheffler and Malachy Browne and the Visual Investigations Team The New York Times \"for using local plane spottings, satellite imagery, cockpit recordings and Google Earth tools to map and geolocate the attacks to establish that Russian pilots in Syria bombed four hospitals, a busy commercial street and a refugee camp, killing scores of civilians. It was one of a number of wide-ranging coups the team pulled off combining advanced technology with ground level reporting in Venezuela, Afghanistan, Libya, North Korea and Hong Kong.\" 2019 Financial reporting Noah Buhayar and Caleb Melby and David Kocieniewski Bloomberg News \"for groundbreaking stories on how wealthy, well-connected individuals perverted the stated intention of \"opportunity zone\" incentives in the 2017 federal tax code for their own profit. The program was aimed at spurring economic growth in depressed areas, but some developers reaped tax breaks by using it for such high-end projects as a long-planned $4 billion luxury North Miami development and the construction of a Ritz-Carlton hotel in downtown Portland, Oregon.\" 2019 Business reporting Dominic Gates and Mike Baker and Steve Militech and Lewis Kamb The Seattle Times \"for first exposing the cooperative arrangements between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration that led to approval of design changes in 737 Max jets blamed for two crashes, killing 346. Times reporters traced FAA approval of the flawed flight control system to its decision to defer to Boeing's own safety analysis, which they attributed to pressure from leaders of the company and the agency to speed production and avoid adding costs.\" 2019 Environmental reporting Helena Bottemiller Evich Politico \"for describing how a politicized Department of Agriculture ignored its own climate action plan, devoted a portion of its budget to climate change, which it acknowledges is the gravest threat to food production, and buried a study warning of lost nutrients in rice, the leading source of nutrition for 600 million people, provoking a highly regarded scientist to quit in disgust.\" 2019 Military reporting Craig Whitlock The Washington Post \"forcing the release of interviews conducted about the Afghan War as part of a five-year, $11 million federal Lessons Learned project. After Whitlock received more than 2,000 documents, including some initially withheld, he puzzled out key redactions before producing \"The Afghanistan Papers,\" which demonstrated that \"senior U.S. officials failed to tell the truth about the war in Afghanistan throughout the 18-year campaign, making rosy pronouncements they knew to be false and hiding unmistakable evidence the war had become unwinnable.\"\" 2019 Justice reporting Lisa Gartner The Philadelphia Inquirer \"for Beaten, Not Silenced, which exposed a pattern of violent physical abuse of boys housed at the Glen Mills Schools, a 193-year-old reformatory in suburban Delaware County. Gartner's reporting was so devastating that within days state officials ordered Glen Mills closed and pledged to do a better job of monitoring conditions at juvenile justice facilities across Pennsylvania.\" 2019 Political reporting Chance Swaim and Jonathan Shorman and Dion Lefler The Wichita Eagle \"for turning journalistic intuition into deep dives into public records that revealed municipal misconduct.\" 2019 Political reporting Luke Broadwater and staff The Baltimore Sun \"for turning journalistic intuition into deep dives into public records that revealed municipal misconduct.\" 2019 Magazine reporting Lizzie Presser ProPublica and The New Yorker \"for The Dispossessed, an account of how speculators use legal loopholes associated with \"heirs' property\" laws in the South to seize black-owned ancestral lands, uprooting lifelong residents who assume their homes and property have been passed down to them. Especially poignant was Presser's portrait of two brothers in a North Carolina coastal town jailed for nearly eight years for refusing to leave.\" 2019 Television reporting John Sudworth BBC News \"for Inside China's Hidden Camps, which documented the reality of camps authorities established in Xinjiang province to indoctrinate hundreds of thousands of Muslims in an effort to erase their religion and culture. Allowed by authorities to visit one camp depicted as a model of agreeability, Sudworth used satellite photos, leaked documents and interviews with forlorn parents separated from their children to paint a very different picture.\" 2019 Special Award Nikole Hannah-Jones and contributors The New York Times \"for The 1619 Project, a supplement published on the 400th anniversary of the advent of American slavery, using essays by journalists and scholars to explore the role of slavery in history and its enduring effects in contemporary American society. A powerful introduction by Hannah-Jones, the project's creator and driving force, examined efforts of black Americans to advance the nation's expressed ideals of democracy, liberty and equality in the face of centuries of oppression and exclusion.\" 2018 Special Award David Ignatius and Karen Attiah The Washington Post \"Jamal Khashoggi\" 2018 Special Award Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark APM Reports “In the Dark: Season Two” 2018 Local Television Reporting Award Joe Bruno WSOC-TV in Charlotte, N.C. \"McCrae Dowless\" 2018 Foreign Television Reporting Award Jane Ferguson PBS NewsHour \"Houthi-controlled northern Yemen\" 2018 Magazine Reporting Award Ben Taub The New Yorker “Iraq’s Post-ISIS Campaign of Revenge” 2018 Environmental Reporting Award Larry C.
