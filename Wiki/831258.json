Farmers prayed to the two deities for a doubling of the previous year's yield, after the harvest. Phoukourol (Phoukouron or Phougourol or Phougouron) is a sacred hymn to call the spirit of the paddy. It is generally sung during harvesting. It is done before the harvested crops are stored in the grain house. The Phou Kouba (calling the paddy/rice) ceremony is usually performed during mis-happenings to the farmers. Mis-happenings may be theft or burning of the paddy/rice, an animal like cow trespasses the threshing ground, etc. People perform the rites and rituals to induce the deity to stay at their places. Sareng fish (Wallago attu, helicopter catfish) with rice is the most important offering to the deity. It should be cooked with herbs and not with spices. == References == == Other websites == Category:Kings in Meitei mythology Category:Meitei gods and goddesses Category:Gods and goddesses of agriculture Category:Gods and goddesses of fertility",
