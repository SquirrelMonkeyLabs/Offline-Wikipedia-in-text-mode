 "text": "In mathematics, function composition is a way of making a new function from two other functions through a chain-like process. More specifically, given a function f from X to Y and a function g from Y to Z, then the function \"g composed with f\", written as g ∘ f, is a function from X to Z (notice how it is usually written in the opposite way to how people would expect it to be). The value of f given the input x is written as f(x). The value of g ∘ f given the input x is written as (g ∘ f)(x), and is defined as g(f(x)). As an example. let f be a function which doubles a number (multiplies it by 2), and let g be a function which subtracts 1 from a number. These two functions can be written as: :f(x) = 2x :g(x) = x - 1 Here, g composed with f would be the function which doubles a number, and then subtracts 1 from it. That is: :(g \\circ f)(x) = 2x - 1 On the other hand, f composed with g would be the function which subtracts 1 from a number, and then doubles it: :(f \\circ g)(x) = 2(x-1) Composition of functions can also be generalized to binary relations, where it is sometimes represented using the same \\circ symbol (as in R \\circ S). ==Properties== Function composition can be proven to be associative, which means that: :f \\circ (g \\circ h) = (f \\circ g) \\circ h However, function composition is in general not commutative, which means that: :f \\circ g eq g \\circ f This can be also seen in the first example, where (g ∘ f)(2) = 2*2 - 1 = 3 and (f ∘ g)(2) = 2*(2-1) = 2. == Related pages == * Chain rule ==References== Category:Mathematics",
