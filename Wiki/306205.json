 "text": "Back to Basics is the fifth studio album by Christina Aguilera. It was released on August 9 2006 as a double album. She worked with many producers, including DJ Premier, Rich Harrison, and Mark Ronson. The album was recorded between February 2005 and April 2006 in the US and the UK. Inspired by singers from the 1920s to 1950s, like Billie Holiday and Etta James, Aguilera combined jazz and soul with a new sound. The first part of the album mixes R&B; with hip-hop sounds from older songs, while the second part uses mostly original music. Many songs were about her personal life, including her marriage to Jordan Bratman in 2005. To match the album’s style, Aguilera used a new identity, Baby Jane, and dressed in a Hollywood look. She promoted Back to Basics by performing at award shows and a world tour from 2006 to 2008. The album made three big hits: “Ain’t No Other Man,” “Hurt,” and “Candyman.” Two other songs, “Slow Down Baby” and “Oh Mother,” were released in some countries. People praised the album’s special sound but some felt it was too long. “Ain’t No Other Man” won a Grammy Award Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Back to Basics started at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 346,000 copies sold in its first week. It also topped charts in over 15 countries and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. == Disc 1 == == Disc 2 == ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2006) Peak position Canadian Albums (Billboard) 1 Czech Albums (ČNS IFPI) 4 European Top 100 Albums (Billboard) 1 Greek Albums (IFPI) 5 Japanese Albums (Oricon) 7 Polish Albums (ZPAV) 9 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2006) Position Australian Albums (ARIA) 45 Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria) 27 Dutch Albums (MegaCharts) 42 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) 45 Hungarian Albums (MAHASZ) 63 Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) 16 UK Albums (OCC) 56 US Billboard 200 59 Chart (2007) Position Australian Albums (ARIA) 34 Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria) 43 Dutch Albums (MegaCharts) 88 French Albums (SNEP) 109 New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) 43 Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) 53 UK Albums (OCC) 127 US Billboard 200 73 ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Christina Aguilera albums",
