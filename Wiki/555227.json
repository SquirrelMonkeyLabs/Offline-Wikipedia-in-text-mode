He was the father of Anne and Margot Frank and husband of Edith Frank, and was the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust. He inherited Anne's manuscripts after her death, arranged for the publication of her diary as \"Het Achterhuis\" in 1947 (known in English as The Diary of a Young Girl), and oversaw its adaptation to both theater and film. ==References== Category:European Jews Category:1889 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Holocaust survivors Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:People from Frankfurt Category:People from Amsterdam Category:Anne Frank",
