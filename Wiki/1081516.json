 "text": "Giddha (, ਗਿੱਧਾ, ) is a popular folk dance of women in the Punjab region of Pakistan and India. Women perform this dance mainly at festive or social occasions. The dance is accompanied by clapping, with a typical traditional folk song performed by elder women in the background. Women stand in a circle formation and clap rhythms. A lead woman will recite a boli (lyrics) and the entire circle then repeats. The whole form of a giddha song is worked through in this call and response form. Giddha details stories of women's lives, including sexuality. == History == Giddha is said to be originated from the ancient ring dance which was dominant in Punjab in the olden days. Women show the same level of energy which the men show while performing bhangra. Giddha displays a traditional mode of performing Punjabi femininity, as seen through dress, choreography, and language. == Dress code == Traditionally, women used to wear salwar kameez and Ghagra in bright colours and jewellery. The attire is completed by dressing the hair in two braids and folk ornaments. == References == Category:Punjab Category:Folk dances of Pakistan",
