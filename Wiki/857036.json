 "text": "Post-punk (originally called new musick) is a large genre of rock music. It started in the late 1970s when musicians got tired of the how simple regular punk rock was. Post-punk artists added avant-garde ideas and other ideas from outside rock music. They kept punk rock's energy and DIY ethic but added styles like funk, electronic music, jazz, and dance music; the production techniques of dub and disco; and ideas from art and politics, including critical theory, modernist art, cinema and literature. These communities produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines. ==Notable artists== * Au Pairs * Cabaret Voltaire * Devo * Gang of Four * Joy Division * Magazine * Pere Ubu * Public Image Ltd * Siouxsie and the Banshees * Talking Heads * The Cure * The Fall * the Pop Group * the Slits * Wire Category:Music genres",
