 "text": "Kahoot! is a fee-based online quiz game that is commonly used by teachers and some companies. Its learning games, also known as \"kahoots\", are user-made multiple-choice quizzes that can be played via a web browser or the Kahoot! app. Kahoot! was founded in 2012 by Johan Brand, Jamie Brooker, and Morten Versvik as a project with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The user enters a Game PIN on the bottom of the appâ€™s screen, and the next screen lets you type the nickname of your choice or you can choose to press the spinner button when the Nickname generator option is enabled. Kahoot! can also be used to review students' knowledge or as a break from any traditional classroom activities. Kahoot! also includes trivia quizzes anytime, anywhere. Kahoot! is known for its multiplayer quizzes for any subject, and in any language. During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, Kahoot! can also be played during online learning using video conferencing tools such as Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet by sharing your screen with the video call by tapping the Share screen icon on the conferencing tool. ==Other websites== * Kahoot!
