 "text": "According to Puya (Meitei texts), death (\"shiba\" or \"siba\") is known as \"Thawai Hakchang Khainaba\" (Separation between soul and body). The \"Yaibi Thawai\" (soul or spirit) has no death, what dies is the body. When the soul leaves the body, the moment is called death. There are two ways of death: natural and unnatural. The death ceremony in Meitei culture is called \"Pot- Loiba\" (Finishing of the body elements- fire, wind, water and earth). Accordingly, there are four kinds of Pot-Loiba, which are: # Nungshit Pot- Loi:- death ceremony through wind or air. # Ishing Pot-Loi:- death ceremony through water. # Leipaak Pot-Loi:- death ceremony through earth, burial. # Mei Pot-Loi:- death ceremony through fire, burning. ==Other websites== * https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336071564_Mortuary_Customs_Of_The_Meiteis_Of_Manipur_A_Historical_Study * https://journals.eduindex.org/index.php/hrj/article/view/8051 ==References== Category:Meitei religion",
