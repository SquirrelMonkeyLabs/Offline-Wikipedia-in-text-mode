When David Attenborough began his career, in 1950, Earth's human population was measured at just 2.5 billion people ... in 2012 he said: > “We cannot continue to deny the problem. People have pushed aside the > question of population sustainability and not considered it because it is > too awkward, embarrassing and difficult. But we have to talk about it″. In January 2013, while being interviewed by Radio Times, he said: > “We are a plague on the Earth. It’s coming home to roost over the next 50 > years or so. It’s not just climate change; it’s sheer space, places to grow > food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the > natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us > right now”. In a Daily Telegraph interview in September 2013 he said: > \"What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?\" / \"They're > about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we > are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of > flour. That's barmy\". == References == ==Other websites== * Official David Attenborough website * As patron of Population Matters Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Commanders of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Companions of Honour Category:English science writers Category:English television presenters Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Knights Bachelor Category:English naturalists Category:Order of Merit Category:Writers from Leicester Category:1926 births Category:Living people",
