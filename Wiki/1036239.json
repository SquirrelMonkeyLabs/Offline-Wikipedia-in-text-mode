 "text": "The Karin bubble-nest frog, cricket frog, tiny bubble-nest frog, dwarf bush frog, Karin shrub frog, or dwarf shrub frog (Raorchestes parvulus) is a frog. It lives in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Scientists have seen it in between 46 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog mostly lives in evergreen forests but people have also seen it in grassy places. It stays in trees and close-growing plants far from water. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog, like other frogs in Raorchestes. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings cut down the forests where the frog lives, especially to make farms to grow palm oil and to get wood to build with. However, the frog lives in such a large place that it lives in many protected parks in at least three countries. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
