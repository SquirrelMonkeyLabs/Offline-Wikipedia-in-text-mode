 "text": "Nome is a city on the southern Seward Peninsula coast on Norton Sound of the Bering Sea. It is in the Nome Census Area of the U.S. state of Alaska. The city of Nome claims to be home to the world's largest gold pan. But the Canadian city of Quesnel, British Columbia also says they do. In the winter of 1925, there was a diphtheria epidemic among Inuit in the Nome area. Blizzard conditions made delivery of a life-saving serum by airplane from Anchorage impossible. A serum run to Nome by dog sled teams delivered the serum. The sled driver of the final leg of the relay was the Norwegian-born Gunnar Kaasen; his lead sled dog was Balto. The annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race commemorates this historic event. Nome is home to Alaska's oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget. The reality television series Bering Sea Gold is set and filmed in Nome. ==References== Category:Cities in Alaska",
