 "text": "Compactness is a property of mathematics that seeks to generalize the idea of closed and bounded sets. A compact space has no gaps or missing parts, and it includes all the limit points. For example, the interval (0,1) is not compact because the closure points 0 and 1 are not included of this interval. But [0,1] is compact because its both closure points are included to this interval. Category:Mathematics Category:Topology",
