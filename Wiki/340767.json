 "text": "The Emblem of Angola is the national emblem. It shows the recent past of the new nation. There are Marxist pictures. In the center is a machete and hoe. These show the revolution through which the nation gained independence, and the importance of agricultural workers. Above both emblems is a red star. The red star is often in many socialist images. The rising sun is the normal symbol of a new beginning. The half cog-wheel is for the industrial workers. The half vine of coffee and cotton leaves is for the coffee and cotton industry. At the bottom is an open book that is for education. A banner reads \"Republic of Angola\" at the bottom, in Portuguese. ==Historical coats of arms== File:Coat of arms of Portuguese West Africa (1935-1951).svg|Coat of arms of Portuguese West Africa between May 8, 1935 - June 11, 1951.
