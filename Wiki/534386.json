In 2015, Ezaki had regained the use of his legs and was able to stand on his own and walk with a cane. On 3 April 2015, Hayabusa took part in a press conference which announced the return of FMW. He had served as the executive producer of the promotion. ==Death== On 3 March 2016, Ezaki died from a subarachnoid hemorrhage at age 47.
