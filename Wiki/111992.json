 "text": "Alemannic German () is a group of dialects of the Upper German branch of the Germanic language family. It is spoken by about ten million people in southern Germany, Switzerland, France, Austria, Liechtenstein, and Italy. In Switzerland it is sometimes called Swiss German. In Alsace, the language is usually called Alsatian. Outside this area: the village Zădăreni in Romania, Old-order Amish in Adams County and Allen County in the United States, and Colonia Tovar in Venezuela. In the US: the Bernese dialects are stable, and spoken by about 5% of all Amish (15.000 people), Alsatian dialects are in decline there. In contrast to other languages, Alemannic German is only a spoken language; there is no fixed orthography for the language. ==References== Category:German dialects Category:Languages of Germany Category:Languages of Switzerland",
