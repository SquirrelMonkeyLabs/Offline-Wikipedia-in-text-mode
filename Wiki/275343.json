 "text": "Person of the Year is a special issue of the American magazine Time. It has been published each year since 1927. Until 1999, it was called \"Man of the Year.\" The \"Person of the Year\" is not always a person. It can be a person, group, idea, or thing that \"for better or for worse...has done the most to influence the events of the year\". This means that being chosen is not an award, like being chosen as the \"best person of the year.\" The Person of the Year may be an enemy of the United States, like Adolf Hitler (1938) or Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942). Every year, Time chooses the person who they think has had the most effect on the things that have happened in that year (whether those things were good or bad). The first Man of the Year was aviator Charles Lindbergh, in 1927. Since then, Persons of the Year have included groups, whole generations, important objects, and even the Earth. Since the list began, every serving President of the United States has been a Person of the Year at least once, except for Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, and Gerald Ford. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have been named Person of the Year three times. The December 31, 1999 issue of Time named Albert Einstein the \"Person of the Century\". Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as runners-up. ==Persons of the Year== Year Image Choice Lifetime Notes Runners-up 1927 1902–1974 Lindbergh completed the first solo transatlantic flight in May 1927 by piloting his monoplane Spirit of St. Louis from Garden City, New York to Paris, France. 1928 1875–1940 In 1928, Chrysler oversaw a merger of his company, Chrysler, with Dodge before beginning work on the Chrysler Building. 1929 1874–1962 Young chaired a committee which authored 1929's Young Plan, a program for settlement of German reparations after World War I. 1930 1869–1948 Gandhi was the leader of India's independence movement.
