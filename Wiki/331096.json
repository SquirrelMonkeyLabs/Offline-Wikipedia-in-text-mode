 "text": "The News Corporation (or 'News Corp.') was an Australian, and later American, mass media corporation. It was based in New York City, New York. It was the world's second biggest media company in revenue in 2011, and the world's third largest company in entertainment in 2009. News Corporation was founded in Adelaide in 1979, by Rupert Murdoch. It was incorporated under South Australian commercial law until 2004 when the company moved to the United States. It was re-incorporated under Delaware law after its shareholders approved the move on 12 November 2004. It was a publicly traded company listed on the NASDAQ. Murdoch remained the chairman and chief executive officer of the company until its end in 2013. It owns News Limited, News International (whose properties include The Times, The Sun, and the now-closed News of the World), Dow Jones & Company (which owned The Wall Street Journal), the book publisher HarperCollins, and the Fox Entertainment Group (owners of the 20th Century Fox film studio and the Fox Broadcasting Company). News Corporation was split into two different companies on 28 June 2013. Both are publicly traded companies: 21st Century Fox consists mainly of television and media assets, while a new News Corp focuses on publishing. ==Filmed entertainment== * 20th Century Fox * Fox Searchlight Pictures * 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment * Blue Sky Studios * 20th Century Fox Español * 20th Century Fox International * Fox Studios Australia * Fox Studios LA * Fox Television Studios * Shine Group ==Television== ===Broadcast/production assets=== * 20th Century Fox Television * 20th Television * Foxtel * Fox Broadcasting Company * Fox International Channels ** Fox International Channels Italy ** Fox International Channels Portugal * Fox Sports Australia * Fox Telecolombia * Fox Television Stations * Fox Television Studios * Imedi Media Holding * Latvijas Neatkarīgā Televīzija * MyNetworkTV * STAR TV * TV5 Rīga ===Cable assets=== * Big Ten Network (49%) * Fox Business Network * Fox College Sports * Fox Movie Channel * Fox News Channel * Fox Soccer Channel * Fox Sports Enterprises * Fox Sports en Español * Foxtel (25%) - * Fox Sports Net * FUEL TV * FX Networks * Fox Reality Channel * National Geographic Channel (50%) ** National Geographic Channel UK (50%) * Speed Channel * SportSouth * LAPTV (Latin America — co-owned with Paramount Pictures/Viacom, Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer/MGM Holdings and Universal Studios/NBC Universal) * Telecine (Brazil — co-owned with Globosat Canais, Paramount Pictures, MGM, Universal Studios and DreamWorks); ===Television assets=== * BSkyB [United Kingdom] (39.1%) * Sky Deutschland [Germany] (49.90%) * SKY Italia [Italy] (100%) * SKY Network Television [New Zealand] (43.65%) * Foxtel [Australia] (25%) * Star TV [India & Greater China] (100%) * Tata Sky [India] (20%) ==Internet== * Fox Interactive Media ** AmericanIdol.com ** AskMen.com ** Fox.com ** Foxsports.com ** GameSpy ** Hulu.com ** IGN ** MyNetworktv.com ** Scout.com ** WhatIfSports * News Digital Media * Authonomy via HarperCollins * MySpace (5%) ==Magazines and inserts== All titles sourced from News Limited - NewsSource: Magazines on 15 October 2010. * Alpha * Australian Football Weekly * Australian Golf Digest * Australian Good Taste (with Woolworths) * Australian Parents (with Woolworths) * Best of the Gold Coast Magazine * Big League * Chopper * Country Style * delicious.
