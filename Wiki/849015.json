 "text": "Rabbids, also known as Raving Rabbids and in France as Lapins crétins (\"moronic rabbits\"), is a video game franchise published by Ubisoft. It originated as a spin-off video game from the Rayman series, 2006's Rayman Raving Rabbids, and is centered on a fictional species of mischievous rabbit- like creatures known as Rabbids, who speak gibberish and scream wildly whenever they experience an adrenaline rush. The series consists mainly of party video games, though other genres have been explored as well. ==Development== The earliest Rayman 4 trailers depicted menacing rabbits, simply appearing from underground with a blank stare in various shapes and forms, smaller eyes and furry. At this point, trailers showed the game as an adventure game with fight stages, where Rayman would need to punch and kick himself kung fu style through a horde of zombie-bunnies. As the game concept evolved, from one of a central objective to minigames, a series of viral videos were created by Marketing Manager Adrian Lacey and Animator Charles Beirnaert which became incredibly successful on the new media platform YouTube. The rabbits slowly evolved into various merchandising products such as the Rabbid figures, which were much more conscious and amusing, changing from merely being enemies to fight through into more memorable characters with various traits and quirks. Rayman creator Michel Ancel described the bunnies as \"vicious, but at the same time [...] totally stupid\". In a video interview, project lead Loïc Gounon confirmed the possibility of splitting the Rayman and Rabbid series apart, mentioning that the Rabbids \"managed to hit a bit more adult and a bit more older audience than the previous Raymans\". By 2009's Rabbids Go Home, Rayman does not make an appearance; when asked about the omission of Rayman during an interview about Rabbids Go Home, director Jacques Exertier provided an assurance that Rayman would return for more action- adventure video games. The music style for the franchise was created by composer Mark Griskey. Mark worked with Audio Director Yoan Fanise to define the comedic style of the early games and the style was continued with the further versions of the franchise. ==Characters== Rabbids - Rabbids are wild rabbit-like creatures who like to cause havoc and mischief on Rayman's world (where they came from), the human world, and others and are gibberish speaking and yell \"BWAH!\" whenever they experience adrenaline rushes. They were originally the antagonists; however, due to increase in popularity, they became the protagonists in Rabbids Go Home. A notable Rabbid who first appeared in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is Rabbid Peach. Rayman - the main protagonist of the first three games. He always foils the Rabbids' evil plans. When the Rabbids became the protagonists of the franchise, Rayman was dropped, but continues to appear in his own games. Professor Barranco III - the supreme leader of the Rabbids who planned out all of their invasions on Rayman's world, Earth and others. He is seen in the games Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Rabbids: Travel in Time and Rabbids: Alive and Kicking as the main antagonist (despite having a minor role in RRR 2 and RTiT). He is one of the rare smart Rabbids to exist, but can be easily fooled as well. In RAaK he has a Rabbid scientist as his second in command, who would later go on to become a major character in the TV series. Serguei - Serguei is the main villain of Rayman Raving Rabbids. He is a large, black rabbid who abducted Rayman and the Globox kids and forced them to take part in the Rabbids Olympics filled with deadly challenges. In the end, Rayman manages to escape and free most of the Globox kids. It is unknown what happens to Serguei at that point, though his absence in further games suggest that he was relieved of his duties due to failure in keeping Rayman. The Semi-Leaders - the Semi-leaders are fat, lazy and angry Rabbids who serve as the secondary antagonists of Rayman Raving Rabbids 2. They constantly force the Rabbids to bring them food and don't do pretty much anything other than sitting or lying around and keeping things in check. They each have different themes in clothing. ==Games== Year Title Developer(s) Platform(s) 2006 Rayman Raving Rabbids Ubisoft Montpellier, Ubisoft Sofia Windows, Xbox 360, PS2, Wii, GBA, DS 2007 Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 Ubisoft Paris Windows, Wii, DS 2008 Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party Wii, DS 2009 Rabbids Go Home Ubisoft Montpellier, Ubisoft Sofia Windows, Wii, DS 2010 Raving Rabbids: Travel in Time Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Casablanca Wii, 3DS Rabbids Go Phone Ubisoft iOS 2011 Raving Rabbids: Alive & Kicking Ubisoft Milan, Ubisoft Paris Xbox 360 Raving Rabbids: Party Collection (Feat.

In Red Steel, the Rabbids appear as enemies in one of the game's later stages. The Wii version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up includes three different types of Rabbids as playable characters, along with a stage based on Rabbids Go Home. Toys of the Rabbids appear as hidden easter eggs in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction and Watch Dogs. In Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, a cheat can be used to turn the game's enemies into Rabbids. The song \"Here Comes the Hotstepper\" in Just Dance 2 includes a Rabbid who attempts to dance with the choreographer. Similarly, the alternate version of the song \"Naughty Girl\" in the Nintendo Switch version of Just Dance 2018 via Just Dance Unlimited subscription service includes Rabbid Peach from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle as the main choreographer. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate features three Rabbids from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle as unlockable spirits and a Rabbid Mii Fighter hat was available as downloadable content on January 28, 2020. On April Fools' Day 2019, For Honor featured a limited time event in which Rabbids replaced all of the game's characters. In 2021, they have been featured in The Crew 2 as their own LIVE Summit Event, as well as introducing two vanity cosmetic items into the game. The first is roofrack of a Rabbid hanging on to it and the second being a window tint full of Rabbids which can only be acquired by scoring platinum in the LIVE Summit. === TV series === In October 2010, Ubisoft and Aardman announced a partnership to produce a TV series pilot and several shorts based on the franchise. One year later, it was announced that 78 7-minute CG animated episodes would be made solely by Ubisoft Motion Pictures, and broadcast as 26 half-hour episodes by Nickelodeon on August 3, 2013. In early 2012, Ubisoft Motion Pictures called on the French animation studio TeamTO to create most of the CGI parts of the series. On E3 2013, it was announced that it would be an interactive Xbox One show entitled Rabbids Invasion. The show aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon from August 3, 2013 through June 23, 2017. On July 1, 2019, a fourth season was released on Netflix. === Film === A live-action/animated movie based on the franchise was in the works by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment. However, in 2019, Lionsgate and Ubisoft signed a deal to produce the Rabbids movie with Todd Strauss-Schulson in talks to direct the movie with Todd Lieberman and David Hoberman as producers. It is now being developed by Lionsgate, Ubisoft Motion Pictures, Mandeville Films, and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, with Matt Senreich, Tom Sheppard, and Zeb Wells set to write the film, while revised by Todd Rosenberg. === Comic book series === A comic book series based on the franchise has been released in France, Belgium and Switzerland. All comic strips are drawn by the French cartoonist Romain Pujol and written by Thithaume. There are ten volumes thus far. === Merchandising === Aside from video games and the comic book series mentioned above, the Rabbids also have other merchandising such as T-shirts, figurines, plush toys, school equipment, fan club magazines, and for a limited time, a Happy Meal toy. A Raving Rabbids themed version of the card game Jungle Speed was also released in France. === Licensing === The Rabbids franchise has also been licensed for the out-of-home entertainment market such as the recent collaboration with arcade game manufacturer LAI Games to produce Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride, an attendant- free VR attraction. == Reception == The Rabbids series, along with its titular characters, have become very popular. IGN has stated that the Rabbids have \"more personality and charisma than 10 of the most popular video game mascots combined\", and that the bunnies have literally \"upstaged Rayman himself\". GameSpot noted that the Rabbids themselves are \"almost exclusively responsible for [selling the game's humor], as they are, without a doubt, hysterical. They're adorably designed, with their dumb stares, high-pitched shrieks, and a penchant for taking comedic bumps.\" ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Video game series Category:2006 establishments Category:Mascots Category:Video game spin-offs Category:Video games about rabbits and hares Category:Fictional hares and rabbits Category:Ubisoft games Category:Rayman",
