 "text": "The Kleophrades Painter was a red-figure Athenian vase painter. His real name is unknown. His name is taken from a potter's signature on a vase. He was active from about 510470 BC. His work is considered some of the finest of the red figure style. He was probably the pupil of Euthymides, one of the red- figure Pioneers. His work is identified by its stylistic traits. He was very productive. More than 100 vases of his work have survived. He worked in both black- and red- figure styles and techniques. He was conservative, often using old-fashioned techniques. His subjects were traditional but with a emphasis on the Trojan War. He preferred painting large vessels such as amphores. == Related pages == * Kottabos (Kleophrades Painter) == References == * == Other websites == * Category:Ancient Greek painters Category:6th-century BC births Category:5th-century BC deaths Category:5th century BC in art Category:6th century BC in art",
