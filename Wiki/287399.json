 "text": "Boyle's law (also called Mariotte's law and the Boyle-Mariotte law) is a law about ideal gases. The law can be stated as follows: In other words, the volume of a constant mass of ideal gas at a constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure applied on it. In symbols, the law is: :P \\propto \\frac{1}{V} or : PV = k where P is the pressure of the gas, V is the volume of the gas, and k is a constant. For a given mass of gas at a constant temperature, the product of the pressure and the volume is constant. As the volume decreases, the pressure increases in proportion, and vice versa. For example, when the pressure halves, the volume doubles. Suppose you have a tank that contains a certain volume of gas at a certain pressure. When you decrease the volume of the tank, the same number of gas particles is now contained in a smaller space. Therefore, the number of collisions increases. Therefore, the pressure is greater. Imagine you have a gas at a certain pressure (P1) and volume (V1). If you change the pressure to a new value (P2), the volume changes to a new value (V2). We can use Boyle's law to describe both sets of conditions: :P_1 V_1 = k :P_2 V_2 = k The constant, k, is the same in both cases, so we can say the following: :P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 Example: The pressure of a gas is 3 atm and the volume is 5 litres. If the pressure is reduced to 2 atm, what is the volume? :P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 : V_2 = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{P_2} : V_2 = \\frac{3*5}{2} : V_2 = \\frac{15}{2} : V_2 = 7.5 âˆ´ The volume will be 7.5 litres. The law was found by Robert Boyle in 1662, and afterwards independently by Edme Mariotte in 1679. ==References== Category:Laws of physics Category:Science experiments Category:Thermodynamics Category:Physical chemistry",
