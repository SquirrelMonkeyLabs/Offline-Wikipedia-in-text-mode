 "text": "Tintoretto (1518 â€“ 31 May 1594), born Jacopo Comin, was an Italian Renaissance painter. He was known by the nickname Il Furioso. His works are very dramatic, often depicting muscular figures and a bold use of perspective. These elements he paints in the Mannerist style. His use of colour and light, however, is typical of the Venetian School. Tintoretto was from Venice. He spent most of his life painting there. He was a devout Roman Catholic. He painted frescos and other murals on the walls and ceilings of several churches and other buildings in Venice, such as the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, the Doge's Palace. His largest work is Il Paradiso, which dominates the main hall of the Doge's Palace. It is 22.6 x 9.1 metres in size, and is said to be the largest painting ever done on canvas. ==Related pages== * List of Italian painters == Notes == == References == * * Carlo Ridolfi, La Vita di Giacopo Robusti (A Life of Tintoretto) 1642 * Tintoretto, and Pierluigi De Vecchi. 1970.
