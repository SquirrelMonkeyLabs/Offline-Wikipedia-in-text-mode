 "text": "Cookie Monster is a Muppet that appears in Sesame Street. He is a blue alien that is known for eating lots of food, especially cookies. He is also known for some of his famous eating phrases. His favorite food is cookies, as his name implies. He especially enjoys chocolate chip cookies. Throughout the years of his presence, he has gained increasing awareness of children's food habits. In 2007, Cookie Monster had told his philosophy (way of thinking) that \"Cookies are a sometimes food.\" His speech is often grammatically incorrect; he always uses \"Me\" to refer to himself in place of \"I\",\"My\", and \"Mine\". Cookie Monster was mentioned by Siri, while saying \"And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad that you have no friends.\" When the Apple personal assistant Siri is asked the question, \"what is zero divided by zero\", Siri responds with the answer: \"Imagine that you have zero cookies and you split them evenly among zero friends. How many cookies does each person get? See? It doesnâ€™t make sense. And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad that you have no friends.\" ==References== Category:Muppets",
