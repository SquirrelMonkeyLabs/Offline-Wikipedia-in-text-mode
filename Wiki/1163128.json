 "text": "Literata is a serif typeface created by Google and designed by type designer TypeTogether. It was released in 2015 and is the font family in Google Play Books, since version 3.4.5. The goal of this typeface was to establish a unique visual identity for the Play Books application, suitable for a wide variety of screen sizes, resolutions and rendering software. Designers were inspired by Roman typefaces. Literata initially included two different weights (regular and bold) and corresponding variations in italics. In version 2.1, called Literata Book, two different weights (medium and semi-bold), small caps and height-aligned numbers were added as defaults. It includes support for Latin, polytonic Greek and full-extension Cyrillic scripts. Compared to Play Books old default font, Droid Serif, Literata has a lower x-height and higher ascenders. == References == Category:Fonts Category:Cyrillic typefaces",
