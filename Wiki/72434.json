 "text": "Chav (male) and chavette (female) are mainly negative, unkind slang words used in the United Kingdom for a subcultural stereotype of young underclass white people. Chav: \"a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothing or a baseball cap\".Collins English Dictionary They may wear fashion based on American hip-hop such as fake gold jewellery and designer clothing, combined with elements of working class British street fashion. Many are either school age or late teens/early twenties and may come from a family culture of social security claimants (\"SS claimants\"). The term first appeared in dictionaries in 2005. They tend to listen to R&B;, hip hop, UK garage, grime and reggae and drum & bass music. \"Chav\" has started to mean a variety of things. Most chavs do not wear Burberry – this happened mostly in the '90s and early '00s. Chavs are stereotypically narrow-minded and more often than not, below average intelligence. Chavs also tend to use slang language to appear \"cooler\" and more \"edgy\". Chavs may be associated with criminality, including: assault, mugging, robbery, burglary and car crime. Anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were introduced to tackle such persistent offending. “Chavette” is a term used to describe female chavs. ==Pop culture== In 2011, Owen Jones published his first book, Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class. Jones says in it that 'chav' is a word used to make working-class people seem less human. ==References== Category:British culture Category:Pejoratives Category:Slang",
