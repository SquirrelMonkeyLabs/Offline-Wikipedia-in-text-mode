Currently, the members of the group are Cha Kato, Koji Nakamoto, and Boo Takagi. However, it was originally a music band and far from owarai. It was formed as a band in 1956. The first leader was Kiyoshi Kishibe and the second leader was Teruo Sakurai. Teruo was active as a leader, but he wanted to change the band to a comic band that entertains the audience with funny lyrics and gestures rather than playing music, therefore he recommended Ikariya who was active in the other band at that time and was also focusing on owarai as the third leader. The early band members had a lot of rapid changes because there was a band transfer culture at that time. Even Ikariya didn’t understand who the early members were. Since he became the third leader, the group changed into a comic band. Additionally, he was a perfectionist, and too strict, so four members withdrew from The Drifters because they detested his teaching and comic band. After that, only Ikariya and Kato remained, and he gathered Arai, Takagi, and Nakamoto from the other band hurriedly. A new version of The Drifters was formed with them in 1964. Subsequently, the activities of the group centered on owarai. However, Arai left the group, and Shimura joined in 1974 instead of him.https://hobby.red- cm.com/tv_program_for_kids/70-80%e5%b9%b4%e4%bb%a3%e3%80%8c%e3%82%b6%e3%83%bb%e3%83%89%e3%83%aa%e3%83%95%e3%82%bf%e3%83%bc%e3%82%ba%e3%80%8d%e4%bc%9d%e8%aa%ac%e3%80%9c%e2%91%a0%e7%b5%90%e6%88%90%e3%81%8b%e3%82%89%e3%80%8c8 After becoming new members of The Drifters, there were now five total members of the group.

They played a forty-second-long opening act for the concert of The Beatles, which was popular with people all over the world. They got people’s attention because they performed not on stage for the opening act, but on the main stage. After their rise to fame, The Drifters mainly acted as comedians, but the music activities continued. === Comedy style === The Drifters created many patterns and made use of the group. There were many vulgar skits such as script-wasting food such as watermelon and milk. There were also many musical scripts. Takagi was the center of laughter in the group, but Kato became the center of comedy skits after a few months. Although the others improvised on TV, The Drifters created a completely calculated story without improvising. After Shimura joined, it changed into a comic style in which Ikaria was swayed by members of indecent roles. Shimura sometimes improvised on the stage, ignoring Ikariya’s teaching. == Television == Hachijidayo, Zen'inshugo was broadcasted on TBS from 1969 to 1985 with a total of 803 episodes.
