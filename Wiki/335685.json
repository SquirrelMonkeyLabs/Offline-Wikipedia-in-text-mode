 "text": "A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service. It allows people and companies to make their website available on the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies which provide space on a server which is owned or leased for use by clients. These clients store their Web site on the server. The server feeds the web pages to the Internet. Fandom, for example, is a hosting service. Many web hosting companies also provide other services including file hosting service. ==Classification of web hosting== === Shared web hosting === For entry-level website hosting, shared web hosting is ideal. This is where your website will be housed alongside several other websites on the same server. All domains on a shared hosting plan share the same server resources, such as RAM (Random Access Memory) and CPU (Central Processing Unit) (Central Processing Unit). Shared hosting are relatively inexpensive because all resources are shared, making them a good choice for website owners in their early stages. === Virtual Private Server (VPS Hosting) === It's the perfect solution for website owners who want greater control but don't need a dedicated server. Each website on a VPS server is housed in its own space on the server, while it still shares a physical server with other customers. While VPS hosting gives website owners more customization and storage capacity, it can't withstand extremely high traffic or usage spikes, which means that the site's performance might still be influenced by other sites on the server. === Dedicated Web Hosting === Dedicated web hosting allows website owners to have the maximum control over the server on which their website is hosted. That's because you've rented the server solely, and your website is the only one on it. This means you have complete root and admin access, allowing you to manage anything from security to the operating system you use. One of the most expensive web hosting solutions is dedicated servers. They are typically utilized by website owners who have a lot of traffic on their site and need complete control over their servers. In addition, the installation and continuing operation of the server necessitate a high level of technical competence. === Managed Web Hosting === The majority of hosting packages available online are likely to be managed. Hosting companies provide technical services such hardware and software setup and configuration, maintenance, hardware replacement, technical help, updating, and monitoring. The provider manages the hardware, operating systems, and standardized applications on a day-to-day basis using managed hosting. Each plan is tailored to the demands of various groups, so knowing what you need in a website will help you choose the best plan for you and your company. Category:Internet",
