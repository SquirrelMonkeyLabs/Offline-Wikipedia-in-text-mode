He painted pictures of the end of the world and events from the Bible. The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was the last painting that Martin finished. He completed it in 1852 and sent it to the Royal Academy. In 1853 he started to paint The Last Judgment, The Great Day of His Wrath, and The Plains of Heaven, but he became sick. He died the next year. The painting shows the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah from the Bible. The picture shows Lot and his two daughters running from the city. Lot's wife looked back and became a pillar of salt. The painting has a red color and a storm in the sky, typical of Martin's work.https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022311/39B5610BCC0B380CF1834FECCE2261E54C3F8914.html The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is in the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle, England. == References == Category:1850s paintings",
