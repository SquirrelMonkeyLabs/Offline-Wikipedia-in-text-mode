 "text": "Chechnya (; ), officially the Chechen Republic (; ), is a federal subject in Russia. It is located in the Caucasus region of Western Asia. The capital is Grozny. Most people in Chechnya are Muslims and are of ancient Hurrian roots who spoke a Caucasian language. Most Chechens belong to the Shafi`i school of Sunni Islam. Chechens speak their own language, not related to the Russian language. The Chechen language is part of the Northeast Caucasian, or Vainakh, family, while Russian is a Slavic language. During Soviet control, Chechnya was unified with Ingushetia. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Chechnya broke away from Ingushetia to form its own republic. The Chechens wanted independence. After the First Chechen War, Chechnya was de facto independent as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. After the Second Chechen War, Russia regained control of Chechnya. Russia has claimed Chechnya as part of its country since the Russians invaded the Caucasus in the 18th century. The current leader of the Chechen Republic is Ramzan Kadyrov. He is also the son of the 1st Chechen President, Akhmad Kadyrov. == References == == Other websites == * Official site of the Republic of Chechnya Category:Federal subjects of Russia Category:Republics of Russia",
