 "text": "The Peak Forest Canal is a narrow (7-foot gauge) canal in northern England. It is 14.8 miles (23.8 km) long. There is a flight of 16 locks that raise the canal by 209 feet (64 m) over the course of 1 mile. It was opened in 1800. It goes from Dukinfield in Tameside, where it joins the Ashton Canal and crosses the River Goyt at Marple where it meets the Macclesfield Canal. It goes on to the Bugsworth Basin in Derbyshire. The Peak Forest Tramway, which was 6 miles (9.7 km) long was used to bring limestone down from the quarries. There is a short branch to the centre of Whaley Bridge. By the early 1960s it was in a very poor state but it has been restored. ==References== Category:Canals in England Category:Buildings and structures in Derbyshire Category:Buildings and structures in Greater Manchester",
