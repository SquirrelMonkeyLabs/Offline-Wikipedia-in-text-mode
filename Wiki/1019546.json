 "text": "Hydrogen vehicles are cars that use hydrogen gas as a source of fuel. They are one of the cleanest forms of transportation. Hydrogen vehicles use a fuel cell stack in order to convert the hydrogen energy to power an electric motor. ==Process== # Hydrogen gas is stored inside a high-pressure tank located within the vehicle. # The hydrogen is given to the fuel cell stack, which is made of an anode, cathode, and electrolyte. # Hydrogen molecules from the storage tanks are introduced into the anode compartment of each fuel cell. # The hydrogen molecules then usually encounter a catalyst, which splits the hydrogen molecules into protons, labeled \"H+,” and electrons, labeled \"e-.”. # The protons move through the proton exchange membrane, while the electrons are forced to use an external circuit because the proton exchange membrane is very selective. # While the electrons flow through the external circuit, this creates an electrical current, and this will power the electric motor found in the vehicle. This process ends up leaving behind only water. This means that we are able to assure that Hydrogen vehicles will not produce anything that will harm the environment nor use non-renewable resources aside from the transportation of the Hydrogen needed to power the vehicle. == Issues == Hydrogen vehicles lack proper infrastructure, because hydrogen fueling stations can cost more than $1,000,000. Additionally, the vehicles are expensive, because using hydrogen as fuel is a new concept. Category:Transport",
