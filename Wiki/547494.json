Her novel Les vaisseaux du cœur, published in 1988, was called pornographic by some because of its explicit sexual depictions. It was filmed by Andrew Birkin in 1992 as Salt on Our Skin. In April 2010, she became Commander of the Légion d'honneur.Le Figaro ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2016 deaths Category:French journalists Category:Writers from Paris Category:French feminists",
