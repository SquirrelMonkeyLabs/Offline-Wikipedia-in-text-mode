 "text": "Death by burning (also known as immolation) is an execution method involving combustion or touching to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of capital punishment. Many societies have used it as punishment for crimes such as treason, heresy and witchcraft. The best known execution of this type is burning at the stake where the condemned is tied to a big wooden stake and a fire lit under them. Macrophage cells accumulate at the site of the burn. Macrophages in turn stimulate the production of cytokines, TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor), reactive nitrogen intermediates, and interleukins-6. Macrophages undergo phagocytosis of damaged cells and cellular debris. TNF- alpha induces apoptosis of damaged cells. ==Other websites== * CapitalPunishmentUK.org * List of deaths by fire throughout history Category:Fire Category:Torture Category:Capital punishment",
