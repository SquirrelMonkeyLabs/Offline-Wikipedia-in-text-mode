 "text": "Marian Lois Robinson (née Shields; July 30, 1937 - May 31, 2024) was the mother of Michelle Obama and mother-in-law of President Barack Obama. She was the last living grandparent of Malia and Sasha Obama. She also has one granddaughter, Leslie Robinson, and two grandsons, Avery and Austin Robinson, from her son, Craig Robinson. According to her youngest brother Steve Shields, Robinson was the fourth of seven children—five girls, followed by two boys. Her father was a house painter and her mother was a licensed practical nurse. Robinson married Fraser Robinson on October 27, 1960. She is now a widow. In addition to their daughter Michelle, they also had a son, Craig. Craig is the current coach of the Oregon State University men's basketball team. Robinson was formerly a secretary for mail-order retailer Spiegel and at a bank. While Michelle and Barack Obama campaigned in 2008, Robinson cared for her granddaughters. Early in January 2009, it was reported that Robinson would move into the White House with the rest of the First Family (the president's family), so that she could continue to care for her granddaughters. She was the first grandmother to live in the White House since Elivera M. Doud during the Eisenhower administration. Some news agencies have called Robinson the \"First Granny.\" Robinson died on May 31, 2024 in Chicago, aged 86. == References == == Other websites == * \"Marian Robinson\", The New York Times * \"A Mother's Love: First Lady & Mom\" , Essence magazine * \"An In-Law Is Finding Washington to Her Liking \", The New York Times Category:1937 births Category:2024 deaths Category:African-American people Category:Obama family Category:People from Chicago",
