 "text": "Hyloxalus leucophaeus is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 25.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 26.1 mm long. This frog has disks on the toes of all four feet for climbing. The skin of the frog's back is gray-brown in color. The skin of the sides is light gray-brown in color. The legs are dull brown with darker brown stripes. There are stripes over the ear that are brown-black in color. There is a cream-white stripe near where the legs meet the body. There is a light gray stripe on the back of each back leg. The belly is white in color. There is some yellow color on the throat and the bottoms of the legs. The iris of the eye is brown in color The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in exactly one place, 2400 meters above sea level in the both in the Cordillera Central. They saw it near a stream in a place where animals eat grass. Scientists think this frog is good at living in places that people have changed. ==Young== Scientists think that the female frog lays her eggs on land because that is what other frogs in Hyloxalus do. They have seen large tadpoles swimming in the water. At one part of its life, the tadpole is 15.6 mm long without the tail and 37.5 mm long with the tail. It has small eyes on the top of its head. The tadpole is dark gray in color. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists saw eight frogs, both adults and young frogs, and some small tadpoles. They saw these animals in 1989. Scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis may have killed many of these frogs because it has killed other frogs nearby. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
