 "text": "In statistical physics, Glauber dynamics is a way to simulate the Ising model (a model of magnetism) on a computer. It is a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. == The algorithm == In the Ising model, we have say N particles that can spin up (+1) or down (-1). Say the particles are on a 2D grid. We label each with an x and y coordinate. Glauber's algorithm becomes: # Choose a particle \\sigma_{x,y} at random. # Sum its four neighboring spins. S = \\sigma_{x+1,y} + \\sigma_{x-1,y} + \\sigma_{x,y+1} + \\sigma_{x,y-1}. # Compute the change in energy if the spin x, y were to flip. This is \\Delta E = 2\\sigma_{x, y} S (see the Hamiltonian for the Ising model). # If \\Delta E < 0 flip the spin. That is if flipping reduces the energy, then do it. # Else flip the spin with probability e^{-\\Delta E/T} where T is the temperature. # Display the new grid. Repeat the above N times. This tries to approximate how the spins change over time. The fancy term is that it is part of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which roughly studies the time-dependent behavior of statistical mechanics. == History == The algorithm is named after Roy J. Glauber, Nobel Prize winner and a Harvard physicist who worked at Los Alamos. == Related pages == * Metropolis algorithm * Ising model * Monte Carlo algorithm * Simulated annealing == References == Category:Subfields of physics",
