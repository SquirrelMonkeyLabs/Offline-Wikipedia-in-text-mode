 "text": "A corpus cavernosum penis (singular) (from Latin, characterised by \"cavities/ hollows\" of the penis, : corpora cavernosa) is one of two sponge-like sections of tissue in the male penis. They contain most of the blood during an erection in the penis of several animals during an erection. The term literally means \"cave-like body\" It is homologous to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis in the female. == Process == The corpus cavernosum are placed along the length of the penis. They are found along the penis shaft, from the pubic bones to the head of the penis. The spongy tissue fills with blood. The blood comes from arteries down the length of the penis. The blood fills the corpora cavernosa. This causes it to swell. When swollen, it holds 90% of the blood involved in an erection. This increases both the length and circumference of the penis. Blood can leave only through a system of veins around the outside wall of the corpus cavernosum. The expanding tissue constricts these veins. This preventing blood from leaving. The penis becomes rigid as a result. == Medical procedures == To reverse an erection that has gone on too long (such as when using viagra, the corpus cavernosum can be used to lower the penis by drawing blood out from it. This is done with a needle. If it fails to lower the penis, then sterile saline water is sometimes injected into the penis on one side with a needle on the other, which takes the water back out. ==References== ==Other websites== * - \"The Male Perineum and the Penis: Penis\" Category:Penis Category:Male reproductive system",
