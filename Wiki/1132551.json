 "text": "Kickball is a team sport and league game that is like baseball. Like baseball, it has one team trying to score by having its players return a ball from home base to the field and then circle the bases. Meanwhile, the other team tries to stop them by tagging them \"out\" with the ball before they can return to home base. However, instead of hitting a small hard ball with a bat, players kick a usually rubber ball. ==References== Category:Team sports",
