Wylad turns into his true form as a monster. He almost kills Guts and Griffith, but they are saved by Nosferatu Zodd. When Wylad does, he is sucked into a vortex and his original body as a little old man is revealed. They learn that the king's torture removed Griffith's tongue and many of the muscles he needs to fight. After seeing a vision, Griffith tries to run away from camp. He falls down and finds the Behelit again. As the band get close to him, the moon begins begins to cover the sun and starts a solar eclipse. The band are trapped inside the eclipse. Four giant demons appear and Griffith is grabbed by a gigantic hand as the rest of the band are attacked by demons. Griffith sacrifices everyone in the eclipse so he can become the fifth member of the \"God Hand\". Judeau and Pippin die protecting Casca. Guts goes into a fit of rage, but he can't protect Casca from the demons. Griffith, now reborn as Femto, rapes Casca. Guts cuts off his left arm to escape a demon, but he is pinned down and can't do anything. The Skull Knight breaks into the eclipse to save Guts and Casca, but everyone else from the Band of the Hawk die except Rickert, the youngest one who was waiting outside. Guts wakes up 4 days later in the cave of the blacksmith Godot. Casca has lost all her memories, she does not know who Guts is and cannot speak. Guts runs away until night time, when he is attacked by spirits. The Skull Knight tells him that he was marked for sacrifice during the eclipse and will be attacked by the spirits every night. Guts finds Casca giving birth to his child, which has been possessed by evil and deformed by Femto's rape.
