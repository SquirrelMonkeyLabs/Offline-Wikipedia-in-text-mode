Non-nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy (Cambridge, Mass.: Ballinger Publishing Company, 1975. xxxii + 223pp. , ). The book says that the nuclear power debate is not about technical disputes but relates to different personal views (personal values). The personal values that make a high-energy society work are all too apparent, and the values associated with an alternate view relate to thrift, simplicity, diversity, neighbourliness, craftsmanship, and humility.Non-Nuclear Futures, pp. xix-xxi. Lovins and Price say that these two different sets of personal values lead to two very different policy paths relating to future energy supplies. The first is high- energy nuclear, centralized, electric; the second is lower energy, non- nuclear, decentralized, less electrified, softer technology.Non-Nuclear Futures, p. xxiii. ==Related pages== *Anti-nuclear movement *Nuclear-free zone *Rocky Mountain Institute *The Clean Tech Revolution ==References== Category:Books about nuclear issues Category:1975 books",
