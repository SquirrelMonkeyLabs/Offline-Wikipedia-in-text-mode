It is one of England's most visited tourist sites. At Runnymede, King John sealed Magna Carta in 1215. Over eight centuries later, the memorial for those of the Allied Air Forces who died in World War II was placed on Runnymede. The British memorial to John F. Kennedy was put there in 1965. == History == The name Runnymede may be derived from the Anglo- Saxon 'runieg' (regular meeting) and 'mede' (mead or meadow), describing a place in the meadows used to hold regular meetings. The Witan,Council of the Anglo-Saxon Kings of the 7th to 11th centuries the Saxon Council, was held from time to time at Runnymede during the reign of Alfred the Great. The Council met usually in the open air, a tradition that influenced the creation of the English Parliament in the 13th century. == Kennedy Memorial == Visitors reach the memorial by treading a steep path of irregular granite steps, intended to symbolise a pilgrimage. There are 50 steps in total. Each step is different to all others, with the entire flight made from 60,000 hand-cut granite blocks. The landscape architect Geoffrey Jellicoe designed the garden; the sculptor Alan Collins designed and carved the stone inscription. The round on which the memorial is situated was given as a gift to the United States by the British people. It is maintained by the Kennedy Memorial Trust, which also sponsors educational scholarships for British students to attend university in the United States. In 1968, the 7-ton stone was damaged by a bomb during a time of demonstrations against the Vietnam War; it was later repaired by the sculptor. == References == Category:Geography of Surrey Category:Tourism Category:National Trust properties",
