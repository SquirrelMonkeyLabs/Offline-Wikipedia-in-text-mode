Although individual sports such as golf, tennis, auto racing, and gymnastics are also very popular, the term is usually limited to team sports. The term \"major league\" was first used in 1921 in reference to Major League Baseball (MLB), the top level of professional American baseball. Today, the major northern North America professional team sports leagues are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Other notable leagues include Major League Soccer (MLS), the Canadian Football League (CFL), the Arena Football League, Major League Lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League, Professional Lacrosse League and the Women's National Basketball Association.
