 "text": "Approximation theory is a field of mathematics which is concerned with approximating the values of a function. Usually, the approximation is only needed for a range of values or domain. A good approximation will only have a small error in the domain of interest. There are different ways in which this approximation is done: common ones are using a combination of simpler functions or using polynomials. == Related pages == *Curve fitting *Rounding *Taylor series ==Further reading== * Trefethen, L.
