The river starts at about west of Viamaggio (comune of Pieve Santo Stefano) and about southwest of the comune of Badia Tedalda, in the province of Arezzo (Tuscany), in the Alpe della Luna at an elevation of above sea level. At about to the northeast of Badia Tedalda, the river flows into the Emilia-Romagna region, in the Casteldelci comune, province of Rimini. Then it flows through Ca 'Raffaello, an exclave of Badia Tedalda; to the north of here, the Senatello river flows into the Marecchia as a left tributary. Later, in Ponte Masa, the Masa river flows from the right into the Marecchia. Shortly after Torello, the San Marino river flows as a right tributary and, after the Verucchio comune, the Ausa flows also from the right. Between the frazioni (Italian subdivisions of a municipality) of Rivabella and San Giuliano, in Rimini, the Marecchia river ends in the Adriatic Sea. The Bridge of Tiberius () or Bridge of Augustus () is a Roman bridge in Rimini. Its construction began in the times of Augustus but was finished in 20 AD in the times of Tiberius. ==Main tributaries == The tributaries of the Marecchia river are: Left tributaries: * Senatello Right tributaries: * Massa * San Marino * Ausa ==Gallery== File:Foce del fiume Marecchia a Rimini (2013).jpg|Mouth of Marecchia in Rimini File:Rimini grattacielo.jpg|The Marecchia river in Rimini File:Tiberius-Br√ºcke.JPG|The bridge of Tiberius across the Marecchia in Rimini File:099014858-MIBAC Sara Bonvicini.jpg|The bridge of Tiberius at night ==Related pages== * List of rivers of Italy ==References== ==Other websites== * Fiume italiani: Fiume Malrecchia Category:Rivers of Italy Category:Emilia-Romagna Category:Tuscany",
