 "text": "Gunther's wrinkled ground frog (Platymantis guentheri) is a frog. It lives in rainforests in the Great Mindanao Islands in the Philippines. People have seen it as high as 700 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 24 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 27 mm long. The skin has bumps on it. Its head and nose are narrow. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks on its front feet are larger than the ones on its back feet. The skin on the frog's back is dark in color with marks. There is a stripe down its side. Its belly is light and can have brown spots. This frog lives in ferns that grow on tree branches, in tree trunks, and on the ground in the forest. It can live in some places that humans have changed. The female frog leaves eggs in water in plants or leaves. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They are never tadpoles. This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than their were because human beings change the places where they live. For example, humans cut down forests to get wood for building and to make farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
