 "text": "Northwestern Bell is the name for an American Midwestern telephone company. The network was doing business as US West beginning in 1987 or 1988. It was merged in 1991. It stopped business in the late summer 1994. It was operated in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. The company began as Nebraska Telephone Company and Iowa Telephone Company. In December 1920, these and three other telephone groups were merged into one company and renamed Northwestern Bell Telephone Company. When the Bell System was phased out, it was renamed to Northwestern Bell a US WEST Company. In the early-to- mid 1990s, the Northwestern Bell name and company stopped being used. It was replaced under the US West Communications company banner. In 2010 or 2011, CenturyLink took over Northwestern Bell and the operations. At that same time, CenturyLink replaced the Qwest name. However, according to CenturyLink and some other sources, there are the chances of Northwestern Bell being revived one day. In fact, there is the domain www.northwesternbell.com. This web connects to CenturyLink/Lumen Technologies on the internet. Also in the early 1990s, US West began licensing the Northwestern Bell name onto landline and mobile phones from the La Phone brand as BELL Phones by Northwestern Bell (Southwestern Bell and BellSouth had already done similar earlier). == Other websites == ==References== Category:Companies based in Nebraska Category:Companies based in Iowa Category:1920 establishments in the United States Category:1994 disestablishments in the United States Category:Defunct companies Category:American telephone companies Category:Companies based in Minnesota",
