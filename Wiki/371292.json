 "text": "A commemorative plaque, or simply plaque, is a plate made of metal, ceramic, stone, wood, or other material. It is usually placed on a wall or a large stone. It usually has text and sometimes an image in memory of one or more persons, as used for epitaph, an event, a former use of the place, or some other thing. A plaquette is a small plaque. The word plaquette is not usually used for outdoor plaques fixed to wall. ==United Kingdom== In England there is the Blue Plaques scheme. Plaques are put on to buildings to commemorate their links with important people or events. The scheme has been run by English Heritage for over 140 years and is thought to be the oldest of its kind in the world. Other commemorative plaque schemes are run by local councils and charities throughout the United Kingdom. These use their own rules for deciding when to put up a plaque. A list of schemes in England can be found on the English Heritage website. ==Theft== As the price of scrap metal has increased plaques have been stolen by thieves wishing to sell the metal for cash. ==Awards== Plaques or, more often, plaquettes, have text awarding someone or something. ==Examples== Image:6208-PointLomaCabrilloCommemorativePlaque.jpg|Plaque at Cabrillo National Monument, Point Loma, near San Diego, CA File:Hong Kong Park Plaque.jpg|The plaque in the Hong Kong Park commemorating the park's opening by the Governor of Hong Kong in 1991 Image:Dickson library plaque ACT.jpg|An example of a plaque in Canberra, Australia File:Wolverhampton Borough Council Coat of Arms.jpg|Plaque showing the historical coat of arms of Wolverhampton, England before 1898 File:Dorset Obelisk.jpg|Second World War memorial plaque ==References== ==Other websites== * History of the First World War bronze memorial plaques * WW I memorial plaques history * Gallery of Commemorative Plaques carved by lettercutter Ieuan Rees * Blue Plaque Scheme: English Heritage * Open Plaques - list of commemorative plaques in UK and elsewhere",
