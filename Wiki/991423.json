 "text": "A forb is a plant with broad leaves, flowers, and no woody stem. Forbs are herbaceous plants because their stems are green and soft, not woody. Many familiar plants are forbs, such as sunflowers, clovers, and melons. Forbs are not a grouping used in taxonomy, because some forbs are more closely related to other plants than they are to each other. All herbaceous flowering plants are forbs except grasses, sedges, and rushes. == References == Category:Types of plants",
