This charge is based on the 2005 allegations of a January 2004 incident. He was released on a $1 million dollar bail later that day. In 2014, Cosby was set to release his new standup special Bill Cosby 77 on Netflix. The release of the film was canceled due to allegations of sexual assault against Cosby. Cosby's trial started on June 5, 2017. He was found guilty of three counts of assault on April 26, 2018, and was sentenced to 3–10 years in prison in late September 2018. He used lawyer Thomas Mesereau. Cosby got out of prison on 30 June 2021, because the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found that the justice system had made a mistake in the process of convicting him. In 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States decided to not hear the case about Cosby getting out of prison.https://direkte.vg.no/nyhetsdognet/news/hoeyesterett-avviste-cosby- anke.mRijPwHC2?utm_source=vgfront&utm;_content=hovedlopet_row14_pos1.
