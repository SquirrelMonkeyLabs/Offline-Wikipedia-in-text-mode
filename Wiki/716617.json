 "text": "Phillip James Edwin Peebles (born April 25, 1935) is a Canadian-American physicist and theoretical cosmologist. He is currently the Albert Einstein Professor Emeritus of Science at Princeton University. Peebles was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019 for his theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology. In November 2019, Peebles noted, in his award presentation, that he does not support the Big Bang Theory, due to the lack of concrete supporting evidence, and stated, \"It's very unfortunate that one thinks of the beginning whereas in fact, we have no good theory of such a thing as the beginning.\" ==References== Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Canadian physicists Category:American physicists Category:People from Winnipeg Category:Princeton University faculty",
