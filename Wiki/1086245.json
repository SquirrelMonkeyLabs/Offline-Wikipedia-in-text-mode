 "text": "Rodat (Jawi: رودات) is a traditional dance from Indonesia and Malaysia that probably came from the Middle East. Traders from Aceh brought it to Southeast Asia in the early 1800s. Rodat is performed by both men and women. It became popular at events like harvest festivals, Mawlid, and the Sultan's birthday. The dance's name comes from \"hadrat Baghdad\", which means songs that praise Allah and Prophet Muhammad. During a Rodat performance, singers say 8 to 12 verses from the Kitab Zikir, a book filled with advice and life lessons. Male and female chorus groups take turns singing, accompanied by the rhythm of the Rebana drum. Usually, there are 20 to 26 performers, including 12 male dancers, eight drummers, and four to six female dancers. The dance involves sitting, kneeling, squatting, and standing movements. == Performance == During the Rodat dance, people wear traditional Malay clothes in many colors. They put on black velvet hats called Songkoks. Near the stage are four children; two of them dressed as princesses and two as Princes, all wearing cotton stockings. The rest of the audience sits on the ground. The conductor tells the orchestra to start, and the audience becomes quiet. Dancers, with one knee on the ground, start moving their hands in time with the music. The orchestra plays a slow, rhythmic tune while the dancers say verses without moving much. As the music goes on, the dancers begin to sway and move their hands more. After a few verses, they stand up and go towards the orchestra, making an impressive sight under the stage lights. As the orchestra plays, the dancers sway gracefully and move their feet to the rhythm. They bend their arms smoothly, moving gently from side to side. Throughout their performance, they move with smoothness, showing their skill and finesse. In the Rodat dance, dancers move their arms and feet slowly. Each verse is sung slowly, different from the fast and lively chorus. Drummers focus on playing energetic rhythms. One part of the dance can last for up to fifteen minutes. After a break, the orchestra starts a new tune, and the chorus leader sings a romantic song. Four children enter with bells around their ankles and dance gracefully while the chorus sings along, swaying gently. When the song ends, the child dancers go back to their seats. Then, the orchestra begins a Islamic religious chant, and the dancers perform graceful movements. This pattern of religious and non- religious music usually continues late into the night. == References == Category:Dances of Indonesia Dances",
