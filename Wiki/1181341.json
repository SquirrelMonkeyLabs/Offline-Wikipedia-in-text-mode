However, the coalition lost the election. The coalition aimed to field a single candidate in each of Hungary’s 106 electoral districts to challenge the Fidesz-KDNP candidate. If victorious, they planned to govern together based on a jointly agreed program and principles. == Members == In 2021, Péter Márki-Zay became the joint prime ministerial candidate of the Unity for Hungary coalition. As a result, his party, the Everybody’s Hungary People’s Party, was considered part of the alliance, along with other smaller parties.
