 "text": "The President of Austria is the federal head of state of Austria. Even though the constitution says the President has a lot of power, in practice the President is mostly a figurehead. The President of Austria is elected once in every six years. His or her offices are in the Leopoldine Wing of the Hofburg Imperial Palace, in Vienna. Many former Presidents have had a lot of popularity while in office. No incumbent has ever lost a bid for re-election. Since 2017 the President has been Alexander Van der Bellen. This is a list of Presidents of Austria since the establishment of that office in 1919. ==List of officeholders (1919–present)== President Portrait Term of office Party Karl Seitz 5 March 1919 21 October 1919 Social Democratic Workers' Party Karl Seitz 21 October 1919 9 December 1920 Social Democratic Workers' Party Michael Hainisch 9 December 1920 9 December 1924 Non-partisan 9 December 1924 10 December 1928 Wilhelm Miklas 10 December 1928 1 May 1934 Christian Social Party Fatherland Front Wilhelm Miklas 1 May 1934 10 December 1934 Fatherland Front 10 December 1934 13 March 1938 Arthur Seyss-Inquart 13 March 1938 National Socialist German Workers' Party Austria annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.
