She is known for playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movie series alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. Outside of Harry Potter, she has acted in several other movies.

As late as 2019, Watson performed in the film adaption of Little Women, playing Meg. She is also an activist for gender equality. ==Early life and education== Emma Watson was born on 15 April 1990 in Paris, France to English parents Chris Watson and Jacqueline Luesby. (click appropriate actor's image, click \"Actor Bio\") Watson lived in Maisons-Laffitte near Paris until the age of five. Her parents divorced when she was young, and Watson moved to England to live with her mother in Oxfordshire while spending weekends at her father's house in London. Watson has said she speaks some French, though \"not as well\" as she used to. After moving to Oxford with her mother and brother, she attended the Dragon School, remaining there until 2003. From age six, she wanted to become an actress, and trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing, and acting. == Family == Emma Watson is the daughter of Chris and Jacqueline Watson. She has one brother, Alex, as well as one stepbrother, Toby, and two stepsisters, Lucy and Nina. == Fashion == As Watson has grown older, she has become more interested in fashion. She says that she thinks fashion is like art, which she studied in school. In September 2008, she told a blogger, \"I've been focusing on art a lot, and fashion's a great extension of that.\" In 2008, the British news reported that Watson was going to be the model for the fashion house Chanel instead of Keira Knightley, but both Watson and Knightley said that this was not true. In June 2009, Watson said that she would be helping Burberry by being a part of their new Autumn/Winter 2009 collection. She was later a part of Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign with her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and Max Hurd. ==Filmography== Year Film Role Notes 2001 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hermione Granger Released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US and India Nominated for Best Performance by a Young Actor Saturn Award Nominated for Best Debut at Empire Awards Nominated for Best Youth Performance PFCS Award Won Best Performance in a Feature Film – Leading Young Actress Young Artist Award 2002 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Nominated for Best Youth Performance PFCS Award 2004 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Nominated for Best Young Actress Critics Choice Award 2005 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Nominated for Best Young Actress Critics Choice Award Nominated for Best On-screen Actress MTV Movie Award 2007 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Nominated for Best Actress at Empire Awards Won Best Performance by a Female National Movie Award Ballet Shoes Pauline Fossil Television movie shown on BBC One 2008 The Tale of Despereaux Princess Pea Voice part 2009 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Hermione Granger Nominated for Best Actress Scream Award 2010/2011 A two part movie. 2011 The Perks of Being a Wallflower Sam 2011 My Week with Marilyn Lucy 2013 This Is the End Emma Watson 2014 Noah Ila 2015 The Vicar of Dibley Reverend Iris 2015 Colonia Lena 2015 Regression Angela Gray 2017 Beauty and the Beast Belle Real life Disney adaptation of the Disney adaptation, “Beauty and the Beast”, based on the novel Belle et la Bete, by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve, published in 1740 2017 The Circle Mae Holland 2019 Little Women Meg Real life movie adaptation of the book “Little Women” by Louisa May Alcott == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Actors from Paris Category:British feminists Category:English activists Category:English child actors Category:English models Category:English movie actors Category:English television actors Category:English voice actors",
