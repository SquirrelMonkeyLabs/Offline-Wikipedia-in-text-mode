He is best known for his supporting role as Erlich Bachman in the television sitcom Silicon Valley until he left the show in 2018. His first role in a movie was Cloverfield, in which he played the character who videotaped most of the scenes. ==Controversy== On December 9, 2016, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting an Uber driver in Los Angeles. In 2017, a woman claimed that Miller had sexually assaulted her at George Washington University in 2001. Miller denied the claims and called the accused a \"vindictive former member of a comedy troupe\". Dreamworks dropped Miller from How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and recast his character Tuffnut Thorston. On April 9, 2018, Miller was arrested for LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York after he called in a fake bomb threat onboard an Amtrak train on March 18. Authorities said Miller was very intoxicated and verbally fighting a woman. His charges were dropped and then dismissed. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Denver Category:American stand-up comedians Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American voice actors Category:Comedians from Denver",
