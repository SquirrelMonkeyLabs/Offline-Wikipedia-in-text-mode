 "text": "Hadaka no tsukai is an idea in Japanese culture. It is the idea of spending time together naked. Hadaka no tsukai friendships are not sexual. They are platonic. A family, a group of housewives from the same neighborhood, a group of businessmen, or a group of classmates might spend time together naked at a sent≈ç bathhouse, at an onsen hot spring, or at a health club. This makes them feel like a group. ==References== Category:Japanese customs",
