He is best known for his work as Finn the Human from the American animated television series Adventure Time. ==Biography== Jeremy Shada began acting at the age of seven soon after moving to Los Angeles with his family. He was inspired to act by his older brother Zack Shada, who had begun acting himself. Shada initially appeared in commercials. Later on, he began auditioning for voice acting and theatrical performances, taking the advice from a voice over agent. His first live action theatrical role was as Young Kurt Diamond in No Rules. He has since appeared in additional live action and voice acting roles, such as playing Charlie Pace in childhood flashbacks on Lost. In 2009, Jeremy Shada's agent approached him with the idea of auditioning for the role of Finn. Both recognized that Zack Shada had been the original voice of Finn in the pilot episode of Adventure Time three years before. After viewing the pilot on YouTube, Shada matched his voice with the voice of Zack Shada in auditions with Adventure Time's creator Pendleton Ward and the show's producers, earning him the Finn role. In 2012, Shada joined the cast of Nick Cannon's comedy sketch Incredible Crew. In June 2012, to promote Incredible Crew's 2013 premiere, Cartoon Network released a music rap video titled \"Running Errands with My Mom\" which features Shada performing and rapping the lyric. The video has since generated over one million views. Because of his acting schedule, Shada was homeschooled. Answering fan questions on his Facebook page, Shada indicated that he graduated from high school early in May 2013. ==Filmography== Film Film Film Film Year Film Role Notes Miracle Run Young Phillip TV movie Team America: World Police Jean Francois Voice No Rules Young Kurt Diamond My Neighbors the Yamadas Additional voices Southern Comfort Colton TV movie Love's Unending Legacy Boy in Stagecoach Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Additional Voices ParaNorman Pug Voice Cartoon Network 20th Anniversary Finn Voice (TV movie) Aliens in the House Mikey TV movie (Completed) Jobs Daniel Kottke Television Television Television Television Year Television Role Notes Batman: The Brave and the Bold Young Robin Voice Adventure Time Finn, additional voices Incredible Crew Main role/Various characters Actor Guest appearances Guest appearances Guest appearances Guest appearances Year Title Role Episodes ER Bobby \"Time of Death\" Good Girls Don't Young David \"Sole Mates\" Nip/Tuck Kid #1 \"Reefer\" Lost Young Charlie Pace \"Fire + Water\", \"Greatest Hits\" Shark C.J.
