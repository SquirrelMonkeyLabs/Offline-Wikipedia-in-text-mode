 "text": "Wave speed is a wave property which may mean only one of several things: which may refer to absolute value of: *phase velocity, the velocity at which a wave phase propagates at a certain frequency. *group velocity, the propagation velocity for the envelope of wave groups and often of wave energy. This is different from the phase velocity for dispersive waves. *signal velocity, or information velocity, which is the velocity at which a wave carries information. *front velocity, the velocity at which the first rise of a pulse above zero moves forward.",
