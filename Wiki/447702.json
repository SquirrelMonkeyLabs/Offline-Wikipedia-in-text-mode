 "text": "PAX (originally named Penny Arcade Expo) is a series of gaming festivals. It is held in Seattle, Washington (PAX Prime, PAX Dev), Boston, Massachusetts (PAX East), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PAX Unplugged), and Melbourne, Victoria (PAX Aus). The festival was created by Penny Arcade authors Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik in 2004. They created it because they wanted to attend a show that would give equal attention to console gamers, computer gamers, and tabletop gamers. Since its creation, the event has grown to become very popular; it is widely considered one of the most important events to the video gaming community. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website Category:Video game events Category:2004 establishments in the United States",
