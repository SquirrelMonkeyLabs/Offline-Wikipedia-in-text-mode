 "text": "Robert Skinner Boyd (January 11, 1928 â€“ September 20, 2019) was an American journalist. He was born in Chicago. He spent most of his career working for the Knight Newspaper Group. He and Clark Hoyt won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for discovering the fact that Senator Thomas Eagleton, George McGovern's choice for vice president, had had severe psychiatric problems and undergone three shock treatments. Instead of publishing their scoop, they told their findings to McGovern's top advisor, and Eagleton withdrew as the Democratic nominee. Boyd died from congestive heart failure at a nursing home in Philadelphia on September 20, 2019 at the age of 91. ==References== Category:Pulitzer Prize winners Category:1928 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from congestive heart failure Category:Harvard University alumni Category:20th- century American novelists Category:Journalists from Chicago Category:Writers from Chicago",
