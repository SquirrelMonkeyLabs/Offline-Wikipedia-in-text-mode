It was response to the AIDS crisis as many artists also died of AIDS. The day coincides with World AIDS Day, which began the year before. 800 U.S. art and AIDS groups participated in the first Day Without Art. Museums were sending staff to volunteer at AIDS services, or sponsoring special exhibitions of work about AIDS. Day With(out) Art grew in collaborations to estimated 8,000 national and international museums, galleries, art centers, AIDS service organizations, libraries, high schools and colleges take part. New York group called \"Visual AIDS\" (now NGO), initiated public actions and programs, published an annual poster and copyright-free broadsides, and acted as press coordinator and clearing house for projects for Day Without Art/World AIDS Day. Day With(out) Art highlights art projects by artists living with HIV/AIDS, and art about AIDS, that were taking place around the world. In 2014, the Los Angeles art collective, My Barbarian, staged a video performance in remembrance of Pedro Zamora, inspired by the queer theorist, José Esteban Muñoz's theory of counterpublicity. In 2020, due to pandemic VisualAIDS organized online programming featuring commissioned diverse video works from different parts of the world and talks to authors. Programing was done in multiple languages and done both in in NYC and around the world at different times in different timezones with different partner organizations. ==References== ==Other websites== * VisualAIDS.org: official Day Without Art website * http://www.thebody.com/visualaids/dwa/dwa2006.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20080908013708/http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/2005/winter/feature3.html Category:1989 establishments Category:LGBT events Category:HIV/AIDS Category:Art exhibitions Category:December observances",
