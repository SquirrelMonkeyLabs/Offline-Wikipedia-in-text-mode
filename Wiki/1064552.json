 "text": "Full Gear (2023) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on November 18, 2023 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California. It was the fifth Full Gear event held by AEW. The main event of the show saw MJF defeat Jay White to keep the AEW World Championship. After MJF left the arena in an ambulance after suffering an injury during the pre-show match, Adam Cole said that he would defend MJF's AEW World Championship for him. Before the match started, MJF drove the ambulance back to the arena and decided to defend the title himself. When the referee was distracted, MJF hit White with his Dynamite Diamond Ring and pinned him to win the match and keep his title. Another notable match was a bloody and violent Texas Death match between \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Swerve Strickland. There was some controversy in the match for a spot where Page stapled his son's drawing to Strickland's face, ripped it off and then drank Strickland's blood before spitting it into the air. Strickland won the match after wrapping a chain around Page's neck and hanging him until Page passed out. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter rated the match 5 stars out of 5. Before the event, AEW owner Tony Khan said that he would be announcing a major signing for the company. During the event, it was announced that Will Ospreay had signed a contract to become a member of the AEW roster. Ospreay became a member after finishing up his contract with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in February 2024. ==Matches== No. Results Stipulations Times 1 Eddie Kingston (c) defeated Jay Lethal (with Jeff Jarrett, Karen Jarrett, Satnam Singh, and Sonjay Dutt) Singles match for the ROH World Championship 10:55 2 Claudio Castagnoli defeated Buddy Matthews by submission Singles match 10:30 3 MJF (c) and Samoa Joe defeated The Gunns (Austin Gunn and Colten Gunn) Tag team match for the ROH World Tag Team Championship (Joe filled in for an injured Adam Cole) 9:25 4 Sting, Darby Allin, and Adam Copeland (with Ric Flair) defeated The Patriarchy (Christian Cage, Luchasaurus, and Nick Wayne) Six-man tag team match 15:10 5 Orange Cassidy (c) (with Hook) defeated Jon Moxley (with Wheeler Yuta) Singles match for the AEW International Championship 12:05 6 \"Timeless\" Toni Storm (with Luther) defeated Hikaru Shida (c) Singles match for the AEW Women's World Championship 10:25 7 Ricky Starks and Big Bill (c) defeated La Facción Ingobernable (Rush and Dralístico) (with José the Assistant and Preston Vance), FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood), and Kings of the Black Throne (Malakai Black and Brody King) Four-way tag team ladder match for the AEW World Tag Team Championship 20:35 8 Julia Hart defeated Kris Statlander (c) and Skye Blue Three-way match for the AEW TBS Championship 11:20 9 Swerve Strickland (with Prince Nana) defeated \"Hangman\" Adam Page by knockout Texas Death match 29:55 10 The Golden Jets (Chris Jericho and Kenny Omega) defeated The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) Tag team match 20:45 11 MJF (c) (with Adam Cole) defeated Jay White (with Austin Gunn and Colten Gunn) Singles match for the AEW World Championship 29:45 ==References== Category:2023 in sports Category:2023 in the United States Category:AEW Full Gear Category:Sports in California Category:November 2023 events Category:Inglewood, California",
