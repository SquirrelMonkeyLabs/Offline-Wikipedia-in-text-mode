Today Takfir wal-Hijra has members or supporters in several other countries, allied to Al-Qaeda. In Spain the group is also known as Martyrs for Morocco. The group started as a offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1960s. Members of the group are Islamists. It looks like the members of the group are not bound by the usual Islamic religious constraints. They adopt non-Islamic appearances. They might shave their beard or wear a tie. They do this to be hard to detect in crowds. Sometimes, even other Muslims have problems detecting them. They can drink alcohol and even eat pork to deceive their enemies. They believe that any means justify the end and, that killing other Muslims can be justified in their cause and that Western society is heathen and it is their duty to destroy it.\"Al Qaeda's New Front\" Frontline PBS News, 25 January 2005 Little is known about the current organization or hierarchy of the group. Several groups which adhere to the same ideology have possibly used the name independently of each other. ==References== Category:1960s establishments Category:Islamic terrorism Category:Rebel militia groups in Africa Category:Islamic organizations based in Egypt",
