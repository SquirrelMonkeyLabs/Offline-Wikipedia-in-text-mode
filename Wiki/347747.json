The regions of Belarus are divided into raions (districts). The layout and size of the regions were created in 1960 when Belarus (then the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic) became a republic of the Soviet Union. == History == At the start of the 20th century, the borders of the Belarusian lands in the Russian Empire were still being made. In 1900 it was made of the entire Minsk Governorate and Mogilev Governorate, most of Grodno Governorate, parts of Vitebsk Governorate, and parts of Vilna Governorate (Vilna Governorate is now in Lithuania). World War I, the independence of Poland, and the 1920-1921 Polish–Soviet War changed the borders. In 1921, Belarus had what is now all of Minsk Region except for the western fringe, the western part of Gomel Region, a western slice of Mahilyow Region, and a small part of Vitebsk Region. In 1926, the eastern part of Gomel Region was added. In Soviet Belarus, new administrative units, called oblast or voblast were created in 1938. And again, during World War II, the borders changed. In 1939 they were reset with Belarus gaining territory to the west, Baranavichy, Belastok (Białystok), Brest, Pinsk, and Vileyka oblasts. In 1944 Belastok was removed and the new oblasts of Babruysk, Grodno, and Polotsk were created. At the same time, Vileyka Oblast was renamed Molodechno Oblast. At different times between 1938 and 1960, the following oblasts existed: * Babruysk Oblast, created 1944, deleted 1954 * Baranavichy Oblast, created 1939, deleted 1954 * Belastok Oblast, created 1939, deleted 1944 (now Białystok in Poland) * Brest Oblast, created 1939 * Gomel Oblast, created 1938 * Grodno Oblast, created 1944 * Maladzyechna Oblast renamed from Vileyka Oblast 1944, deleted 1960 * Mogilev Oblast, created 1938 * Minsk Oblast, created 1938 * Navahrudak Oblast, created 1939, renamed Baranavichy Oblast December 1939 * Pinsk Oblast, created 1939, deleted 1954 * Polatsk Oblast, created 1944, deleted 1954 * Polesia Oblast, created 1938, deleted 1954 * Vitebsk Oblast, created 1938 * Vileyka Oblast, created 1939, renamed to Maladzyechna Oblast 1944 == Regions == Regions of Belarus Flag Region Capital Russian Belarusian Population (2022)Official 2022 census results Area (km2) Density Percentage of Belarus 1 City of Minsk Минск Мінск 1,987,000 305.50 6,606.48 21.44% 2 Brest Brest Брестская Брэсцкая 1,356,000 32,790.68 41.11 14.32% 3 Gomel Gomel Гомельская Гомельская 1,380,000 40,361.66 34.40 14.75% 4 Grodno Grodno Гродненская Гродзенская 1,037,000 25,118.07 40.88 10.91% 5 Mogilev Mogilev Могилёвская Магілёўская 1,018,000 29,079.01 35.24 10.89% 6 Minsk Minsk Минская Мінская 1,464,000 39,912.35 36.86 15.63% 7 Vitebsk Vitebsk Витебская Вiцебская 1,128,000 40,049.99 28.36 12.06% Belarus Minsk Беларусь 9,370,000 207,617.26 45.34 100.00% == Historical division == == References == == Other websites == * Interactive map of Belarus * Regions (oblasts) of Belarus, The official President's website * Geography of Belarus, The official website of Belarus * Belarusian regions, towns and villages * Current Status of United Nations Romanization Systems for Geographical Names of Belarus Category:Regions of Belarus Category:Belarus- related lists",
