 "text": "The Government of India Act 1858 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (21 & 22 Vict. c. 106) passed on August 2, 1858. Its provisions called for the liquidation of the British East India Company (who had up to this point been ruling British India under the auspices of Parliament) and the transference of its functions to the British Crown.Wolpert, Stanley (1989). A New History of India (3d ed.), pp. 239â€“40. Oxford University Press. . The Act ushered in a new period of Indian history, bringing about the end of Company rule in India. The era of the new British Raj would last until Partition of British India in August 1947, at which time all of the territory of the British Raj was granted Dominion status within the Dominion of Pakistan and the Dominion of India. ==References== Category:1858 Category:1850s in the United Kingdom Category:19th century in India",
