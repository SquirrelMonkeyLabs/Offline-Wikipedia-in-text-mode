 "text": "Achatinella is a genus of small, colorful snails commonly known as the Oahu tree snails. Oahu tree snails are endemic to the island of Oahu, meaning they are found only in Oahu. == Decline == When the invasive rosy wolfsnail was introduced to Oahu by humans, it began eating native snail species. As a result Hawaiian snails began disappearing rapidly. Only about 10 of the original 40 Achatinella species are known to still exist, as the others are extinct. == Species == The following are some of the more notable species of Achatinella: *Achatinella apexfulvaâ€  *Achatinella bulimoides *Achatinella byronii **Achatinella byronii decipiens *Achatinella concavospira *Achatinella curta *Achatinella fulgens *Achatinella fuscobasis *Achatinella lila *Achatinella livida *Achatinella mustelina *Achatinella sowerbyana Category:Gastropods",
