 "text": "Rina Gonoi (born September 29, 1999) is a Japanese former soldier. After she left the army she started a public campaign in 2022, demanding truth and a formal apology after she was sexually assaulted by drunken male officers during training in 2021. Attempts were made to brush her allegations and she received anonymous threats. However in September 2022 the Japan Ground Self- Defense Force acknowledged that her allegations were accurate and the four male officers apologised to her in person. In December 2022 she was named by the Financial Times as one of the 25 most influential women of 2022. ==References== Category:Japanese military people Category:1999 births Category:Sexual abuse victims Category:BBC 100 Women",
