 "text": "Acre Port is an ancient port in the old city of Acre, Israel. The port has a 2000-year-old history. Recent archaeology suggests that the port was originally in the south of Acre, at the mouth of Na'aman River. The port was closed in the time of the British Mandate, which chose to use the Haifa Port instead of Acre. In 1965, a new breakwater was built. In 1982, the port became a marina. == Other websites == * Old City of Acre website (Hebrew) Category:Ports and harbours of Israel Category:Northern District (Israel)",
