Some use \"green and\" instead of \"little\", or change the last frog's reference to \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\". == Hand motions == There are hand motions people can follow during the song. * Line #1: By show of fingers, hold up the number of frogs sitting on the log. * Line #2: Draw in your hands close to your chest and curl your fingers downward, facing the floor as though you are a frog perched atop a log. * Line #3: Pretend to eat while you sing 'Eating some most delicious bugs', then rub your belly while singing 'yum, yum!'. * Line #4: Hold one finger up to show the frog who fell off the log. * Line #5: Pretend to fall over. * Line #6: By a show of fingers, hold up the number of frogs still on the log while singing \"Now there are four green speckled frogs\". Upon singing \"(glub, glub)\", do it again, except look up as though you were a frog underneath the water. == References == Category:Children's songs",
