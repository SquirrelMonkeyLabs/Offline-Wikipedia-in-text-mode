Note: Originally appeared in the Warrnambool Standard (Fairfax Media). Joel had played guitar since the age of 11 and Ryan got his first drum kit four years later also at the age of 11. Joel met David Roads (born c. 1983) when the two worked at the Hotel Warrnambool. The pair brought their guitars to work and, after their shifts, jammed on song ideas, Roads was asked to join the O'Keeffe brothers on rhythm guitar for rehearsals at their house. By late 2003, Adam Jacobson had joined on bass guitar, the group was named Airbourne and played regular gigs at the local Criterion Hotel. Note: Originally appeared in the Warrnambool Standard (Fairfax Media). In March 2004 the four-piece won a statewide band competition, Push-On, in Melbourne.

They recorded an eight-track extended play, Ready to Rock, which appeared in July 2004 as an independent self-funded release. By that time Jacobson was replaced by Justin Street (born c. 1986) on bass guitar – Ryan had met Street while stumbling home drunk from a party one night.

In a September 2008 interview with MetalSucks, Joel discussed comparisons with AC/DC, \"whoever you are when you come out, especially if you’re from Australia and you sound like we do, you’re going to get compared to anyone who is out there. It doesn’t matter who you are, you are going to get compared to somebody. To be compared to the best rock and roll band in the business, who are still going today and are about to release another album, there is no higher compliment...\" In November at the Astoria in London, Dan Hawkins (Stone Gods/The Darkness) joined Airbourne on stage to play the AC/DC song, \"Whole Lotta Rosie\". Hawkins played Joel's guitar (white Gibson Explorer) while Joel sang without any guitar. === No Guts. No Glory.
