 "text": "The Soanian culture () is a prehistoric technological culture from the Siwalik Hills in the South Asia. It is named after the Soan River Valley in Pakistan. Soanian sites are found all along the Siwalik region but the major sites are in the Soan region of Pakistan. The Soanian culture has been dated back to the Middle Pleistocene period (774,000 to 129,000 years ago) or the mid-Holocene epoch (Northgrippian). This culture was first discovered and named by the anthropology and archaeology team led by Helmut De Terra and Thomas Thomson Paterson. Soanian artifacts were made of quartzite pebbles, cobbles, and boulders, all from the Siwalik region. Apart from a few places, like the Soan Valley in Pakistan, there aren't many places where you find a lot of Soanian tools. Usually, you'll only find a few dozen of these artifacts in one spot. Soanian tools likely came about because of how rocks formed in the past. This made it easy for people to move around the materials they needed to make these tools. == References == Category:Ancient history of Pakistan Category:Ancient culture of Pakistan category:Archaeological sites in Pakistan",
