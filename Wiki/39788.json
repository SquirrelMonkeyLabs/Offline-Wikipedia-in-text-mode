 "text": "Vincenzo Bellini (Catania, November 3 1801 - Puteaux, near Paris, September 23 1835) was an Italian composer and opera composer. Bellini was well liked for his melodies. His first success was Il pirata in 1827. It was followed by I Capuleti e Montecchi in 1830. Then came his most famous operas La sonnambula (1831), Norma (1831) and his last I puritani (1835). His second to last work Beatrice di Tenda (1833) was less successful. Although his operas never left the repertoire, they became popular again in the 1950s due largely to soprano Maria Callas, followed by Joan Sutherland in the 1960s. ==Reference== * The Complete Dictionary of Opera and Operetta, James Anderson, Wings Books, 1993.
