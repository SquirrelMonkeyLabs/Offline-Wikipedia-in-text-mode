 "text": "The Bello rocket frog (Hyloxalus abditaurantius) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground and on plants near water. It lives high in the hills in the Andes mountains. People have also seen it in forest that is growing back. Scientists think it can live in places that humans have changed. People have seen this frog between 1280 and 2110 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Regional Ucumari, Parque Regional Barbas-Bremen, Parque Nacional Tatam√°, and Parque Nacional Farrallones de Cali. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives to make farms, get wood to build with, and make places for animals to eat grass. Years ago, many of these frogs died. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could have killed them, but they are not sure. Scientists found a frog that had the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in its body in 1997 and more after that. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
