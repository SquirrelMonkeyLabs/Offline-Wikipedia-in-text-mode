 "text": "Joseph Augustus Zarelli ( February 1957), previously known as \"The Boy in the Box\" while unidentified, was a American boy whose body was discovered in a cardboard box sometime in late February 1957 in a wooded area off the side of the Susquehanna Road in Fox Chase, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Zarelli appeared to have been cleaned and freshly groomed, with a recent haircut and trimmed fingernails, although however the boy suffered extensive child abuse before his death. He had multiple bruises, and was also severely malnourished, weighing just about 30 pounds when discovered. At the time of discovery, he was unidentified and therefore was called \"The Boy in the Box\". On 8 December 2022, the boy was positively identified as Joseph Augustus Zarelli, after remaining unidentified for 65 years, 9 months, and 13 days.
