His reign lasted from 1875 to 1908, but in practice he ruled, without Empress Dowager Cixi's influence, only from 1889 to 1898. He initiated the Hundred Days' Reform, but was abruptly stopped when the empress dowager launched a coup in 1898, after which he became powerless and was held under house arrest until his death. His era name, \"Guangxu\", means \"glorious succession\". He was involved in the First Sino-Japanese War from 1894-1895,and the Boxer Rebellion from 1899-1901 .
