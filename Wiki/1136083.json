This frog lives in rainforests that human beings have changed and in thorn forests where it is very dry. People saw this frog near streams. During the day, this frog hides under big rocks. This frog is awake at night. ==Young== Scientists saw tadpoles swimming in streams. During part of its life, the tadpole is 12.5 mm long without the tail and 30.0 mm long with the tail. The body is round and wider than it is tall. The nose is round. Its eyes are on the top of its head and look out to the top and sides.
