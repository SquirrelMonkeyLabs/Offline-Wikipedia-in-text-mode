 "text": "Brenda Ann Spencer (born in San Diego, California on April 3 1962) is a convicted American murderer who performed a deadly shooting spree, during which she killed two people at the Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego on January 29, 1979. The two people whom she killed were Burton Wragg, the school principal, and Mike Suchar, the school custodian. Another nine people got hurt during that incident - eight children and one police officer. Spencer showed no remorse in her crime; her full explanation of her actions was \"I donâ€™t like Mondays; this livens up the day.\" Those comments were the inspiration to the song I Don't Like Mondays by The Boomtown Rats, which reached #1 in the United Kingdom in mid 1979. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:American murderers Category:American prisoners Category:Criminals from California Category:People from San Diego",
