 "text": "The 2025 Nepal Teachers' Protest was a big strike and protest by school teachers across Nepal in April 2025. It was organized by the Nepal Teachers' Federation (NTF). The teachers were against a new School Education Bill from the government. They said the bill would reduce job safety, give too much control to the central government, and break earlier promises made to teachers' groups. == Background == After Nepal became a federal country in 2015, teacher hiring and management changed to local governments. Teachers' groups said this caused unfair rules and political problems. A new education law was proposed in 2023, but it was not passed for over a year and did not follow earlier agreements. == Protests and Demands == On April 2, 2025, teachers from all 77 districts started an indefinite strike. Many gathered in Kathmandu, especially near Maitighar and New Baneshwor. Schools were closed and normal life was disturbed. The teachers wanted job safety, equal pay with civil servants, social security, and no handover of teacher management to local governments. == Main Events == \\- April 2: The protest started with a peaceful rally in Kathmandu. NTF asked the government to move the education bill to Parliament quickly. \\- April 14: Big rallies caused problems in traffic in Kathmandu. Maitighar Mandala and New Baneshwor were major protest sites. \\- April 21: Education Minister Bidya Bhattarai resigned because of the pressure from protests. \\- April 22: The National Examination Board delayed the Grade 12 exams that were to begin on April 24. \\- April 27: 27 teachers, one journalist, and police officers were hurt in a clash at Singha Durbar in Kathmandu. \\- April 30: The protest ended after a nine-point agreement was signed between the government and the NTF. It included job safety and a promise to pass the bill. == Government Reaction == The government invited teachers for talks, but early discussions did not succeed. Some human rights groups said the police used too much force. Talks on April 27 also failed to make an agreement. == Agreement == On April 30, after 29 days of protest, the strike ended with a nine-point agreement. It included job safety, respect for earlier promises, and faster law approval. == Related pages == * Constitution of Nepal == References == Category:Nepal",
