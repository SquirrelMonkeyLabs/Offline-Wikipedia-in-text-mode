 "text": "An international student is an individual who travels to a country other than their own for the purpose of undertaking educational studies. These students typically enroll in institutions of higher education such as universities or colleges but may also attend secondary schools or participate in exchange programs. International students often require a student visa or permit to reside and study in their host country. Their legal status and rights vary depending on the country and its immigration policies. Some countries allow international students to work part-time during their studies, while others place restrictions on employment. Motivations for studying abroad include access to higher-quality education, cultural exchange, language acquisition, and improved career prospects. Hosting international students can benefit countries economically, socially, and academically by promoting diversity and global perspectives on campuses. Challenges faced by international students may include cultural adjustment, language barriers, financial burdens, and adapting to different academic standards or systems. Many governments, universities, and international organizations provide scholarships, support services, and resources to assist international students with their academic and personal integration.",
