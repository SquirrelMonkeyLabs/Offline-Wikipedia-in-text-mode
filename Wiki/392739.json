 "text": "Old Town (Gamlebyen, in Norwegian) is a part of the city of Oslo, Norway. It is the original town settlement of Oslo. The bishop's estate or Oslo bispegård was a building as far back as 1197. Its cellar still remains. There was a great fire in the town in 1624. After the fire, a new city was started on the other side of Bjørvika. After those things happened, Old Town lost its city privileges. After that, Old Town remained a suburb of the city, Christiania. In 1725, Oslo Ladegård was built on top of the cellar of Bishop's estate. Oslo did not become the largest city in Norway, until the 19th century. The Norwegian Royal Family previously lived here. There were also several churches and the home for the Bishop of Oslo here. Today, there are still ruins left of the old town, protected in parks. Category:Oslo",
