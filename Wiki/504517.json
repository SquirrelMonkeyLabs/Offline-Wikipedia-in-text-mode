 "text": "The Presidential $1 Coin Program is part of an Act of Congress, , which directs the United States Mint to produce $1 coins with portraits of U.S. presidents. From 2007 to 2011, presidential $1 coins were minted for circulation in large numbers, resulting in a large stockpile of unused $1 coins. Since 2012, new presidential coins have been minted only for collectors. ==Coin details== Dollar coins were issued bearing the likenesses of presidents, as follows: Release number President number President name Release date Denver Mintage Philadelphia Mintage Total Mintage Design In office 1 1st George Washington February 15, 2007 163,680,000 176,680,000 340,360,000 1789–1797 2 2nd John Adams May 17, 2007 112,140,000 112,420,000 224,560,000 1797–1801 3 3rd Thomas Jefferson August 16, 2007 102,810,000 100,800,000 203,610,000 1801–1809 4 4th James Madison November 15, 2007 87,780,000 84,560,000 172,340,000 1809–1817 5 5th James Monroe February 14, 2008 60,230,000 64,260,000 124,490,000 1817–1825 6 6th John Quincy Adams May 15, 2008 57,720,000 57,540,000 115,260,000 1825–1829 7 7th Andrew Jackson August 14, 2008 61,070,000 61,180,000 122,250,000 1829–1837 8 8th Martin Van Buren November 13, 2008 50,960,000 51,520,000 102,480,000 1837–1841 9 9th William Henry Harrison February 19, 2009 55,160,000 43,260,000 98,420,000 1841 10 10th John Tyler May 21, 2009 43,540,000 43,540,000 87,080,000 1841–1845 11 11th James K.
