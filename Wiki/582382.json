 "text": "Mad Libs is a fill-in-the-blank word game invented during the 1950's by Roger Price and Leonard B. Stern. One player chooses a story and then replaces words with blanks containing (noun, verb, adjective, colour, food, part of body, celebrity, etc.). The other player fills in the blanks by saying examples of the words' types, but without showing where they are in the story. A usually nonsensical story will be made. Category:Word games",
