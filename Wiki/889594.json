 "text": "Early in the 15th century St. Colette of Corbie (1381â€“1447), in France, sought to reform the order. She restored the primitive observance in 17 monasteries during her lifetime and reasserted the strict principle of poverty; her followers came to be called the Colettine Poor Clares, or Poor Clares of St. Colette (P.C.C.), and today are located mostly in France. The Capuchin Sisters, originating in Naples in 1538, and the Alcantarines, of 1631, are also Poor Clares of the strict observance. Category:1380s births Category:1440s deaths",
