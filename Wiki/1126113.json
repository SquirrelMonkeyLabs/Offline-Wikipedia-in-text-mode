 "text": "I Am the Night is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera. It was released on August 16, 1985 through Metal Magic Records. It was made available only on vinyl and cassette. The album sold around 25,000 copies. This was considered high for an independent release. It was the last Pantera album to feature lead singer Terry Glaze. He left the band in 1986 due to musical differences. It was also the band's last album with a primarily glam metal sound. The song \"Hot 'N' Heavy\" would be made into the band's second music video. It would also be released as the band's first ever single. The album takes influence from Ratt, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. ==Reception== AllMusic writer Eduardo Rivadavia gave I Am the Night a score of 3.5 stars out of a possible 5. His main criticism of the album were Terry Glaze's vocals. The best part about the album in his opinion was \"Diamond\" Darrell's playing. He stated that his \"often jaw-dropping riffs and solos, holding the songs together with iron-fisted precision.\" ==Track listing== All credits are from the original LP. ==Personnel== All credits are from the original LP. ;Pantera *Terrence Lee – vocals *Diamond Darrell – guitars *Rex Rocker – bass, backing vocals *Vinnie Paul – drums ;Production *Jerry Abbott – production, engineering, mixing *Tom Coyne – mastering *Recorded and mixed at Pantego Sound, Pantego, Texas ==References== Category:Pantera albums Category:1985 albums",
