She was elected as a Labour councillor. She is the the first Arab Muslim woman councillor in the city. She resigned from the party in October 2023 as a protest against what she said were \"horrifying comments\" by Keir Starmer about the 2023 Israelâ€“Hamas war. She said he showed a \"lack of humanity\" to Palestinians. In 2021 she organised a petition to ban racists from football games. It got three quarters of a million signatures in 24 hours. After UEFA Euro 2020 racist social media posts were made at footballers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka. She set up The Three Hijabis as an anti-racist platform with two other British Muslim women football fans who wear the hijab, Shaista Aziz and Huda Jawad. In 2016 she was given an award by the Remembering Srebrenica organisation. ==References== Category:Politicians from Manchester Category:Labour Party (UK) people",
