It now takes place in more than 193 countries around the world. During Earth Day, the world encourages everyone to turn off all unwanted lights. On Earth day we should give something to our mother land like we can plant trees. ==History== It was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22, 1970.
