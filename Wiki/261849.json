 "text": "Social Security or social welfare is the name given to government programs to provide money for people who need it. Social security systems may be linked to health care. War pensions are the most ancient type of social security. They are mentioned by Plutarch. Universal benefits are those where everyone who meets the conditions - such as children under a certain age or people who are ill or disabled - are paid. Contributory and means tested benefits have conditions which people have to meet. == Contributions == In many countries Social Security provides support only to people who have paid contributions. Most pension systems are for people who have paid contributions. Contributions are regular payments taken from their pay when they are working. They will be recorded by the government. The right to a pension may include dependent members of the family. Pensions may then be paid to their widows and orphans. People may also make regular payments into private pensions. == Means test == Means tested benefits are paid to people who can show that they are poor. There are usually tests both of regular income and of capital. They are usually paid to households. Before government schemes were started in many places charities would help people who were thought to need it. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights law make the \"right to an adequate standard of living\" one of the human rights. ==Africa== Although social security coverage in Africa is low by global standards,Social Security in Africa - Overview a number of social welfare programs have existed throughout the history of the continent.
