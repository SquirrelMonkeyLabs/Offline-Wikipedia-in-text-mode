 "text": "A simple sentence (sometimes called an independent clause) is a sentence that contains one subject and one verb.Brian Backman, Building Sentence Skills (Westminster, CA: Teacher Created Materials, 2003), p. 7 It has only one clause. It must also express a complete thought.Fred Obrecht, Minimum Essentials of English (Hauppauge, NY: Barron's Educational Series, 1999), p. 31 This follows the rules of syntax in English grammar. == Length == A simple sentence is not defined by how short it is.Gary Lutz; Diane Stevenson, The Writer's Digest Grammar Desk Reference (Cincinnati: Writer's Digest Books, 2005), p. 77 A simple sentences is often short and uncomplicated. But it is not limited by the number of words used to express the thought. For example: * \"Bill reads\". This is a simple sentence. \"Bill\" is the subject and \"reads\" is the action (verb). * \"Being an English teacher with a penchant for syntactical complexity, I love to read simple sentences upon getting up and before going to bed.\" This is still a simple sentence even though it uses more words. == Simple or dependent? == A simple sentence or independent clause is one that has a meaning to a reader or listener. If the sentence does not complete the thought, it may be a dependent clause. A dependent clause is one that does not express a complete thought. By itself it is a sentence fragment. It may look like a simple sentence, but it will not make sense on its own. * \"Bill reads\". Again, a simple sentence. Bill (a noun for a subject) reads (the action that completes the thought). * \"Because Bill wants to learn more.\" What happens because Bill wants to learn more? We do not know, so that is not a sentence. It is a dependent clause. == Related pages == * Sentence * English grammar * Compound sentence * Complex sentence == References == == Other websites == * Sentences: Simple, Compound, and Complex Category:English language Category:Sentences",
