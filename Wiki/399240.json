It includes the suburbs of Kew, Hawthorn, Hawthorn East, Balwyn, Canterbury, Camberwell and Surrey Hills. It is named after the suburb of Kooyong. Kooyong is an Indigenous Australian word meaning resting place. Because of boundary changes over the years, the suburb of Kooyong is no longer in the Division and is now in the Division of Higgins. ==Members== Member Party Term William Knox Free Trade, Anti-Socialist 1901–1909 Commonwealth Liberal 1909–1910 Sir Robert Best Commonwealth Liberal 1910–1917 Nationalist 1917–1922 John Latham Liberal Union 1922–1925 Nationalist 1925–1931 United Australia 1931–1934 Sir Robert Menzies United Australia 1934–1944 Liberal 1944–1966 Andrew Peacock Liberal 1966–1994 Petro Georgiou Liberal 1994–2010 Josh Frydenberg Liberal 2010–2022 Monique Ryan Independent 2022- Kooyong has been held by non-Labor parties since 1901.
