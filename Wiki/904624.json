 "text": "The Santa Barbara tree frog or Alvarenga's tree frog (Bokermannohyla alvarengai) is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives in the Serra do Espinha√ßo mountains. With most frogs, the adult female is larger than the adult male. But with these frogs, the male frog is larger than the female frog. The male frogs also have larger, stronger front legs and larger spines. Scientists say that when male frogs are larger than female frogs, it is because the male frogs fight each other. Male Santa Barbara tree frogs sometimes have scars on their skin that could be from fighting each other. But few teams of scientists have watched and written science papers about Santa Barbara tree frogs. They do not know for sure if this is why the male frogs are larger. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
