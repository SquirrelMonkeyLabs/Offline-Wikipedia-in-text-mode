 "text": "Physicalism is the view that everything in the universe is made out of physical matter. Physicalism does not believe in gods, spirits, or other things that are not made of physical material. A person who believes in physicalism is a physicalist. Materialism and physicalism are very similar concepts, because physicalism was a response to materialism. Physicalism is against idealism, which states that everything comes from mental processes. ==References== Category:Epistemology Category:Philosophical movements and positions",
