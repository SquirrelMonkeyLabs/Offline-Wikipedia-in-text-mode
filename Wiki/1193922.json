 "text": "The Bernheim petition was a 1933 petition by Franz Bernheim, a Jewish resident of Gleiwitz, German Upper Silesia, to the League of Nations to protest the Nazi anti-Jewish laws. * Brugel, J. W. \"The Bernheim petition: A challenge to Nazi Germany in 1933.\" Patterns of Prejudice 17.3 (1983): 17-25. * Bernheim Petition, Yad Vashem * Erpelding, Michel. Upper Silesian Mixed Commission. Max Planck Institute Luxembourg, 2017. Bernheim had been dismissed from his job as a manager at Gleiwitz Deutsches Familien-Kaufhaus in April 1933 due to Nazi anti-Jewish laws. ==Basis== The petition was made based on the 1922 Germanâ€“Polish Accord on East Silesia, consisting of provisions for the protection of minority rights and the set-up of a mixed German-Polish Commission for Upper Silesia. ==Content== The petition dealt with not only Bernheim's dismissal but also racism in Upper Silesia as a whole, quoting the provisions for firing \"non-Aryan\" public employees, notaries, lawyers, teachers, and medical professionals. ==Aftermath== The petition was accepted by the League, and led not only to compensations for Bernheim, but also to the cancellation of most racial provisions of the laws in Upper Silesia. However, when article 147 of the accord on East Silesia expired on July 15, 1937, racial provisions in German laws were applied in Upper Silesia as well. ==References== Category:1930s Category:The Holocaust Category:History of Poland Category:History of Germany Category:Antisemitism in Europe",
