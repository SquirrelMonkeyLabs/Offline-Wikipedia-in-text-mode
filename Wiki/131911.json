 "text": "This is a list of residences occupied by the British Royal family, noting the seasons of the year they are traditionally occupied. Members of the British Royal Family live in many different residences around the United Kingdom. Some are royal palaces, owned by the state and held in trust by the monarch; others are privately owned. Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House have been inherited as private property for several generations. Other royal palaces are no longer residences (e.g. the Palace of Westminster, the Palace of Whitehall). Some remain in irregular use for royal occasions. The Royal Palaces enjoy certain legal privileges, for example there is an exemption from levying duty on alcoholic beverages sold in the bars at the Palace of Westminster and there are exemptions from Health and Safety legislation. The occupied royal residences of are cared for and maintained by the Royal Household Property Section. The unoccupied royal palaces of England are now within the responsibility of the Historic Royal Palaces Agency. ==Current royal residences by members of the Royal Family == Residence Location Notes His Majesty King Charles And Her Majesty Queen Camilla ===Official=== St. James's Palace London Technically still the \"senior palace\" of the monarch; the Chapel Royal is situated there and foreign ambassadors are still accredited to it.
