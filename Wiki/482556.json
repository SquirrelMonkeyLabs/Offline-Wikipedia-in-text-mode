He was one of the longest ruling monarchs in European history. His family has ruled Monaco for seven centuries. Prince Rainier was internationally known due to his marriage to the American actress Grace Kelly. He was responsible for reforms to the Constitution of Monaco. He expanded the principality's economy beyond its traditional casino gambling base. Gambling accounts for about three percent of the nation's annual revenue today. When Rainier became prince in 1949, it had accounted for more than ninety-five percent. == References == Category:1923 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Deaths from renal failure Category:Military personnel of World War II Category:Princes and princesses of Monaco",
