 "text": "The Russian Spaniel is a medium sized gundog of the spaniel type which was developed in the Soviet Union after World War II. ==History== There were some English Springer Spaniels and English Cocker Spaniels imported into Russia in the early 20th century, these were cross bred with other Russian hunting dogs and this breed was made official there in 1951. ==Colours== Any lot of mixes of colours is allowed in this breed, but they are mostly brown and white, black and white, red and white or tri-coloured. They look a lot like their English Springer Spaniel cousins. ==Temperment== Russian Spaniels are usually very gentle with people and other dogs. Like all spaniels they need a lot of exercise. As they are bred to be hunting dogs, care should be taken when they are around other small animals like rabbits and birds. ==Gallery== File:The Soviet Union 1988 CPA 5948 stamp (Russian Spaniel.
