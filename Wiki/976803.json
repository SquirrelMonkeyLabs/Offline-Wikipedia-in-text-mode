Oh Motherland We rise raising flag with the guiding star And singing songs of freedom with joy; For justice, liberty and prosperity Shall forever more reign! Oh great patriots Let us stand up in silence and respect, Saluting our martyrs whose blood Cemented our national foundation, We vow to protect our nation.
