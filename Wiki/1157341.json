 "text": "== What is a Blanet == A Blanet (short for Black hole Planet) is a planet that orbits a black hole. Blanets are hypothetical planets that would orbit a black hole, they will not be sucked into the black hole but they will be close enough to get affected by its gravity. == How they might be formed == If they are real, they might form a similar way a normal planet does, forming in the dense clouds of gas and dust around the black hole, the dust particles collide and stick together, making bigger clumps, over time, these clumps will grow and develop gravity which will bring in more clumps of gas eventually forming a Blanet. They will either become rocky planet, smaller then Earth or larger then Earth, or they will be Neptune sized. These Blanets will highly likely not support life unless they are in orbit with a star and that star orbits the black hole. == Current research == Researchers are studying the possibility of Blanets, while no confirmed Blanets have been found.
