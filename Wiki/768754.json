 "text": "Appeal to novelty is a fallacy where a person would claim that Subject B is better than Subject A because Subject B is newer, or that \"newer is better\". This fallacy is understandable because people find new discoveries everyday. Since new discoveries are made everyday, people are quick to think that the new thing will be better than the old thing because of the possibility that the new thing was made to fix the mistakes of the old thing. An example of appeal to novelty is that \"the newer versions of the iPhone will always be better then the older versions because smartphone technology becomes more advanced every year.\" An example that people use to prove this argument wrong is New Coke, because even though it was made later than the older Coca-Cola, most people who have tasted New Coke say it tasted worse than Coca-Cola. The opposite of appeal to novelty is appeal to tradition. == References == Category:Logical fallacies",
