 "text": "On 14 May 1607, just over one hundred men settled in what is now Jamestown, Virginia to become the first permanent English colony in the New World. In 1619 the first women and slaves arrived, and the colonists elected some of their number to the House of Burgesses, the first representative legislature in the Americas. The colony was chartered on 10 April 1606, one year back. To mark the 350th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown Settlement, in 1957 a large festival park opened with much ballyhoo: Queen Elizabeth II of England made an official appearance and loaned a copy of Magna Carta for the exhibition. There is now a working reconstruction of the settlement -- and of the three ships that brought the colonists: the Godspeed, the Discovery, and the Susan Constant (or Sarah Constant) -- that is very popular with tourists, especially school groups. Recent archeological work at the site is still expanding our knowledge of what happened at Jamestown in its earliest days. Category:History of Virginia Category:1607",
