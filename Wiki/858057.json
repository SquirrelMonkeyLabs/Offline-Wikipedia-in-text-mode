Theology of Muntzer combines spiritual elements, apocalyptic elements, and social elements. He believed that the Roman Catholic Church, with which he had quarrels, was similar to the Whore of Babylon from the Book of Revelation. == References == Category:German theologians Category:1489 births Category:1525 deaths",
