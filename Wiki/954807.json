 "text": "Hazardous waste is any waste that contains chemicals, toxic or corrosive materials. Hazardous waste can be found in many industries, including mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. It can also be produced by households through activities such as cleaning up after a spill or accident. These materials can pollute the environment and pose threat to human lives. The main reason for this is that these hazardous wastes are not properly disposed of. They can cause serious environmental damage such as groundwater pollution, air pollution and soil contamination. == Definition == Hazardous waste is any waste that contains chemicals, toxic or corrosive materials. Hazardous waste can be found in many industries, including mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. It can also be produced by households through activities such as cleaning up after a spill or accident. Hazardous waste is any waste that has been determined to be hazardous under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. Hazardous wastes are divided into two general categories: ignitable waste and corrosive waste. === Hazardous wastes are materials that === # Are liquid, solid, or gas at room temperature and pressure; # Have a characteristic odor; # Can cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm if swallowed; # Have an acute or chronic toxic effect on humans; # Are combustible; and/or # Combustible liquids present a fire or explosive hazard. Hazardous waste is called \"hazardous\" because of the potential harm it could cause to people or the environment. For example, if you spilled a paint thinner on your carpet, it could cause burns to anyone who breathes in the fumes. When hazardous wastes are improperly handled, they can release harmful chemicals into the air or water supply that cause health problems for nearby residents and wildlife. These wastes also pose risk to workers who handle them improperly or who work with them on a regular basis. If proper precautions are not taken when handling hazardous waste, accidents can occur which may result in death or serious injury to workers and others who come into contact with them. == Authorization == The rule 6 of the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 and amendment thereto shall be required to make an application in Form 1 to the State Pollution Control Board and obtain an authorisation from the State Pollution Control Board of Every occupier of the facility who is engaged in handling, generation, collection, storage, packaging, transportation, use, treatment, processing, recycling, recovery, pre-processing, co-processing, utilisation, offering for sale, transfer or disposal of the hazardous and other wastes. Such application for authorisation shall be accompanied with a copy each of the following documents, namely:- # Consent to establish granted by the State Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (25 of 1974) and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 (21 of 1981); # Consent to operate granted by the State Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (25 of 1974) and/or Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, (21 of 1981); # In case of renewal of authorisation, a self-certified compliance report in respect of effluent, emission standards and the conditions specified in the authorisation for hazardous and other wastes. == Procedures to get authorization under Hazardous Waste Management == The procedure for obtaining authorization under Hazardous Waste Management is as follows: # The owner of an industrial plant/facility must obtain an authorization from the local health office which is responsible for issuing such permits. The same applies to business establishments. # The health office will then issue a license to dispose of hazardous waste on your property, based on your companyâ€™s report and demonstration of compliance with all requirements (e.g., environmental impact assessment). # You must submit an annual report on the amount of hazardous waste disposed, its type, location and disposal method; along with other important information such as how much was recovered and recycled or resold during that year. You also need to keep detailed records showing your efforts at recycling or reusing hazardous waste materials in other ways (e.g., by selling them for reuse as raw materials). == References == Category:Air pollution Category:Water pollution",
