 "text": "The Dragon Fountain is a fountain at the Palace of Versailles in France. at the Palace of Versailles was dedicated by Gaspard Marsy in 1667. The fountain lies at the end of the northern axis between the Water Walk and Neptune Fountain. The Dragon Fountain shoots a jet of water 90 feet into the air. The Dragon Fountain was only operated when it was known the King would be present. All of the other fountains were required to be turned off for this spectacle to be accomplished. At other times it was regulated to a 35-foot jet. Statues of children mounted upon swans bedevil the Dragon. ==Gallery== File:Versailles-Les Grands Eaux Musicales-Bassin du Dragon.jpg|Jet File:Versailles-Les Eaux Musicales-Bassin du dragon-1.jpg|Dragon Fountain File:1920s Leconte Map of Paris w-Monuments and Map of Versailles - Geographicus - ParisVersailles-leconte-1920s - 2.jpg|Map of Versailles File:Versailles-Les Eaux Musicales-Bassin du dragon-2.jpg|Dragon Fountain Category:Fountains of Versailles",
