It was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming the first hip hop song to earn gold certification. In an interview, Blow was asked how he came up with the song. Blow said \"The concept was created as a tribute to all the breakers in and around the South Bronx and Harlem back in the early days of hip-hop. I wanted to do a tribute song with many breaks so that the breakers could get down and do their thing. When we danced during the breaks of a song, that was our time to go off - to do our best moves\". ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1980 songs Category:Hip hop songs",
