 "text": "L'Étoile du Nord is a French phrase meaning \"The Star of the North\". It is the motto of the U.S. state of Minnesota. It was chosen by the state's first governor, Henry Hastings Sibley, and was adopted in 1861, three years after Minnesota became a state. Because of this motto, one of Minnesota's nicknames is The North Star State. The Minnesota North Stars chose the English translation for their name. In the northern hemisphere, the North Star (Polaris) is a part of the tip of the handle and the brightest star of the constellation Ursa Minor (known also as Little Bear and as the Little Dipper). Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, because of Polaris being the star that is closest to the North Celestial Pole. ==References== Category:Minnesota Category:State mottos of the United States Category:French words and phrases",
