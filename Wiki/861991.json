 "text": "\"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\" is the 15th episode of The Simpsons 29th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on April 8, 2018. The episode is about Marge taking the Simpson family to a library. She learns that a book she loved to read as a child is racist. Bart gets the book The Art of War. He uses the book to get Homer to take him to a convention for video games. The episode was written by Jeff Westbrook and Mark Kirkland is the director of the episode. About 2.15 million people watched the episode when it was first broadcast. The episode makes an allusion to the documentary The Problem with Apu. The documentary talks about how the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon is a stereotype to Indian Americans. In the episode, Marge makes changes to the book she used to like (The Princess in the Garden) and reads it to Lisa. The new changes make the book shorter and not as emotional. Lisa looks at a picture of Apu and says that something that was liked in the past \"is now politically incorrect\". Hari Kondabolu (the writer of The Problem with Apu) wrote on Twitter that the episode did not get the meaning of the documentary. Many fans of The Simpsons thought that the show was not looking at the controversy of Apu seriously. Al Jean (showrunner of The Simpsons) later said he would try to find a better way for the show to talk about the controversy. == References == == Other websites == * Category:The Simpsons episodes Category:2018 television episodes",
