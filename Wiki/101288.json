 "text": "Tarantulas are a group of \"hairy\" and often very large spiders belonging to the family Theraphosidae. Approximately 900 species have been found. Some tarantulas hunt prey in trees and some hunt on the ground. All tarantulas can make silk. They use silk to make shelters like tube tents in trees, to line burrows if they live on the ground, and they all use silk to wrap up prey before they eat it. It is easy to see a tarantula turning around and around in one spot with the prey in its mouth, but it is hard to see the silk coming out because it is small in diameter (thickness) and transparent. These spiders are found in warmer regions around the world. Tarantulas' predators are normally big snakes or creatures such as the Tarantula Eating Wasp. Defenses are camouflage and fangs. == References == * * == Other websites == ;International Societies * American Tarantula Society Headquarters * The British Tarantula Society * German Arachnologic Society * The Australian Tarantula Association ;American Societies * SFBATS - San Francisco Bay Area Tarantula Society * N-TEC · Nebraska Tarantula Enthusiasts Club * MTTG · Middle Tennessee Tarantula Group ;Other sites * Tarantulas.us - Forums - Tarantula Discussion Boards and Caresheets. * Arachnoboards - Arachnid discussion board * Tarantula care - Gallery of tarantulas and other arachnids. * Tarantulas.us - Gallery - Photo gallery of tarantula's species. * How to Pick a tarantula and Care for a tarantula * Birdspiders.com - Rick C.
