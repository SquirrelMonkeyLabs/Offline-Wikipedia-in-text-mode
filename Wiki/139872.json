 "text": "Paresthesia (pron. ; paraesthesia in British English, pron. ) is a feeling of tingling, prickling, or numbness with no permanent effects. It is commonly called \"pins and needles\". This feeling may last a short while, or may be more long-lasting. A long-term effect means there is something wrong with neurons in the body. An example of this can be felt when sitting cross-legged for a long time and your foot \"falls asleep\". The tingling feeling you get when you move is paresthesia. ==Causes== Paresthesia has many known causes, including the following: *Alcoholism *Anticonvulsant drugs such as topiramate, sultiame, and acetazolamide *Anxiety and/or Panic Disorder *Decompression sickness *Dehydration *Fabry disease *Fibromyalgia *Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) *Heavy metals *Hyperventilation *Hyperkalemia *Hypothyroidism *Immune deficiency, such as Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) *Ingestion of Beta-alanine *Lidocaine poisoning *Lomotil *Low blood-sugar (Hypoglycaemia) *Menopause *Migraines *Multiple sclerosis *Nitrous Oxide, long term exposure *Obdormition *Radiation poisoning *Vitamin B5 deficiency *Vitamin B12 deficiency *Withdrawal from certain SSRIs, such as paroxetine ==References== ==Other websites== * Paresthesia in detail * What makes your arms, legs and feet fall asleep?
