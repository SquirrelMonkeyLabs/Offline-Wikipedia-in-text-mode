He beats levels of the game with challenges like not using certain buttons or the joystick. He is best known for the \"A-button challenge\" (ABC), which aims to beat the game without using the A button. The A-button is used for jumping, so this is very difficult to do. In 2015, he offered US$1,000 for anyone who could recreate a certain glitch in Super Mario 64, which has not been claimed yet as of 2024. == Super Mario 64 videos == Super Mario 64 was the first video game pannenkoek2012 played as a child.
