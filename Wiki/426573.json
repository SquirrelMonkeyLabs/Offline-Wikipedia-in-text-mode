 "text": "Jukeboxes are musical devices that play any selected song that is stored on it. They are partially automatic and usually operated by coin. The term jukebox came into use close to 1940, though in fact similar music devices were in use before that. The machines, however, have declined and been replaced by digital audio players and Internet music. Category:Music technology",
