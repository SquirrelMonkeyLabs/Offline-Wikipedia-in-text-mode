Pancake is the beloved puppet star of the local Malibu kids' series called \"The Pancake Buffalo Show.\" When Hannah Montana receives a diamond on a Hollywood street modeled after the Hollywood Walk of Fame, she requests the location be moved due to overly-frequent business in the area and learns that the area her diamond was originally intended to be placed was given to Pancake Buffalo. When Miley attempts to ask the kindly puppeteer of Pancake named Cindy Merriwether (played by Edie McClurg) to switch diamonds, she only communicates (rudely) through Pancake and refuses. Hannah then schemes to switch Pancake's dismal Street Diamond location with Hannah Montana's by playing on the childhood nostalgic fondness of her show by Hollywood Parade of Street Diamonds Committee Chairman Randall Harrison (played by Michael Boatman). She is successful, but ultimately a porta-john is placed directly over the newly moved Diamond much to Miley's astonished joy. Pancake is later seen \"occupying\" the stall and shooing away anyone who wishes to make use of it. * The puppets for Waffle the Cow-Monkey, DJ 1, DJ 2, DJ 3, and Pancake the Water Buffalo made appearances in Puppet Up! * Bozark the Elephant appeared in the movie Old Dogs. He alongside Scales the Dragon from the pilot to \"Little Mermaid's Island\" and Beak and YesNo from the proposed show \"Muppetmobile\" were seen as part of Jimmy Lunchbox's show. * The puppet for Waffle the Cow- Monkey appeared in No, You Shut Up! and The Happytime Murders. ==External links== * Animal Jam at Internet Movie Database Category:2003 American television series debuts Category:2003 American television series endings Category:2000s American children's television series Category:2000s preschool education television series Category:American preschool education television series Category:American television shows featuring puppetry Category:Television series about mammals Category:Television series by The Jim Henson Company Category:Discovery Kids original programming Category:TLC (TV network) original programming",
