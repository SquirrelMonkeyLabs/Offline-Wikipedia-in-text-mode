 "text": "The leopard rocket frog (Anomaloglossus leopardus) is a frog. Scientists found it in Suriname. They think it might also live in Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives in rainforests that have never been cut down, near streams. Scientists saw it about 480 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in Sipaliwini Nature Reserve. ==Young== Scientists think these frogs have young in the same way as other frogs in Anomaloglossus: The female lays eggs on leaves, and the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in big danger of dying out. People have not changed its home too much. However, scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could kill these frogs because it has killed other frogs in this part of South America. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
