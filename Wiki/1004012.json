He will formally launch his campaign in late April in his hometown of Bentonville. When he was Arkansas governor, he said that Republicans who tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election and spread Trump's \"Big Lie\" about the election should not be elected to office. Hutchinson announced the suspension of his campaign on January 16, 2024, the day after the Iowa Republican caucus. ==References== Hutchinson, Asa",
