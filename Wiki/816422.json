 "text": "Proteopedia is a wiki, 3D encyclopedia of proteins and other molecules. The site contains a page for every entry in the Protein Data Bank (>130,000 pages). Its pages are descriptive of protein structures in general such as acetylcholinesterase, hemoglobin, and the photosystem II. It employs a scene- authoring tool: users do not have to learn JSmol script language to create customized molecular scenes. Custom scenes are easily attached to \"green links\" in descriptive text that display those scenes in JSmol. A web browser is all that is needed to access the site and the 3D information; no viewers need be installed. == References == Category:Wikis Category:Enzymes Category:MediaWiki websites",
