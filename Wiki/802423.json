 "text": "The Croatian War of Independence was fought from 1991 to 1995 between Croat forces loyal to the government of Croatia—which had declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)—and the Serb-controlled Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and local Serb forces. In Croatia, the war is known as the \"Homeland War\" () and also as the \"Greater-Serbian Aggression\". In Serbian sources, \"War in Croatia\" and (rarely) \"War in Krajina\" are used. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1991 in Europe Category:1995 in Europe Category:1990s in Croatia Category:Wars of independence Category:1990s conflicts",
