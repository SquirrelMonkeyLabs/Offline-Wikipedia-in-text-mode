 "text": "A tailstrike is when the tail of an airplane hits the runway. This can happen during takeoff or landing. During takeoff, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too early and the plane cannot take off in time. During a landing, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too high during landing. Tailstrikes usually do not have serious effects, such as killing people. However, this means that the airline has to spend money to repair the plane before it can fly again. If the plane is not repaired correctly, it may cause metal fatigue and in the end, the plane can crash. == Examples of tailstrikes == *Emirates Flight 407 *Pan Am Flight 845 *Asiana Airlines Flight 214 == Crashes caused by incorrect repairs after a tailstrike== *China Airlines Flight 611 ASN Aircraft Accident Boeing 747-209B B-18255 Penghu Islands, Taiwan [Taiwan Strait]\" Aviation Safety Network.
