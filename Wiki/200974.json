 "text": "Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, by the end of his life it was Ingres's portraits, both painted and drawn, that were recognized as his greatest legacy. == Gallery == Image:Ingres, Self-portrait.jpg|Self- portrait at age 24, 1804, Musée Condé Image:IngresOdipusAndSphinx.jpg|Oedipus and the Sphinx, 1808, Louvre Image:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - La Baigneuse Valpinçon.jpg|The Valpinçon Bather, 1808, Louvre Image:Ingres Marcotte d-Argenteuil.jpg|Marcotte d'Argenteuil, 1810, National Gallery of Art Image:Ingres Mademoiselle Jeanne Suzanne Catherine Gonin.jpg|Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin, 1821 Taft Museum of Art Image:Ingres Madame Marie Marcotte.jpg|Madame Marie Marcotte, 1826, Louvre Image:Louise de Broglie by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres.jpg|Louise de Broglie, Countess d'Haussonville, 1845, Frick Collection Image:Ingres_Princess_Albert_de_Broglie.jpg|Princesse Albert de Broglie, née Joséphine-Eléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn, 1853, Metropolitan Museum of Art Image:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres - The Spring - Google Art Project 2.jpg|The Source, 1856, Musée d'Orsay Image:Dominique Ingres - Mme Moitessier.jpg|Mme.
