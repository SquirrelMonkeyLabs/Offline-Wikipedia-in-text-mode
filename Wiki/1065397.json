The Myanmar Police Force, the Border Guard Forces, the Myanmar Coast Guard, and the People's Militia Units are also part of it. Following the violent repression of nationwide protests in 1988, the military agreed to free elections in 1990. When the National League for Democracy won they ignored their victory and imprisoned its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. ==References== Category:Organizations based in Myanmar Category:Military by country",
