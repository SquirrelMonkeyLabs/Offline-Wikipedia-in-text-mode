 "text": "The confusing green bush frog or variable bush frog (Raorchestes chromasynchysi) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 800 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in a special kind of forest called a shola forest. These forests are high in the hills, and they have evergreen trees and shrubs. People have also seen it on coffee and cardamom farms. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in a few small places, because it is hard for the frogs to move between those places, and because human beings still change those faces, especially to make coffee farms. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
