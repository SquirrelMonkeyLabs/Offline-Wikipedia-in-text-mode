 "text": "Iron(III) nitrate, also known as ferric nitrate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Fe(NO3)3. It contains iron in its +3 oxidation state. It also contains nitrate ions. ==Properties== Iron(III) nitrate is a light purple solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is an oxidizing agent. It is acidic. It absorbs water easily to make a hydrate (chemical with water molecules attached to it). ==Preparation== It is made by reacting iron or iron(III) oxide with nitric acid. The reaction of iron with nitric acid makes nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is a brown and toxic gas. ==Uses== It is used to etch silver alloys. It is also used to make sodium amide. It acts as a catalyst in this reaction. It can be mixed with clay to make an oxidant clay. This oxidant clay can be used to make organic molecules. ==Safety== Iron(III) nitrate is oxidizing, so it can catch things on fire. It is also corrosive to metal and can burn skin. ==Related pages== *Iron(III) chloride *Iron(III) sulfate Category:Nitrates Category:Iron compounds",
