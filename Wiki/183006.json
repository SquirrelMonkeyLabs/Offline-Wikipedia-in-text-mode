 "text": "In photosynthesis, a light-independent reaction takes place in plant chloroplasts. In this process, sugars are made from carbon dioxide. The process, known as the Calvin cycle, uses products of the light-dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) and various enzymes. Therefore, the light- independent reaction cannot happen without the light-dependent reaction. Sugars made in the light-independent reactions are moved around the plant (translocation). This takes place in the grana region of the chloroplast. It is anaerobic (does not use oxygen). == The Calvin cycle == #A sugar (Ribulose biphosphate or RuBP) made of 5 carbon atoms combines with carbon dioxide to form a 6-carbon sugar (phosphoglycerate). An enzyme called RuBisCO speeds this reaction up. #Phosphoglycerate is reduced with hydrogen atoms from the light- dependent reaction to form two molecules of triose phosphate (each has 3 carbon atoms). ATP is needed for this to occur. #Some triose phosphate is converted (using ATP) back into Ribulose Biphosphate (which is why this is called a cycle). #The rest left over is used to produce glucose. The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following: :3 + 6 NADPH + 5 + 9 ATP â†’ glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) + 2 H+ \\+ 6 NADP+ \\+ 9 ADP + 8 Pi (Pi = inorganic phosphate) == Other websites== *The biochemistry of the Calvin cycle.
