 "text": "Scrotifera is a group of living things in the class Mammalia. It is a proposed clade, meaning that not all scientists use it when they talk about how living things are related to each other. The orders Carnivora (carnivores), Chiroptera (bats), Perissodactyla (hoofed animals with odd numbers of toes, for example horses and rhinos), Cetartiodactyla (hoofed animals with even numbers of toes), Philodota (pangolins), and Meridiungulata are all in Scrotifera. == References == Category:Taxonomy Category:Mammals",
