After the death of Margaret of Scotland in 1290, John Balliol was one of three major competitors for the throne. King Edward concluded that he was going to pick Balliol as king of Scotland at Scone, 30th November, 1292, St. Andrew's Day. Edward I steadily undermined the authority of King John. He treated Balliol like a 'Puppet King' and the Scots were not happy. At the Battle of Dunbar King Edward's men slaughtered and wiped out the town of Berwick killing around 8000 people in the brutal killing. He was stripped of his authority as king and was sent away to France by King Edward. He later died there. His son Edward Balliol would later claim the Scottish throne from 1332 until 1356.
