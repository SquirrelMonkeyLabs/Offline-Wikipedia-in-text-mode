 "text": "Lionel Andrés Messi (; born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer. As of summer 2023, he plays for the Argentina national team and American club Inter Miami. At club level, he is best known for playing for FC Barcelona. Messi is widely recognized as one of the best players of all time. His playing style and skills have been compared to the Argentine legend Diego Maradona. There is much competition between him and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. In 2009, Messi was included in the \"World Player of the Decade 2000s\", ranking second behind Ronaldinho but ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo (who came third). Messi has played alongside many football greats, such as Ronaldinho, Deco, Samuel Eto'o, Luis Suárez, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, and Neymar. At FC Barcelona, Messi, Neymar and Suarez were known as MSN. == Early life == Messi was born at Hospital Provincial de Rosario in Rosario, Argentina. Messi is the third of four children of Jorge Messi and his wife Celia Cuccittini. He has two brothers named Rodrigo and Matias and two cousins named Maximiliano and Emanuel. Messi's grandmother died when he was 12, and after that he generally celebrates his goals by pointing up in the sky in tribute of his grandmother. == Club career == === Barcelona === Messi began football at a young age and his potential was quickly seen by Barcelona. He left Newell's Old Boys' youth team in September 2000 and moved with his family to Europe in February 2001. He officially signed with Barcelona in December 2000 on a napkin. They moved to Spain because Barcelona offered their help to treat his growth hormone deficiency, and Newell's didn't offer any help. Messi played his first professional match at 17 years old on 16 November 2003 against Porto. He played the 2003-04 season with the Barcelona B team. He was promoted to the A team for the 2004-05 season, and made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol as a substitute. He made his league debut at age 17, and became the youngest player to play for Barcelona's first team in an official competition. He scored his first professional goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete Balompie from a sublime assist by Ronaldinho. The goal made him the youngest-ever scorer for the club at that time. Barcelona won the La Liga that season for the first time in 6 years, and won the league for a second time in a row along with the Spanish Super Cup and UEFA Champions League in 2006. His first breakthrough season was in the 2006–07 season; he became a first team regular by scoring his first hat-trick of his career in El Clásico. On 18 April 2007, he scored a goal almost exactly identical to Maradona's \"Goal of the Century\" against England in the 1986 World Cup, where Maradona got the ball behind the halfway line on the right side and beat 4 defenders and the goalie to score. Messi's goal was similar to this; he received a pass from Xavi on the right side behind half-field, and then nut-megged an opponent and 4 others including the goalie before finishing off with his right foot inside the penalty box. In 2019, Barcelona fans voted it as the best goal in the club's history, receiving 45% of votes. After Ronaldinho left the club at the end of the 2007-08 season, Messi was handed the number 10 shirt. The 2008-09 season was arguably one of the most successful seasons in his stellar career. In this season, Messi scored 38 goals in all competitions, including one in the Champions League final against Manchester United that Barcelona won 2–0 as part of their treble. In the following 2009–10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all competitions. That levelled to Ronaldo Nazario's record total for Barcelona. Messi also won his first Ballon d'Or in December 2009, and also won his second a year later. He scored again in the 2011 Champions League final against their same opponent two years earlier, Manchester United. Barcelona won 3-1. Messi won his third Ballon d'Or in a row that year. === Paris Saint- Germain === Messi joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in August 2021 after spending his entire professional career at FC Barcelona. The transfer was one of the most significant moments in football history, as Messi sought a new chapter following Barcelona's financial troubles that prevented his contract renewal. At PSG, he was reunited with former teammate Neymar and formed a highly anticipated attacking trio alongside Kylian Mbappé. Messi's first season at PSG (2021–22) was marked by an adjustment period as he adapted to a new league and environment. In Ligue 1, he scored 6 goals and provided 14 assists in 26 appearances, a notable contribution but below his usual prolific standards. However, he excelled as a playmaker and displayed moments of brilliance. In the UEFA Champions League, Messi scored 5 goals in the group stage, including a memorable strike against Manchester City. Despite PSG winning the Ligue 1 title, their campaign was marred by a disappointing Round of 16 exit in the Champions League against Real Madrid. The 2022–23 season saw Messi return to his best form in France, showcasing his ability as both a scorer and creator. He scored 16 goals and registered 16 assists in 32 Ligue 1 matches, establishing himself as one of the league's top performers. His partnership with Neymar and Mbappé, often dubbed the \"MNM trio,\" delivered numerous highlights, although the team's overall success was mixed. PSG retained their Ligue 1 title, but another Champions League Round of 16 exit, this time to Bayern Munich, overshadowed their domestic dominance. Messi's tenure at PSG concluded in June 2023, with the Argentine announcing his departure after two seasons. In total, he won two Ligue 1 titles and contributed significantly to the team's domestic success, but the club's continued failures in European competition remained a key narrative. === Inter Miami === On 7 June 2023, Messi confirmed in an interview that he was joining Inter Miami of Major League Soccer (MLS). == International career == === Argentina === Messi was allowed to play for both Spain and Argentina since he had dual-nationality, but he decided to play for his home country, Argentina. He led the team to the final game of the 2005 U-20 World Cup by scoring important goals in the knockout stages. Messi scored two goals in the final against Nigeria, and Argentina won 2–1. In addition to receiving a winner's medal, Messi was also awarded the Golden Shoe for most goals scored (6), and Golden Ball for best player. Messi played his first game with the senior team on 17 August 2005 against Hungary. He came on as a substitute. However, he was shown a red card 45 seconds into the game for hitting an opponent in the face on accident while Messi was trying to pull the opponent off from his shirt. Messi scored his first goal for Argentina in a friendly match against Croatia on 1 March 2006. Argentina lost the game 3-2. He was selected for the 2006 World Cup by coach José Pekerman. In Argentina's second game against Serbia, he became their youngest player to play at a World Cup. He also assisted a goal scored the last one in the 6–0 victory. That goal made him the youngest goalscorer in the 2006 World Cup. Messi won the 2008 Olympics with Argentina as well, as he assisted Ángel Di Maria's goal in the final against Nigeria in Beijing. Messi was made captain of the national team in 2011. He scored his first hat-trick with the country in his 68th appearance during a 3-1 victory against Switzerland in February 2012. On 21 June 2016, he broke the top scoring record for Argentina by scoring his 55th goal with a gem of a free- kick against the United States in the Copa América Centenario. It was regarded as the best free-kick scored by Messi during his career. The record was previously held by Gabriel Batistuta with 54 goals. ==== Retirement ==== On 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties 4-2 in the Copa América Centenario final after a 0–0 tie. Messi missed his penalty in the penalty shootout. This was Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. A day after the match, Messi announced his retirement from international football. In an emotional interview after the game, he said he was very sad that he missed the penalty and also sad that he wasn't able to win any trophies in four finals. ==== Return from Retirement ==== He came out of retirement in October 2016 for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. After a slow start to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, he helped Argentina qualify to the next round of the competition by scoring the first goal in the 2-1 win over Nigeria. Jumping to 2021 with the new coach, Lionel Scaloni, Argentina won the Copa America in June. With Dimaria's goal in the 11th minute, they beat Brazil 1-0 in their home ground. Which was one of the main reasons for Messi winning the Ballon dO'r for the record 7th time and counting. In the mid-year of 2022, Messi and the Argentina team along with Lionel Scaloni beat Italy 3-0 and won the Finalissma trophy. In the winter of 2022, Messi won the World Cup after scoring 7 goals and providing 3 assists as well as winning the player of the tournament. == Personal life == === Relationships === Messi has three children with his wife Antonella Roccuzzo. They are named Thiago Messi, Mateo Messi and Ciro Messi. Thiago was born on 2 November 2012, Mateo was born on 11 September 2015 and Ciro was born on 10 March 2018. On the bottom of Messi's cleats is the name of his first son, Thiago. Messi and Antonella married in June 2017. === Charity === When not playing on the field, Messi finds time to do charity work. He started the Leo Messi Foundation in 2007 which helps children in at-risk situations. Messi also opened a kids park for children living in a hospital in Barcelona. He also donated 1 million euros for the Covid-19 virus in Barcelona. === Tax Issues === In July 2016 he was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to spend 21 months in prison. Messi was also fined two million Euros. Messi never went to prison, and the problem was be solved with probation. He told the court he \"only played football\" and didn't know anything because he left his money problems to be dealt with by his father, Jorge Messi. == Goal Stats == Game Shoot accuracy Number of shoots for each game Average distance of shoots Assist per game 1 40 5 18 1 2 50 4 20 0 3 30 6 22 1 4 45 5 19 2 5 60 3 17 0 6 55 4 21 1 7 35 6 23 0 8 70 3 16 2 9 65 4 18 1 10 50 5 20 0 11 27 4 19 1 12 24 5 21 2 13 29 3 18 0 14 20 6 22 1 15 33 4 17 2 16 30 3 20 0 17 23 5 19 1 18 26 4 21 1 19 31 3 18 1 20 28 5 20 2 == Club career statistics == Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League League League Copa del Rey Copa del Rey Champions League Champions League Other Other Total Total Club Season Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Barcelona C 2003–04 Tercera División 10 5 — — — — — — 10 5 Barcelona B 2003–04 Segunda División B 5 0 — — — — — — 5 0 Barcelona B 2004–05 Segunda División B 17 6 — — — — — — 17 6 Barcelona B Total Total 22 6 — — — — — — 22 6 Barcelona 2004–05 La Liga 7 1 1 0 1 0 — — 9 1 Barcelona 2005–06 La Liga 17 6 2 1 6 1 0 0 25 8 Barcelona 2006–07 La Liga 26 14 2 2 5 1 3 0 36 17 Barcelona 2007–08 La Liga 28 10 3 0 9 6 — — 40 16 Barcelona 2008–09 La Liga 31 23 8 6 12 9 — — 51 38 Barcelona 2009–10 La Liga 35 34 3 1 11 8 4 4 53 47 Barcelona 2010–11 La Liga 33 31 7 7 13 12 2 3 55 53 Barcelona 2011–12 La Liga 37 50 7 3 11 14 5 6 60 73 Barcelona 2012–13 La Liga 32 46 5 4 11 8 2 2 50 60 Barcelona 2013–14 La Liga 31 28 6 5 7 8 2 0 46 41 Barcelona 2014–15 La Liga 38 43 6 5 13 10 — — 57 58 Barcelona 2015–16 La Liga 33 26 5 5 7 6 4 4 49 41 Barcelona 2016–17 La Liga 34 37 7 5 9 11 2 1 52 54 Barcelona 2017–18 La Liga 36 34 6 4 10 6 2 1 54 45 Barcelona 2018–19 La Liga 34 36 5 3 10 12 1 0 50 51 Barcelona 2019–20 La Liga 26 21 2 2 6 2 1 1 35 26 Barcelona Total Total 478 440 75 53 141 114 28 22 722 629 Career total Career total Career total 510 451 75 53 141 114 28 22 754 640 ==International career statistics== Appearances and goals by national team, year and competition Team Year Competitive Competitive Friendly Friendly Total Total Team Year Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Argentina 2005 3 0 2 0 5 0 Argentina 2006 3 1 4 1 7 2 Argentina 2007 10 4 4 2 14 6 Argentina 2008 6 1 2 1 8 2 Argentina 2009 8 1 2 2 10 3 Argentina 2010 5 0 5 2 10 2 Argentina 2011 8 2 5 2 13 4 Argentina 2012 5 5 4 7 9 12 Argentina 2013 5 3 2 3 7 6 Argentina 2014 7 4 7 4 14 8 Argentina 2015 6 1 2 3 8 4 Argentina 2016 10 8 1 0 11 8 Argentina 2017 5 4 2 0 7 4 Argentina 2018 4 1 1 3 5 4 Argentina 2019 6 1 4 4 10 5 Argentina 2020 4 1 0 0 4 1 Argentina Total 95 37 47 34 180 106 == Honours == === Club === BarcelonaLionel Messi at Barcelona's official website * La Liga: 2004–05, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19 * Copa del Rey: 2008–09, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2020-21 * Supercopa de España: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018 * UEFA Champions League: 2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15 * UEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015 * FIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015 === International === Argentina U20 * FIFA U-20 World Cup: 2005 Argentina Olympic team * Summer Olympics: 2008 Argentina Senior team * Copa America: 2021, 2024 * FIFA World Cup: 2022 === Individual === * Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023 * FIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 2014, 2022 * FIFA World Player of the Year: 2009 * The Best FIFA Men's Player: 2019 * European Golden Shoe: 2009–10, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19 * Copa América Golden Ball: 2015 * UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award: 2011, 2015 * UEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 2009 * UEFA Club Forward of the Year: 2009, 2019 * La Liga Best Player: 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2014–15 * La Liga Best Forward: 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16 * Trofeo Alfredo Di Stéfano (best player in Spain): 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2014–15, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19 * Pichichi Trophy: 2009–10, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20“Messi Wins Sixth Pichichi Trophy, Extends Lead in European Golden Boot Race”.
