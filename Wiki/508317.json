It is also a common name for the epoxide functional group, and a common name for a type of strong adhesive used for sticking things together.Definition of epoxy resin, noun, from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary & Thesaurus, Cambridge University Press. Typically, two resins need to be mixed together before use. Epoxy resins are a class of reactive polymers which contain epoxide groups. Their co-reactants are often called 'hardeners' or 'curatives', and the cross- linking reaction is referred to as 'curing'. The reaction forms a thermosetting polymer, often with strong mechanical properties as well as high temperature and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of industrial applications. *Superglue is another strong adhesive, made of cyanoacrylate. == Notes == Category:Epoxides Category:Synthetic materials Category:Adhesives",
