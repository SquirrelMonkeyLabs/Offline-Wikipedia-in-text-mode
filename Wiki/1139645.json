 "text": "On 1 October 2024, Israel began an invasion of southern Lebanon as part of the ongoing Israel–Hezbollah conflict, a result of the Israel–Hamas war. It happened after a series of major attacks on Hezbollah in September that weakened them. This included the explosions of its communication devices. Israeli airstrikes also targeted Hezbollah's infrastructure across southern Lebanon. These attacks also led in the 27 September assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. According to Israel, the invasion is to take out Hezbollah's forces and power that could be a threat to civilian communities in northern Israel. Israel also said that the Iran-supported group was preparing for an attack similar to the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel. ==References== Category:October 2024 events Category:2024 in Lebanon Category:November 2024 events Category:December 2024 events Category:January 2025 events Category:February 2025 events Category:Israel–Hamas war Category:Hezbollah",
