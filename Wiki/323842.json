 "text": "The Army Cadet Force (ACF) is a youth organisation in the United Kingdom where members train in military skills. It was founded in 1859, and had its official 150th birthday in 2010, marked by the Cadet 150 celebrations. The ACF gives a lot of youth in the UK an ability to change their lives with the opportunities it offers for little money. The ACF offers many activities such as the Summer Mountain Foundation Course (SMF). A lot of these skills can be used in both civilian and military life. In the Army Cadets, cadets will progress through a rank structure which will improve the cadetsâ€™ team work and leadership skills while they are under pressure. In the summer the ACF offers the opportunity for cadets to attend Annual Camp. On Annual Camp cadets will take part in hiking, fieldcraft and combat training exercises among many more activities. == References == Category:Youth organizations",
