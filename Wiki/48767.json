Retrieved 25 April 2008 They are different from the arts and humanities, and application of the scientific method is important. Most of the social sciences require doing a lot of research, such as making surveys. Such research is called \"social research\". Some subjects, such as history, are sometimes social sciences and sometimes humanities.
