 "text": "Self-ownership is a term which was first used in libertarianism and anarchism. It is the idea that a person has the right to decide about his or her own body, and about his or her way of life. It is also used to say that people have the right to keep what they earn through work (unless they made a contract to give it to someone else). The word was first used at the end of the 19th century. It was also used in other kinds of philisophy. Bodily integrity is a direct consequence of self-ownership. Category:Liberalism Category:Anarchism",
