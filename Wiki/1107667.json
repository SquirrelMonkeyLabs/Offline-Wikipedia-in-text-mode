He completed his education in the U.S. He joined the US Air Force Reserve after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US. == Community work == In 2009, Edwards played a big role in preventing the sale of an old cemetery in Kampala, Uganda. This cemetery, called the Kampala European Cemetery, was where many important people from Uganda’s past, including some of Edwards’ family, were buried. Some people wanted to buy the cemetery to build a shopping mall there, but Edwards didn’t want that to happen. He started a protest and got a lot of people involved. Because of the attention from the local news and the community’s support, the cemetery was saved from being sold. It was also recognized as a historical place that needed to be protected. == Medical work == Edwards’ medical practice focuses on managing the patients' pain and restoring them back to good function. == References == Category:Living people Category:People from Kampala Category:American physicians Category:Scientists from Texas",
