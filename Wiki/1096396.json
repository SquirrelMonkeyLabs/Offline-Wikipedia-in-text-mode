 "text": "Lepidotes (from lepidōtós, 'covered with scales') is an extinct genus of prehistoric ray-finned fish. Fossils have been found in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. It is a member of the Lepidotidae and has long been called a wastebasket taxon. It was originally called Lepidotus. == Description == Lepidotes was 30 cm (12 in) long. It is one example of a fish that didn't have the upper jawbones attached to the jugal bone. Some fish still have this feature, such as carp from the family Cyprinidae. It had a scaly and slightly elongated body. It had shiny scales with just a few punctures. Lepidotes likely ate soft-bodied animals, as shown from stomach contents. It lived in both freshwater lakes and shallow seas. == Taxonomy == === Species === Four species are known: * †Lepidotes elvensis Blainville, 1818 * †Lepidotes gigas Agassiz, 1832 (type species) * †Lepidotes semiserratus Agassiz, 1836 * †Lepidotes bülowianus Jaekel, 1929 === Synonyms === * Lepidosaurus Meyer, 1833 * Lepidotus (former name) * Serobodus Münster, 1812 * Sphaerodus Agassiz, 1833 * Plesiodus Wagner, 1863 * Prolepidotus Zeitschr, 1983 == Some species == === Lepidotes gigas === Lepidotes gigas is the type species of this genus. It is known from the Lower Jurassic of Germany. === Lepidotes bülowianus === Lepidotes bülowianus is another species of this genus. It is known from the Lower Jurassic of Germany. == Reassigned species == Lepidotes latifrons is now a species of Isanichthys. Most of the species have been reassigned to Scheenstia. As a result, only four species are found in this genus == Related pages == * Scheenstia == References == # López-Arbarello, Adriana (2012-07-11).
