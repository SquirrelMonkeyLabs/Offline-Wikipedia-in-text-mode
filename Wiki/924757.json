Woods was also the chair of the Chicago Committee to Free Angela Davis. Angela Davis was an African American politician who was in prison for crimes she didn't commit. == Early life == Sylvia Woods was born in New Orleans. Some of her views on life and labor rights were inspired by her father, a follower of Marcus Garvey and a military trade unionist. When Woods was 16, she moved to Chicago to find work. Due to the Great Depression, jobs were hard to get. Woods still managed to get a job at the Great Western Laundry on the Near West Side. Later on, she would stage her first strike at the laundry. == References == Category:1909 births Category:Year of death missing Category:African-American people Category:American activists Category:People from New Orleans",
