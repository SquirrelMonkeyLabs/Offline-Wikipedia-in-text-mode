 "text": "A sanctuary city is a city that does not help its country's immigration police. Sanctuary cities say they wish to cut down fear of deportation and possible family breakups with people who are in a country illegally. That's so that such people may be willing to report a crime and send their children to school. Some states, such as Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Georgia, Missouri and Florida do not allow sanctuary cities. Others, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois New York, Colorado and California allow sanctuary cities. In early 2018, a Chicago federal judge said that the Trump administration could not withhold public safety grants to sanctuary cities. Those decisions were seen as a setback to the Trump administration efforts for helping authorities police illegal immigrants. The issue of legality for such actions remain in the context of the expected second presidency of Donald Trump. ==References== Category:Migration laws",
