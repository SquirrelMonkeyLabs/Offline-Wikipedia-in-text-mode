 "text": "A nutritional rating system tries to communicate the nutritional value of food in a simple way: Foods are ranked, foods that have a higher \"score\", get a better ranking. In the end, the ranking is communicated with a label and a color. Some of these systems are targeted at a specific audience. Some systems use stars or points to rate the general nutritional value, other systems only look at certain attributes, for example cholesterol or sugar content. Category:Nutrition",
