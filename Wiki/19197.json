 "text": "The Hart Trophy is given to the most valuable player of the National Hockey League every year. It was given to the NHL by Dr. David Hart, father of NHL coach and manager Cecil Hart. It was first awarded in 1924. Wayne Gretzky has won the most Hart Trophies with nine, followed by Gordie Howe with six and Eddie Shore with four. Howie Morenz, Bobby Orr, Bobby Clarke, Alex Ovechkin, and Mario Lemieux have won the award three times each. The closest vote for the trophy was in 2002, when Jose Theodore and Jarome Iginla tied; Theodore won because he had more first-place votes. In 1999, Chris Pronger won by one point over Jaromir Jagr; and in 1990, Mark Messier won by two points over Ray Bourque. ==Winners== Positions key C Centre LW Left Wing D Defence RW Right Wing G Goaltender Season Winner Team Position Win # 1923–24 Ottawa Senators C 1 1924–25 Hamilton Tigers C 1 1925–26 Montreal Maroons C 1 1926–27 Montreal Canadiens D 1 1927–28 Montreal Canadiens C 1 1928–29 New York Americans G 1 1929–30 Montreal Maroons C 2 1930–31 Montreal Canadiens C 2 1931–32 Montreal Canadiens C 3 1932–33 Boston Bruins D 1 1933–34 Montreal Canadiens LW 1 1934–35 Boston Bruins D 2 1935–36 Boston Bruins D 3 1936–37 Montreal Canadiens D 1 1937–38 Boston Bruins D 4 1938–39 Montreal Canadiens LW 1 1939–40 Detroit Red Wings D 1 1940–41 Boston Bruins C 1 1941–42 Brooklyn Americans D 1 1942–43 Boston Bruins C 2 1943–44 Toronto Maple Leafs D 1 1944–45 Montreal Canadiens C 1 1945–46 Chicago Black Hawks C 1 1946–47 Montreal Canadiens RW 1 1947–48 New York Rangers C 1 1948–49 Detroit Red Wings C 1 1949–50 New York Rangers G 1 1950–51 Boston Bruins C 1 1951–52 Detroit Red Wings RW 1 1952–53 Detroit Red Wings RW 2 1953–54 Chicago Black Hawks G 1 1954–55 Toronto Maple Leafs C 1 1955–56 Montreal Canadiens C 1 1956–57 Detroit Red Wings RW 3 1957–58 Detroit Red Wings RW 4 1958–59 New York Rangers RW 1 1959–60 Detroit Red Wings RW 5 1960–61 Montreal Canadiens RW 1 1961–62 Montreal Canadiens G 1 1962–63 Detroit Red Wings RW 6 1963–64 Montreal Canadiens C 2 1964–65 Chicago Black Hawks LW 1 1965–66 Chicago Black Hawks LW 2 1966–67 Chicago Black Hawks C 1 1967–68 Chicago Black Hawks C 2 1968–69 Boston Bruins C 1 1969–70 Boston Bruins D 1 1970–71 Boston Bruins D 2 1971–72 Boston Bruins D 3 1972–73 Philadelphia Flyers C 1 1973–74 Boston Bruins C 2 1974–75 Philadelphia Flyers C 2 1975–76 Philadelphia Flyers C 3 1976–77 Montreal Canadiens RW 1 1977–78 Montreal Canadiens RW 2 1978–79 New York Islanders C 1 1979–80 Edmonton Oilers C 1 1980–81 Edmonton Oilers C 2 1981–82 Edmonton Oilers C 3 1982–83 Edmonton Oilers C 4 1983–84 Edmonton Oilers C 5 1984–85 Edmonton Oilers C 6 1985–86 Edmonton Oilers C 7 1986–87 Edmonton Oilers C 8 1987–88 Pittsburgh Penguins C 1 1988–89 Los Angeles Kings C 9 1989–90 Edmonton Oilers C 1 1990–91 St. Louis Blues RW 1 1991–92 New York Rangers C 2 1992–93 Pittsburgh Penguins C 2 1993–94 Detroit Red Wings C 1 1994–95 Philadelphia Flyers C 1 1995–96 Pittsburgh Penguins C 3 1996–97 Buffalo Sabres G 1 1997–98 Buffalo Sabres G 2 1998–99 Pittsburgh Penguins RW 1 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues D 1 2000–01 Colorado Avalanche C 1 2001–02 Montreal Canadiens G 1 2002–03 Colorado Avalanche C 1 2003–04 Tampa Bay Lightning RW 1 2004–05 2005–06 Boston Bruins/San Jose Sharks C 1 2006–07 Pittsburgh Penguins C 1 2007–08 Washington Capitals LW 1 2008–09 Washington Capitals LW 2 2009–10 Vancouver Canucks C 1 2010–11 Anaheim Ducks RW 1 2011–12 Pittsburgh Penguins C 1 2012–13 Washington Capitals RW 3 2013–14 Pittsburgh Penguins C 2 2014–15 Montreal Canadiens G 1 2015–16 Chicago Blackhawks RW 1 2016–17 Edmonton Oilers C 1 2017–18 New Jersey Devils LW 1 2018–19 Tampa Bay Lightning RW 1 2019–20 Edmonton Oilers C 1 2020–21 Edmonton Oilers C 2 2021–22 Toronto Maple Leafs C 1 2022–23 Edmonton Oilers C 3 2023–24 Colorado Avalanche C 1 ==Related pages== *List of NHL players *List of NHL statistical leaders Category:National Hockey League trophies and awards",
