 "text": "In statistics, the sample size of a sample is the number of observations that make up it. It is usually denoted as n, a positive integer (natural number). For large sample sizes of 30 or more, statistics describing the samples tend to be more reliable. As a result, statistical analysis is easier with large samples than with small samples. In research, sample sizes are often calculated before the experiment are conducted to make sure that the desired conditions can be met. == Related pages == * Central limit theorem * Law of large numbers * Standard error == References == Category:Statistics de:Zufallsstichprobe#Stichprobenumfang",
