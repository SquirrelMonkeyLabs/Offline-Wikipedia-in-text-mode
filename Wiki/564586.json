At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives.

In response, English announced that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. However, on 19 October 2017, Jacinda Ardern became the next Prime Minister after Winston Peters announced he would enter a coalition government with Labour. ==Background== Bill English is a prominent figure in New Zealand politics and corporate leadership.
