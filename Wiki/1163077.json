 "text": "Mr. Goodbar is a candy bar containing peanuts and chocolate. Its packaging is identifiable by its yellow background and red text. It is manufactured by The Hershey Company. It was introduced in 1925. Hershey switched from cocoa butter to less expensive oil alternatives in 2008. Hershey made minor changes to the product's ingredients, packaging, and description. Despite having chocolate in the recipe, these modified formulations that do not contain cocoa butter are not permitted to be lawfully marketed as milk chocolate under US-Food and Drug Administration food labeling regulations.
