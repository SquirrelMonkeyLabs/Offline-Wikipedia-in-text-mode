 "text": "Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy is a 2011 book by Benjamin K. Sovacool, published by World Scientific. Sovacoolâ€™s book explores the global nuclear power industry, its fuel cycle, nuclear accidents, environmental impacts, social risks, and economics. There is a postscript on the Japanese 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Based on detailed analysis, Sovacool concludes \"that a global nuclear renaissance would bring immense technical, economic, environmental, political, and social costs\". He says that it is renewable energy technologies which will enhance energy security, and which have many other advantages. Reviewer Mark Diesendorf says that one weakness of the book is the limited coverage of nuclear weapons proliferation. He says that governments of several countries (e.g., France, India, North Korea, Pakistan) have used nuclear power and/or research reactors to assist nuclear weapons development. ==Related pages== *List of books about nuclear issues *List of books about renewable energy *Nuclear or Not? *Reaction Time (book) *Non-Nuclear Futures ==References== ==Other websites== *Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power at World Scientific. *Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power at Google Books. *Nuclear Power's Global Expansion: Weighing Its Costs and Risks Category:2011 books Category:Books about nuclear issues",
