 "text": "Unhexoctium (), also known as eka-flerovium, dvi-lead, or element 168, is the possible chemical element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uho and has the atomic number 168. Due to instabilities, it is not known if this element is physically possible, but if possible, Unhexoctium is predicted to be the last period 8 element in group 14. It should have an atomic mass around 490. As of October 2022, no attempt has ever been made to make Unhexoctium, nor has any plans been made known to attempt to make Unhexoctium. == Naming == The name Unhexoctium is a systematic element name, used as a placeholder until it is confirmed by other research groups and the IUPAC decides on a name. Usually, the name suggested by the discoverer(s) is chosen. == Stability == Unhexoctium is highly likely to be too unstable to be detected, which would allow very little study of it. == Predicted chemistry == Unhexoctium is probably a post-transition metal, although it might be a noble gas. A likely oxidation state is +4, based on the oxidation states of Flerovium and Lead. == Related pages == * Unhexseptium - Unseptbium * Post- transition metal * Flerovium * Lead == References == Category:Hypothetical chemical elements",
