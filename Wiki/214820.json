 "text": "Didcot is a town in Oxfordshire about south of Oxford. Until 1974 it was part of Berkshire. ==History and economy== During the Roman Empire the Romans dug a ditch that runs north through what is now known as the Ladygrove area north of the town near Long Wittenham. Didcot first appears in historical records in the 13th century as Dudcotte, Berkshire. Parts of the original village still exist in the Lydalls Road area and part of All Saints' Church dates back to the 11th century. ===Railways=== The Great Western Railway, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, reached Didcot in 1839. In 1844 the Didcot railway station was opened. The original station burnt down in the later part of 19th century. Didcot is junction of the routes to London, Bristol and Oxford. It was formerly a junction for Southampton via the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway but that closed in the 1960s. The traffic to Southampton meant that the town had strategic importance to military logistics, in particular during the First World War campaign on the Western Front and the Second World War preparations for D-Day. ===Power stations=== The Didcot Power Stations (which are next to each other, and actually in Sutton Courtenay) supply electricity to the National Grid. The power station has also proved a popular man-made object for local photographers. One power station was closed in 2013 and has been demolished. The other is still operating in 2018. ==Further reading== * * * ==Other websites== *Didcot Twinning Association *Didcot Railway Centre *Didcot.com community website *Didcot First *Didcot Town FC *Future Didcot *Cornerstone arts centre *The Didcot Herald * Didcot Choral Society Category:South Oxfordshire Category:Towns in Oxfordshire Category:Civil parishes in Oxfordshire Category:13th-century establishments in England",
