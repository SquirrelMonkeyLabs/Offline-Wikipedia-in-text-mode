 "text": "New Shoreham is a town off the coast of Rhode Island. New Shoreham is in Washington County, Rhode Island. It extends over exactly the same area as Block Island. The town was settled in 1637. It was later incorporated in 1672. It was named for Shoreham, Kent in England. At the 2020 United States Census, there were 1,410 people living in New Shoreham. The place is the most southern in Rhode Island and the state's Washington County. ==History== On September 21, 1938 a very strong hurricane (either category three or four) brought a storm surge onto Block Island. Two fishermen were killed by strong waves that hit Block Island. Winds, however, caused the most damage. Those winds were 91 miles per hour when the hurricane affected Block Island. Almost sixteen years later, in late August 1954, Hurricane Carol moved across eastern New England. Although not anywhere as deadly as the 1938 violent storm, Carol caused more damage. That tropical cyclones' name was permanently retired due to damage when it ran through New England. On August 19, 1991, Hurricane Bob crossed eastern New England. Bob's path was mostly similar to Carol's. The storm ran across Block Island before it moved into New England. Though Bob was category 2, it was more damaging than either Carol or the 1938 hurricane. Bob's damage was almost $1.5 billion. ==References== Category:Towns in Rhode Island Category:18th-century establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:1745 establishments",
