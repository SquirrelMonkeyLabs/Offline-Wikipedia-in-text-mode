 "text": "Cashtown is a census-designated place (CDP) in Franklin Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania, United States. The community was part of the Cashtown- McKnightstown CDP, until it was split into two separate CDPs for the 2010 census. As of 2020, the population of Cashtown was 453. == History == During the American Civil War, Cashtown was occupied by the Confederate States Army twice. Once in October 1862 when Confederate cavalry led by General J.E.B. Stuart occupied the town briefly. On June 28, 1863, General Robert E. Lee had invaded Pennsylvania a second time and was on his way to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital. When he received word that the Union Army of the Potomac was coming, he ordered his divisions to assemble at Cashtown. On June 30 Confederate General Henry Heth had his divisions at Cashtown and sent a division to nearby Gettysburg to forage for supplies. Without any reconnaissance to see what was ahead of them, the Confederates blundered into a Union cavalry commanded by General John Buford. This started the Battle of Gettysburg. ==Geography== Cashtown is northwest of Gettysburg in western Adams County. U.S. Route 30 bypasses the center of the community. It forms the northern edge of the CDP. Old U.S. 30, the original Lincoln Highway, is the main street of Cashtown. McKnightstown is to the east. ==References== == Other websites == *Cashtown Community Fire Dept. Category:Census-designated places in Pennsylvania",
