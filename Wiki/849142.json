 "text": "Beeston is a suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England located on a hill about 2 miles (3 km) south of the centre of the city. The start of Beeston was in the medieval period. It remained a small place for people to live until the late part of the Victorian era when it became a mostly residential area for people working in Leeds and surrounding industrial areas like Holbeck and Hunslet. When the 2011 Census was being carried out, Beeston had a population of 22,187 (which included Holbeck). Some parts of the area, around Cross Flatts Park, suffer from high levels of poverty, while areas to the centre and south are generally considered richer. Beeston is home to the Leeds United football club stadium on Elland Road and Hunslet rugby league club. ==Places of worship== Beeston has at least ten churches of many religions including Church of England, Roman Catholic, Methodist and Baptist. The Anglican churches of St Mary on Town Street and St Luke on Malvern Road were made in the 1870s, though St Mary is on the site of a much older church. The more modern church of St David Waincliffe on Dewsbury Road, made in the 1960s was designed by Geoffrey Davy and won a Hoffman Wood (Leeds) Gold Medal for Architecture. There are three mosques in Beeston, all located within the Beeston Hill area. There is also a Sikh Gurdwara. ==Notable people== The person who wrote plays Willis Hall went to Cockburn High School in Beeston as did the academic and author of The Uses of Literacy, Richard Hoggart.
