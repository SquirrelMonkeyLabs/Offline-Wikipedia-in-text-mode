 "text": "The Daily Wire is a conservative website run by Ben Shapiro. It was created by Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing when Shapiro still worked at Breitbart News. It was extremely critical of Donald Trump when Trump was running for President of the United States, though it generally reported on him more positively after he became president. The Daily Wire, has published work by Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, Andrew Klavan, Dennis Prager, Michelle Malkin, Jordan B. Peterson, Brett Cooper and John Hawkins. They have promoted Prager University, criticized the media for being too left-wing, and promoted Steven Crowder. The Daily Wire also hosts its own Streaming service which makes its own movies most of which aren’t political but some of which are like the documentary What is a Woman?. The Daily Wire also has a children’s Streaming service called Bentkey. ==Controversies== Once on Columbus Day, the Daily Wire released a cartoon about Christopher Columbus and the Native Americans which relied on racist imagery. Ben Shapiro later deleted the cartoon and apologized for it, though he said that he was on vacation when the cartoon was created. Michael Knowles also caused controversy when, during an appearance on Fox News he called Greta Thunberg a “mentally ill child” who was being “exploited by the left”. Fox News apologized for Knowles having said that. ==References== Category:News media",
