 "text": "The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team. They play in Chicago, Illinois at the United Center. The Bulls are a part of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They were named the Bulls in reference to the Chicago Union Stockyards, which was once a major business in Chicago. The current head coach is Billy Donovan. Michael Jordan played for the Chicago Bulls from 1984 until 1993 and from 1995 until 1998. Jordan, along with Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson, lead the team to six NBA championships via two three-peats. In the 21st century, Derrick Rose was the star of the Bulls (as well as the youngest player to win the MVP Award) until his injuries prevented him to play. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1966 establishments in the United States Category:1960s establishments in Illinois",
