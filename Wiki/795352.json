Abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the Earth's surface. They are among the flattest and smoothest places on Earth. Abyssal plains are believed to have lots of biodiversity. They are also play an important role in ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over hundreds or thousand years. Abyssal plains also have hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. ==References== Category:Landforms",
