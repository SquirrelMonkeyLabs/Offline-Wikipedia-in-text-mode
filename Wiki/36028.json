 "text": "The groundhog (also known as the chuck, wood-shock, groundpig, whistlepig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk, or siffleux) is a rodent. It belongs to the group of ground squirrels. Those squirrels are also known as marmots. The animal may also be called woodchuck, or whistlepig. Groundhogs dig tunnels and live underground. Groundhog holes, called burrows, are easy to recognize; they are holes, about 9.in (inches) (23 cm (centimeters)) wide which usually have large piles of dirt and rocks at the entrance. Each hole can contain tunnels leading to up to ten other holes. The tunnels are spacious and can have chambers like rooms. Groundhogs can make their homes under trees, around buildings and in open fields. == Problems == Some problems with groundhogs are that they eat crops and dig around the foundations of buildings. When groundhogs dig around buildings this can cause damage if the holes go too far under the building. == In Culture == In the United States, there is a holiday called Groundhog Day. It is celebrated on February 2 of every year.
