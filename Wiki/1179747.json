 "text": "The Chilembwe uprising was a rebellion against British colonial rule in Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) which took place in January 1915. It was led by John Chilembwe, an American-educated Baptist minister.The leaders of the revolt were mainly from an emerging black middle class. They were motivated by accusations against the British colonial system, which included forced labour, racial discrimination and new demands imposed on the African population following the outbreak of World War I. The revolt broke out in the evening of 23 January 1915. Rebels attacked the headquarters of a tea plantation, the A. L. Bruce Estates at Magomero, and killed three white settlers. A largely unsuccessful attack on a weapons store in Blantyre followed during the night. By the morning of 24 January, the colonial authorities had mobilised the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve (NVR) and called in regular troops from the King's African Rifles (KAR). After a failed attack by KAR troops on Mbombwe on 25 January, the rebels attacked a Christian mission at Nguludi and burned it down. The KAR and NVR captured Mbombwe without encountering any resistance on 26 January. Many of the rebels, including Chilembwe himself, fled towards Portuguese Mozambique, hoping to reach safety there, but many were captured. About 40 rebels were executed in the revolt's aftermath, and 300 were imprisoned; Chilembwe was shot dead by a police patrol near the border on 3 February. Although the rebellion was not successful, it is commonlyseen as i an important event in Malawian history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland, and some reforms were enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory is still very predent. Politicians form Malawi often use it in their speeches, for its symbolism. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.
