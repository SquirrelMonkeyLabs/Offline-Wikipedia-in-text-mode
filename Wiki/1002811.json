 "text": "The University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust provides adult district general hospital services for Birmingham as well as specialist treatments for all the West Midlands. It runs the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Edgbaston, Heartlands Hospital, Solihull Hospital and Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield. In 2004 it was one of the first NHS Foundation Trusts in England. It merged with the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust in 2018. This gave it a turnover of £1.6 billion and 2,700 beds across the four main hospitals In November 2022, 13.35% of nursing posts at the trust were empty, compared with an England average of 10%. In 2023 many of the staff were found to be worried about the 'toxic atmosphere and bullying at all levels of management'. Two investigations talked about a “medical patriarchy” and regular “misogynistic behaviour”. == References == Category:NHS trusts Category:Organisations based in Birmingham Category:University hospitals in the United Kingdom",
