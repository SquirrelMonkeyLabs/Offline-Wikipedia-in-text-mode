 "text": "The Nepali Congress ( ; abbr. NC) is the largest social democratic political party in Nepal. It has been the ruling party of Nepal since July 2021. The only party in Nepal to have been elected with a majority, NC formed a majority government post three elections; in 1959, 1991 and 1999. Similarly, it emerged as the single largest party from the 2013 Constituent Assembly election, and played a leading role in the promulgation of Constitution of Nepal in 2015. The party was formed in 1950 by the merger of the Nepali National Congress and the Nepal Democratic Congress along democratic socialist lines. NC prime ministers led four governments between the fall of the Rana dynasty and the start of the Panchayat era, including the first democratically-elected government of Nepal, after the 1959 general election. == Leadership == === Party presidents === * Matrika Prasad Koirala, 1950–1952 * Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, 1952–1956, 1957–1982 * Subarna Shamsher Rana, 1956–1957 * Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, 1982–1996 * Girija Prasad Koirala, 1996–2010 * Sushil Koirala, 2010–2016 * Sher Bahadur Deuba, 2016–present === Prime Ministers of Nepal === No. Prime Minister Portrait Terms in Office Legislature Cabinet Constituency Start End Tenure 1 Matrika Prasad Koirala 16 November 1951 14 August 1952 Appointed by King Tribhuvan M.P.
