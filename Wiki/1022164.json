It lives in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Tibet, Thailand, Myanmar and the Andaman Islands in India. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Mount Shiwanda in Guanxi Province, 937 meters above sea level. ==Home== This frog lives in grassy places inside forests and on the outsides of forests. It can live in places that human beings have changed, for example rice paddies. People have seen this frog between 0 and 1500 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog makes a pile of foam and lays her eggs in it. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which swim in ponds in forests and in pools of rainwater. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out soon. Sometimes people catch this frog to eat. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
