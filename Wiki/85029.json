The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was a season in which an El Ni√±o event stopped much tropical cyclone activity, especially later in the season. The season officially began on June 1, 2006, and lasted until November 30. For convenience and clarity, in the timeline below, all landfalls are bolded. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included. The graphical bar above gives a brief overview of storm activity during the season, and for convenience, the storm's maximum intensity is included as a color bar. Tropical Storm Zeta from 2005 persisted into 2006, therefore a January section has been included in the text timeline. ==Timeline of storms== ===January=== ;January 1 :*0000 UTC - The year 2006 begins with Tropical Storm Zeta still active from the previous season, making Zeta only the second cross- season North Atlantic storm ever recorded. ;January 6 :*2 a.m. AST (0600 UTC) - Tropical Storm Zeta weakens into a tropical depression. :*5 p.m. AST (2100 UTC) - The National Hurricane Center issues its last advisory on dissipating Tropical Depression Zeta, finally ending the 2005 season. ===June=== ;June 1 :*The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins. ;June 10 :*1 a.m. CDT (0600 UTC) - Tropical Depression One forms 120 nautical miles (140 miles, 220 km) south of the western tip of Cuba. :*7 p.m. CDT (0000 UTC June 11) - Tropical Depression One strengthens into Tropical Storm Alberto. ;June 13 :*12:30 p.m. EDT (1630 UTC) - Tropical Storm Alberto makes landfall near Adams Beach, Florida, with 45 mph winds. ;June 14 :*2 a.m. EDT (0600 UTC) - Tropical Storm Alberto weakens into a tropical depression. :*8 a.m. EDT (1200 UTC) - The remnants of Alberto become extratropical. :*5 p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) - The HPC issues its first and only advisory on the remnants of Tropical Depression Alberto. ===July=== ;July 17 :*0600 UTC - A previously-extratropical low pressure area becomes a tropical depression about 210 nautical miles (245 miles, 390 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts.
