 "text": "A hung parliament (also called a balanced parliament, or as a legislature under no overall control) is when no political party (or coalition that existed before) has a majority in the Westminster system of legislatures. If this isn't solved with something like a confidence and supply agreement or a new coalition, the largest party will have to form a minority government. This is bad because they can easily lose a vote of no confidence, so a government is hard to run. ==References== Category:Parliamentary procedure",
