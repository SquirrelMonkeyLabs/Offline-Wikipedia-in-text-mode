 "text": "The FAW Welsh Cup is a football competition in Wales. It is a knockout competition. It is one of the oldest football competitions, and it was first played in 1877. Wrexham are the team that have won it the most times, winning it 23 times, but now they are not allowed to play in the Welsh Cup because they play in the English football league system. Some English teams near the border with Wales were also allowed to play in the Welsh Cup in the past, such as Shrewsbury Town, who have won the Welsh Cup six times. Category:Football in Wales",
