 "text": "Zhangixalus achantharrhena is a frog. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: on Bukit Kaba and Guning Dempo mountains in Sumatra, Indonesia. Scientists think it could live in nearby mountains too. The male frog has small spikes on its body. This frog lives in tropical forests near pools and streams where the water moves slowly. People have seen this frog near tea farms. People have seen this frog between 1415 and 1575 meters above sea level. Scientists think that the female frog lays eggs in a foam nest over water and that the tadpoles fall into the water after they hatch out of the eggs. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because there are many of them alive. The frog lives in at least one protected park: Kerinci Seblat National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
