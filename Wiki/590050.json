 "text": "An ice cream van (British English) or ice cream truck (American English) is a vehicle that serves ice cream. Ice cream vans are often parked at public events, or near parks and beaches. Ice cream vans often drive near where children play such as schools and in neighbourhoods. They usually stop before going to the next street. Ice cream vans are brightly decorated and have pictures of ice creams and cartoon characters on them. Ice cream vans have a large serving hatch with a large sliding window at the side of the van. Many times the window has small pictures of the available ice creams with their prices. ==References== * == Other websites == van Category:Vans",
