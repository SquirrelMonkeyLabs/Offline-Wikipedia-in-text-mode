 "text": "A soup kitchen is a place where food is given to people who are poor. The price is usually very low or free. Soup kitchens are usually nonprofit (they do not want to make money), and they may sometimes get food from other places for a very low price. Sometimes these soup kitchens may be created during war, but other times they are only to help people. Category:Giving Category:Hunger Category:Poverty",
