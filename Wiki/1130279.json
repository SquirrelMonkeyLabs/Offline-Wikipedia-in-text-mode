 "text": "Solare is a sans serif typeface created by Nikolas Wrobel, a graphic designer from Cologne, Germany. It was first released in January 2024 by Wrobel's type foundry, Nikolas Type. The name Solare comes from the Italian words for sun and solar energy. Wrobel designed Solare to reflect the beauty of human nature and emotions by simplifying complex shapes to their basic form. Solare combines both traditional and modern design features. It has a clean and sharp aesthetic, inspired by both sans-serif and serif fonts. The typeface includes over 748 glyphs. These cover uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation marks, accents, ligatures, diacritics and symbols. Solare supports many European languages that use the Latin alphabet, as well as Japanese. It can be used in various ways, including web design, graphic design, logos, e-books, and applications. Solare typeface is available for download in OTF and WOFF file formats and is also offered as a variable font. It is proprietary software, which means it is closed source and requires users to agree to its software license terms. == Related pages == * Grand Slang * Typography * Font * Writing == Other websites == * Official website * Casa di Solare * Fonts In Use (Solare) * == References == Category:Fonts Category:Latin-script typefaces",
