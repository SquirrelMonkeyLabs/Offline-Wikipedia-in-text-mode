 "text": "The Afro-Asian tree frog (Pseudophilautus lunatus) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Handapan Ell Plains, in the eastern part of the Sinharaja World Heritage Site, 1270 meters above sea level. One adult female frog was 40.9 m long from nose to rear end. There are black spots near the eyes and white color on the chin. The skin of the frog's back is red-brown in the middle and gray-brown with black marks on the sides. The belly is gray-white in color. The toes are dark gray in color, and the tops of the toes have some yellow color. Many parts of the frog's eye are brown in color. This frog is critically endangered. There are very few of them. Scientists say this is because human beings change the places the frog lives to make farms, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with and because pollution and chemicals meant to kill pests and make crops grow can kill this frog. However, scientists say that even though there are only a few frogs, the number of frogs is staying the same, not getting smaller. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
