She was the singer of a band called The Seatbelts, which was created just to make the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack. She has worked for many Koei games sold from the late 1980s to 1990s and even for a Dreamcast game. Because she worked a lot in the Cowboy Bebop anime, the game sold by Bandai also features her work. Apart from anime and games, Kanno also makes pieces for live-action films and television commercials. She likes Grand Funk Inc. recording studio for producing for these two media. Contributions to films started in the 90s but only since 2002 has there been a trend towards the medium. Most of the latter were shown in international film festivals.
