 "text": "The Desert Eagle is a semi-automatic pistol that shoots very large handgun cartridges. There are models that can shoot the .357 Magnum, the .44 Magnum, or the .50 Action Express (AE). It is the world's most powerful semi-automatic pistol that is mass-produced and can be sold to civilians. Even though the gun is very powerful, it is not very popular for military use because it is too heavy and kicks back too hard for it to be useful in battle. However, it is a popular weapon in movies and in video games because of its size and stopping power, such as in The Matrix, RoboCop, The Boondock Saints, Counter-Strike, the Call of Duty series, Battlefield 4, Far Cry 4, the Grand Theft Auto series, and many others.
