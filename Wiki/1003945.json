 "text": "Mocha, also known as a café mocha or mochaccino, is a popular coffee drink that originated in Italy. The coffee bean in Mocha typically comes from the port of Mocha, Yemen, which has a distinct chocolate flavor. Mocha includes a shot of espresso and some steamed milk with chocolate syrup or coco-powder. The drink is served with a topping of milk foam or whipped cream. Making a mocha is similar to that of a latte with the addition of ingredients such as chocolate syrup or cocoa powder. A typical mocha might contain one part espresso, one part milk, and one part chocolate syrup. Category:Coffee",
