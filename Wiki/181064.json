 "text": "If G is a group and H a subgroup of G, x is an element in G, and h is an element in H the cosets of H in G are defined as follows: *Left coset: xH is the set of all the elements h of H multiplied by x on the left. *Right coset: Hx is the set of all the elements h of H multiplied by x on the right. When xH = Hx we say that H is normal in G. Category:Abstract algebra",
