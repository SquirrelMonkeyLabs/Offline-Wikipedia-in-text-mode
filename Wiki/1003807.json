 "text": "The automotive industry in North Korea is a branch of the national economy, with much lower production than the automotive industry in South Korea. In North Korea, motor vehicle production is focused on military and industrial goals, including construction; few private citizens own cars. It is estimated that only about 2% of the population own cars. The majority of North Koreans are not able to afford a car, and even if they could, gasoline is rationed and hard to come by. There are very few roads and even fewer cars, so even those who do have cars don’t have much opportunity to use them. The North Korean automobile industry had its origins during the Soviet era, and the DPRK began motor-vehicle production with licenses obtained from the USSR. North Korea’s first domestically produced automobiles were copies of Soviet designs, such as the GAZ-51 midi-truck, the GAZ 69 off-road four-wheel drive vehicle, and the GAZ-M20 Pobeda passenger car. The Sungri Motor Plant in Tokchon has been North Korea’s first and largest motor vehicle plant since 1950, producing urban and off-road passenger cars and small, medium, and heavy cargo, haulage, construction, and off-road trucks and buses under the names Sungri and Jaju, among others. It was the most capable plant of the North Korean automotive industry before being surpassed by Pyeonghwa Motors. Pyeonghwa Motors in Nampo is an auto manufacturing and retailing joint venture between South Korea’s Pyeonghwa Motors and the North Korea’s Ryonbong General Corp. Pyeonghwa Motors products are sold under the names Hwiparam, Bbeokgugi (Peokkugi) and Zunma: small and luxury cars, minivans, SUVs and pick-up trucks under license. However, most North Koreans are unable to own cars. Category:North Korea North Korea",
