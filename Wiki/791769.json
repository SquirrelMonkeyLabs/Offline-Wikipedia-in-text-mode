He was a member of the Fifth Parliament of the Fourth Republic for the Bawku Central Constituency between 2009 and 2013. He was a member of the New Patriotic Party. The membership of Adamu Dramani Sakande was challenged by a member of the National Democratic Congress which happened to be the government of the day. The Supreme Court of Ghana subsequently decleared the election of Adamu Dramani Sakande null and void prompting a by-election at Bawku Central. Adamu Dramani Sakande was subsequently sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. Sakande died of a long-illness at a London hospital on 22 September 2020, aged 58. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Ghanaian politicians",
