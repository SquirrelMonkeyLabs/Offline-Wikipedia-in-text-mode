 "text": "The Morell Bridge is a bridge over the Yarra River in South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia. It was built in 1899 by John Monash and J. T. N. Anderson. It was the first bridge in Victoria to be built using reinforced concrete. It has decorations on the three arch spans, including large dragons, and Victorian era lighting. The drains on the bridge are cobbled bluestone, with a single vehicle lane in the middle. The bridge is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. It was built on dry land, and the course of the Yarra River was later changed to flow under the bridge. It was first called the Anderson Street bridge, but it was named the Morell Bridge in 1936 after Sir Stephen Morell who was Lord Mayor of Melbourne between 1926 and 1928. On June 7, 1998 the bridge was closed to motor vehicles as part of the CityLink project. It is now used by cyclists and people, joining the Royal Botanic Gardens to the Olympic Park areas. ==References== Category:Bridges in Australia Category:Concrete bridges Category:Buildings and structures in Melbourne Category:1899 establishments Category:1890s establishments in Australia Category:Arch bridges",
