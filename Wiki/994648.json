 "text": "Cornufer citrinospilus is a frog. It lives in a rainforest. Scientitsts have seen it in exactly one place: the east side of New Britain Island in Papua New Guinea, between 1650 and 1700 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 29.5-32.2 mm long from nose to rear end. It has large disks on its front and back toes for climbing. The iris of its eye is brown in color. It has bright yellow marks on the sides of its body. Scientists saw that this frog looks very much like Platymantis macrosceles, but they think they are two different species of frogs because they live so far away from each other. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
