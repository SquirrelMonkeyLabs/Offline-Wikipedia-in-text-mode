 "text": "The Tatmadaw True News Information Team (; IPA: [taʔmədò tədɛ́ɰ̃m̥àɰ̃ pjɪ̀ɰ̃tɕájʔɛ́ ʔəpʰwḛ]) was the official public information group of the Tatmadaw, the armed forces of Myanmar. The team helped the military share news, respond to reports, and talk to the public and media. == History and purpose == The team was formed around 2018 to improve the Tatmadaw’s public relations. Its main goal was to give correct and clear information about military matters, explain the army’s views on security and politics, and counter false information. == Leadership == The best-known leader of the team was Major General Zaw Min Tun, a senior officer in the Myanmar Army. After the 2021 military coup, he also became the spokesperson for the State Administration Council and the Deputy Minister of Information. == Activities == The Tatmadaw True News Information Team held press conferences, made public announcements, and gave interviews. It was the main way the military communicated with the public. == Social media removal == On 21 February 2021, Facebook removed the team’s official page. Facebook said the page broke its rules many times, including rules against spreading false information and encouraging violence. == Dissolution and aftermath == After the 2021 coup, the team became inactive. Its duties were taken over by other groups under the State Administration Council. Since then, the Tatmadaw True News Information Team has not worked as a separate group. == See also == * Tatmadaw * State Administration Council * Zaw Min Tun == References ==",
