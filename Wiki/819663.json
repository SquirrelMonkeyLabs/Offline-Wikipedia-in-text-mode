 "text": "A pedestrian scramble, or 'X' crossing is also known as a diagonal crossing, Barnes dance (US), or scramble intersection / scramble corner (Canada).Highway history It is a type of crossing which temporarily stops all traffic. This lets pedestrians cross an intersection in every direction. It was first used in Canada and the United States in the late 1940s. It fell out of favor with traffic engineers, because it gave priority to pedestrians over the flow of car traffic. Its safety and benefits to pedestrians has led to its being installed in many countries recently. == References == Category:Traffic signs",
