 "text": "Guided by Voices (often called GBV) is an American indie band. Guided by Voices is very famous for making many albums. They were active between 1986 and 2004. The band reunited in 2010 but broke up again in 2014. In 2016 they reunited for a second time. The band had many members who only stayed for a while. Robert Pollard is the most important member. Before becoming a full- time musical artist, he was a teacher at an elementary school. While he was teaching, he created lots of music for the band. Robert is a solo artist today. He is a great fan of rock music. His music, and the music of Guided by Voices, is inspired by the famous British band The Beatles and different music styles like post-British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic, prog-rock, as well as punk and post-punk. ==Studio albums== * Devil Between My Toes (1987) * album (1987) * Devil Between My Toes * Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia (1989) * Same Place The Fly Got Smashed (1990) * Propeller (1992) * Vampire on Titus (1993) * Bee Thousand (1994) * Alien Lanes (1995) * Under the Bushes, Under the Stars (1996) * Tonics & Twisted Chasers (1996) * Mag Earwhig!
