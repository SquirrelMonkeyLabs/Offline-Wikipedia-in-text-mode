The International Publishers Association honored Deepan at their annual conference and called on the United Nations to do more about freedom of expression in Bangladesh. Tutul sent a message to the conference, saying: \"If Jagriti Faisal Abedin Deepan were alive today, he would play an important role in this conference. But because he published free-thinking books, Islamist fundamentalists killed him. I urge all my publisher friends to continue to publish the works of free thinkers. I believe this is the best reply to the fundamentalists. By increasing the number of people that free-thinking books can reach, we'll be able to weaken fundamentalism in Bangladesh.\" Tutal also called for freedom for Bangladeshi writer and publisher, Shamsuzzoha Manik.
