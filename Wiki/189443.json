 "text": "Otto Heinrich Warburg (October 8, 1883 - August 1, 1970) was a German chemist. After earning his doctorate degrees in medicine and chemistry, he started to investigate how oxygen is consumed by cells in a living organism. His studies led him to identify the role of the cytochromes. He won the 1931 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the respiratory enzyme. ==Cancer== In the 1920s, Warburg and his colleagues observed that tumors take up higher amounts of glucose than their surrounding tissues. Although consuming glucose is helpful for mammals because it is a nutrient, tumor cells consume too much glucose despite having working mitochondria and enough presence of oxygen. This observation is called the Warburg effect. Following this observation, Warburg and his colleagues concluded: that to kill a tumor cell, it must be deprived of glucose. ==Private life== Otto Warburg was gay, his partner was Jacob Heiss. ==References== == Other websites == * The Prime Cause and Prevention of Cancer * Excerpt from The Warburgs by Ron Chernow pgs. 539-541 * Website of the Otto Warburg Medal * Fpriz Category:1883 births Category:1970 deaths Category:German chemists Category:German Nobel Prize winners Category:LGBT Nobel Prize winners",
