 "text": "The Royal Castle in Warsaw (Polish: Zamek Królewski w Warszawie) is a palace and museum in Warsaw, Poland. It used to be the home of Polish kings. The king's offices were in the Castle from the 16th century until 1795. The Castle is in Castle Square, near the Old Town, and has a large collection of Polish and European art. It has two paintings by Rembrandt. Many important events in Poland's history happened at the Royal Castle. The Constitution of 3 May 1791, the first in Europe and the world's second-oldest national constitution, was made here. The Castle was changed to a neoclassical style after Poland was divided. From 1918 to 1939, it was the home of the Polish president. During World War II, the Castle was destroyed. In September 1939, German planes bombed it, and in 1944, the Nazis blew it up after the Warsaw Uprising failed. In 1965, the remaining parts of the Castle and nearby buildings were named historical monuments. The Castle was rebuilt from 1971 to 1984 to look like it did in the 17th century. In 1980, the Royal Castle and the Old Town became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the second most visited art museum in Poland after Wawel Castle in Kraków. In 2023, more than 2 million people visited the Royal Castle of Warsaw. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Warsaw",
