It does not get a lot of customers. This is because it sells a food called chum, which cannot be eaten. Plankton's wife, Karen, is a computer. She often appears on the wall of the back room of the Chum Bucket. The Krusty Krab is the Chum Bucket's rival across the street. The Krusty Krab sells delicious food, hamburgers called Krabby Patties. Category:SpongeBob SquarePants Category:Fictional buildings and structures",
