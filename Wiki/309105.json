 "text": "A biographical movie or biopic is a movie about a particular person or group of people, based on events that actually happened. They are like docudramas but concentrate persons rather than events. They may present events as they actually happened, or may stretch and adjust the truth for other purposes. Biographical movies often single out the most important events of the lives involved to focus on. They may also cross over between genres, such as drama, comedy and action.",
