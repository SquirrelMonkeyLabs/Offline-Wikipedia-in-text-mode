The melody of the anthem was composed by Alexei Lvov, and the lyrics were written by Vasily Zhukovsky. == History == In 1833 the emperor Nicholas I was visiting Austria and Prussia with Alexei Lvov. Nicholas was greeted by English marches, which he didn't like. When he came back to Russia, he had Alexei compose a song that would become the national anthem. The composer, Alexei Lvov and the lyricist, Vasily Zhukovsky, created the anthem that was first played in December 1833. After that, the song became the national anthem of Russian Empire, with the name of \"God save the Tsar!\". The anthem was used until the revolution in 1917. The song were succeeded by the \"Worker's Marseillaise\" and later by the \"Internationale\". == Lyrics == During Imperial Russia, mostly only the first stanza was played, easy to remember, usually repeated three times.
