 "text": "Being awake is a daily brain state. It is being in a state of consciousness where one is conscious about the surroundings. The person (or animal) can respond to these surroundings by communicating, walking, eating, and more. Being awake is the opposite of being asleep. When you are asleep most responses to your surroundings are turned off, and you are unconscious of what is happening around you. Animals are awake for some hours each day or night. Animals which are awake during the day are called diurnal. Animals which are awake during the night are called nocturnal. Diurnal animals include humans. Most wake up in the morning and are awake during the day. When they are awake they can eat and move. Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Consciousness Category:Sleep",
