 "text": "Suttungr or Saturn XXIII, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by Brett J. Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000 S 12\\. Suttungr is about 5.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,667,000 km in 1029.703 days, at an inclination of 174° to the ecliptic (151° to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.131. Suttungr may have formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe at some point in the past. It was named in August 2003 from Norse mythology, where Suttung is a Jotun or giant who once owned the mead of poetry. The name was said as Suttung in IAU Circular 8177. However, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature later decided to add the nominative case ending -r to the base form Suttung. == References == * IAUC 7548: S/2000 S 12 2000 December 23 (discovery) * MPEC 2000-Y33: S/2000 S 12 2000 December 22 (recovery/discovery and ephemeris) * IAUC 8177: Satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus 2003 August 8 (naming the moon Suttung) * IAUC 8471: Satellites of Saturn 2005 January 21 (correcting the name) Category:Saturn's moons",
