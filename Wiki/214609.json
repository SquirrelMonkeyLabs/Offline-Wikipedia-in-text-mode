The butterflies in this subfamily are only found in the Holarctic Region (the Holarctic Region is the northern part of North America and Eurasia).Bernard D'Abrera (1990). Butterflies of the Holarctic Region Part 1: Papilionidae, Pieridae, Danaidae, and Satyridae (Partim). Hill House, Victoria, Australia. The caterpillars and adults are poisonous to vertebrates. The caterpillars are thought to be Müllerian mimics with millipedes. The adult butterflies are thought to be Müllerian mimics with adult Whites.James A. Scott (1986). The Butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA. After mating, the male glues a structure to the end of the female's abdomen. This keeps the female from mating again. This structure is called a sphragis. ==Tribes and genera== *Parnassiini Duponchel, 1835 **Hypermnestra Ménétriés, 1846 **Parnassius Latreille, 1804 *Luehdorfiini Chapman, 1895 **Archon Hübner, 1819 **Luehdorfia Crüger, 1878 *Zerythiini **Sericinus Westwood, 1851 **Bhutanitis Atkinson, 1873 **Zerynthia Ochsenheimer, 1816 **Allancastria Bryk, 1934 ==Extinct species== The two species listed here are extinct.
