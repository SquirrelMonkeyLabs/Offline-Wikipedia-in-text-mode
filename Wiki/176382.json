 "text": "Fun and Fancy Free is a 1947 American animated musical fantasy comedy package movie. It was produced by Walt Disney. It was released on September 27, 1947 by RKO Radio Pictures. It is the 9th Disney animated movie and the fourth of the package movies the studio produced in the 1940s in order to save money during World War II. The Disney package movies of the late 1940s helped finance Cinderella, and subsequent others, such as Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. ==Stories== The movie features two stories. ===Bongo=== The first story, Bongo, is hosted by Jiminy Cricket and narrated by Dinah Shore. Based on the tale \"Little Bear Bongo\" by Sinclair Lewis, Bongo tells the story of a circus bear cub named Bongo who longs for freedom from captivity. Bongo escapes the circus and eventually forms a romantic relationship with a female bear cub named Lulubelle in the wild, realizing that he must prove himself in order to earn Lulubelle as his mate. ===Mickey and the Beanstalk=== The second story, Mickey and the Beanstalk, is hosted by Edgar Bergen and Sterling Holloway and is a retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk featuring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy as three pheasants who discover the temperamental Willie the Giant's castle in the sky through the use of some magic beans. They must battle the greedy but lovable giant in order to restore peace to their valley. Mickey and the Beanstalk was the last time Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse, because he was too busy on other projects to continue voicing the famous character. Disney replaced himself with sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald. == Voice cast == * Edgar Bergen – himself, Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd * Luana Patten – herself * Dinah Shore – singer, narrator of Bongo * Sterling Holloway - narrator of Mickey and the Beanstalk * Cliff Edwards – Jiminy Cricket * Walt Disney – Mickey Mouse * Clarence Nash – Donald Duck * Pinto Colvig – Goofy * Billy Gilbert – Willie the Giant * Anita Gordon – singing harp * Thurl Ravenscroft - Bull * The King's Men – Happy Valley crows == Rereleased == *October 18, 1957 *September 14, 1960 *December 15, 1967 *June 21, 1974 *May 23, 1980 *April 12, 1985 *May 15, 1992 *June 30, 1995 == Reception == Fun and Fancy Free received mostly positive reception.
