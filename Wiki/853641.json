 "text": "Arctic rabies virus is a strain of Rabies lyssavirus that circulates throughout the arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia. There have been no cases in Sweden or in the mainland of Norway in over 100 years. The virus is, however, found on Svalbard. No cases have been reported in Finland since 1989. Arctic rabies virus belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae and the genus Lyssavirus. It is one of four genotypes of rabies. All four types can adapt to different hosts, including fruit- and insect-eating bats and the Arctic fox. The Arctic fox is the Arctic rabies virus's main host.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1820997 ==References== Category:Viruses Category:Zoonoses Category:Lyssaviruses",
