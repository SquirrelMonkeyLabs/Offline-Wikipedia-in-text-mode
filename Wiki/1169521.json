 "text": "Zanella Hnos, also known as Zanella, is a Argentine motor company. The company is based in Buenos Aires. Zanella makes motorcycles, mopeds, ATVs, mini trucks, and previously go-karts. When it was founded in 1948 it used 100 cc and 125 cc engines designed by Fabio Taglioni. It is licensed by Ceccato motorcycles. The only vehicles now made in Argentina at Zanella's plants in Casero and San Luis are mopeds. Most other products are imported from China as kits. In December 2009 a official presentation at one of Zanella's plants in Casero was held by the Cámara de Fabricantes, Concesionarios y Proveedores de Motovehículos - CAFACOM (Chamber of Manufacturers, Dealers and Suppliers of Motor Vehicles). During the ceremony Marcelo Fernández chairman of the General Confederation Entrepreneur of Argentina (CGERA) stated: > As a national company, Zanella is constantly developing projects in defense > of the motorcycle industry and the interests of customers, and that is why > we are promoting the creation of the House of Moto, to get more and better > benefits for both manufacturers and traders\".The Motorcycle Chamber already > exists; strong push from Zanella == Models == === Utilities === Zmax series are three wheelers * TRICARGO 100 4T * Z MAX 200 * ZMAX 200 Z2 * Z-MAX 200 S TRUCK * Z-MAX 200 S TRUCK BOX * Z-MAX 200 TRUCK Z2 === Cubs === ZB110 Series * ZB 110 Z1 * ZB 110 Z1 FULL === Fun === * HOT 90 G2 === Street === * SAPUCAI 125 C * RX 125 potenciado * SAPUCAI 150 * RX 150 G3 * RX 150 G3 GHOST * RX 150 G3 GHOST FULL * RX 150 Z6 GHOST * RX 150 Z3 SPORT * RX 150 R FULL * RX 200 * RX 1 150 * RX 150 Z5 * RX 1 200 * RX 200 MONACO * RX 200 NAKED * RX 200 R * RX 200 R FULL * RZ 20 * RX 250 SPORT * RX 350 * RZ 25 NAKED * RZ 25 R * RZ 35 R === ON/OFF === * ZR 150 * ZR 200 * ZR 250 LT * ZR 250 * ZTT 250 MOTARD === Scooters === * STYLER 150 R16 * STYLER 50 EXCLUSIVE * STYLER 125 EXCLUSIVE G2 * STYLER 150 EXCLUSIVE * STYLER 150 CRUISER * MOD 150 * MOD LAMBRETTA 150 * E-STYLER * E-STYLER DELUXE * STYLER 250 CRUISER * STYLER 250 GRANDCRUISER === Custom === * PATAGONIAN EAGLE BLACKSTREET 150 * PATAGONIAN EAGLE BLACKMETAL 150 * PATAGONIAN EAGLE 150 * PATAGONIAN EAGLE 250 * SPEEDLIGHT 150 * SPEEDLIGHT 200 * PATAGONIAN EAGLE 250 II SHADOW * PATAGONIAN EAGLE 250 DARKROAD * PATAGONIAN EAGLE 350 CHOPPER === Quads (ATVs) === * ZANELLA KIDS 50 SPORT * FX KART 50 * FX KART 125 * FX KART 150 * FX 90 CARGO * FX 90 SERIES * FX 90 KIDS SPORT * FX 150 CARGO * FX 125 MADMAX * FX 150 MADMAX * FX 150 MADMAX AUTO. * FX 200 MADMAX * FX 250 MADMAX * FX 250 MADMAX KING * FX 300 MAD MAX * GFORCE 200 4X2 * GFORCE 250 4X2 * GFORCE 250 II 4X2 * GFORCE 500 4X4 == Electrical generators == * G-1000 * G-2500 * G-4500 * G-6000 * G-8500 == References == Category:Argentina Category:Buenos Aires Category:Motorcycles",
