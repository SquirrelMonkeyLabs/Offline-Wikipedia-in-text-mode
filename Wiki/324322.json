 "text": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)GERD is an acronym for \"_G_ astro _E_ sophageal _R_ eflux _D_ isease.\" is a chronic medical problem involving the part of the body which runs from the mouth to the stomach.GERD is also called \"_G_ astro-_O_ esophageal _R_ eflux _D_ isease (GORD) or \"gastric reflux disease\" or \"acid reflux disease\". GERD and GORD are different spelling acronyms for the same thing. The problem exists when stomach contents move backwards towards the mouth, or when thr stomach produces too many amino acids. Food or liquid moves from the stomach into the tube between the mouth and the stomach. That tube is called the oesophagus.PubMed Health, \"Gastroesophageal reflux disease ...
