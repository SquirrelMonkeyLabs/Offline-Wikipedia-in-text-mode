This company sold the land to W. J. Worthington, who was William O. Bradley's lieutenant governor from 1895 to 1899. After his death, the property was given to his daughters, who founded the present town and named it for their father. Worthington was incorporated as a city by the Kentucky General Assembly on February 5, 1920. ==References== Category:Cities in Kentucky",
