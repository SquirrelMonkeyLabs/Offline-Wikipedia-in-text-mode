 "text": "A veranda or verandah is a porch or long, open room with a roof over it. It can be an open area with a roof that is built around a building at the center. It usually has a line of columns or pillars holding up the roof. There is often a railing around the outside. Verandahs often cover the whole front and sides of a building. ==History of term== The word Veranda came to English through India by way of an Indo-Portuguese creole, the word itself comes from the Portuguese varanda which means \"long balcony or terrace\". == Verandahs in styles of architecture== The veranda has been an important part of local Australian architecture. It began to become common in colonial buildings during the 1850s. The Creole Townhouse in New Orleans, Louisiana is also noted for its prominent use of verandas. ==Related pages== *Awning *Canopy *Deck *Loggia *Patio *Terrace ==References== ==Other websites== *Verandah *Archnet discussion forum on Verandah *British Empire Architecture * Ajay Sinha Discovers Experimentation in Ancient Indian Temple Design *See more verandas in the Becoming Queensland online exhibition Category:Architectural elements",
