The incident happened in a road rage at around 10 pm during night. Consequently, Bishesh protested and served an ultimatum to Okendra to apologize for the incident within seven days or face outcomes. However, the officials of the Minister rejected her claim over the incident. According to them, Bishesh was driving “dead drunk” and was even not able to reverse her car which was blocking the minister’s security escorts. Further, the minister's officials said that Bishesh was throwing tantrums claiming she had the right to drive and even attempted to forcibly open the minister’s vehicle's door. In response, Bishesh denied all the claims from the minister's officials as \"baseless charges\". She denied she was drunk. She clarified that she was not even consuming salt and oil in her diet for her hormone therapy in a preparation for a beauty contest. Shocked by the incident, she was hospitalized. The associations and organizations of various artistes banned all mobile theatres, films and music programmes in the Heirok Assembly Constituency (Okendra's vonstituency) until and unless he apologized. == References == == Other websites == * Bishesh Huirem_IMDb Category:Meitei people Category:Indian models Category:Living people Category:Transgender women Category:Indian actors",
