In 1981 Vandegeerde was co-founder of printing house \"les ateliers graphiques\" where meetings were held by a dozen activist youths. Together with the three other CCC members, Pierre Carette, Didier Chevolet and Bertrand Sassoye, they committed about twenty politically terrorist attacks in Belgium between October 1984 and December 1985. Two firefighters died in the attack on 1 May 1985. In December 1985, the four people were caught in Namur. Several documents related to the CCC were found in her apartment. In October 1988 the court of assizes in Brussels sentenced them to life imprisonment. Vandegeerde was released early on 4 February 2000 from the prison of Namur. Vandegeerde died in December 2022, at the age of 64. ==References== Category:Terrorists Category:Communists Category:Belgian criminals Category:1957 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Place of death missing",
