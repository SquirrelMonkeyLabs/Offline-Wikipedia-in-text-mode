 "text": "TSG 1899 Hoffenheim is a football club based in Hoffenheim, a suburb of Sinsheim, Baden-Württemberg. They play in the German Bundesliga In the year 2000 they played in the 5th division but in 2008 they promoted to the Bundesliga. It was possible with the financial help of the software mogul Dietmar Hopp, who had played in the club's youth system. The financial help was widely criticized by other clubs, fans and by some in the German press. The most important points were the lack of tradition and the small fan base. Hoffenheim has only 3,300 inhabitants, and Sinsheim, where they play their home games, has only about 35,000 residents. . ==Honors== The club's honours: ===League=== * 2.
