 "text": "John Michael Hawthorn (10 April 1929 â€“ 22 January 1959) was a racing driver, born in Mexborough, Yorkshire, England, and educated at Ardingly College, West Sussex. On 22 January 1959, only three months into his retirement, Hawthorn died in a car accident on the A3 Guildford bypass. He drove his modified 1958 Jaguar 3.4-litre saloon (now known as the 3.4 Mk 1) VDU 881 to London. The precise cause of the accident is unknown. The accident occurred on a notoriously dangerous section of the road, the scene of 15 serious accidents (two fatal) in the previous two years. The road was also wet at the time. Driving at speed (one witness estimated 80 m.p.h.), Hawthorn overtook a Mercedes-Benz 300SL 'gull-wing' sports car driven by an acquaintance, the motor racing team manager Rob Walker. On entering a right-hand bend shortly after passing the Mercedes, Hawthorn clipped a 'Keep Left' bollard dividing the two carriageways, causing him to lose control.. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:1959 deaths Category:British Formula One drivers Category:Road accident deaths",
