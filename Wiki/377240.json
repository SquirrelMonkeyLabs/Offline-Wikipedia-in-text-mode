The words of Ono's citation explain: > Private First Class Frank H. Ono distinguished himself by extraordinary > heroism in action on 4 July 1944, near Castellina, Italy. In attacking a > heavily defended hill, Private First Class Ono's squad was caught in a hail > of formidable fire from the well-entrenched enemy. Private First Class Ono > opened fire with his automatic rifle and silenced one machine gun 300 > hundred yards to the right front. Advancing through incessant fire, he > killed a sniper with another burst of fire, and while his squad leader > reorganized the rest of the platoon in the rear, he alone defended the > critical position. His weapon was then wrenched from his grasp by a burst of > enemy machine pistol fire as enemy troops attempted to close in on him. > Hurling hand grenades, Private First Class Ono forced the enemy to give up > on the attempt, resolutely defending the newly won ground until the rest of > the platoon moved forward. Taking a wounded comrade's rifle, Private First > Class Ono again joined in the assault. After killing two more enemy > soldiers, he boldly ran through withering automatic, small arms, and mortar > fire to render first aid to his platoon leader and a seriously wounded > rifleman. In danger of being encircled, the platoon was ordered to withdraw. > Volunteering to cover the platoon, Private First Class Ono occupied > virtually unprotected positions near the crest of the hill, engaging an > enemy machine gun emplaced on an adjoining ridge and exchanging fire with > snipers armed with machine pistols. Completely disregarding his own safety, > he made himself the constant target of concentrated enemy fire until the > platoon reached the comparative safety of a draw. He then descended the hill > in stages, firing his rifle, until he rejoined the platoon. Private First > Class Ono's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with > the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, > his unit, and the United States Army.Gomez-Granger, Julissa.
