 "text": "Polaris Dawn was a spaceflight with astronauts in 2024. The flight was done in one of the spacecraft of SpaceX, on behalf of Jared Isaacman, the CEO of the company Shift4. It was the first of three planned missions in the Polaris program. Launched 10 September 2024 as the 14th crewed orbital flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, Isaacman and his crew of three — Scott Poteet, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon — flew in an elliptic orbit that took them 1,400 kilometers (870 mi) away from Earth, the farthest anyone has been since NASA's Apollo program. They passed through parts of the Van Allen radiation belt to study the health effects of space radiation and spaceflight on the human body. Later in the mission, the crew performed the first commercial spacewalk. Category:Private spaceflight",
