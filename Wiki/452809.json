The Giants won against the Patriots 17–14. The game was played on February 3, 2008 at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The win gave the Giants their third Super Bowl title and their first since the 1990 NFL season at Super Bowl XXV. Eli Manning was named the Super Bowl MVP. The Patriots entered Super Bowl XLII as the 12-point favorites because they completed the regular season undefeated with 16 wins and no losses. The Giants had ended the season with a record of 10–6 and were trying to become the first NFC wild card team to win a Super Bowl. Super Bowl XLII is regarded as one of the biggest upsets in sports history. The game ended with a fourth-quarter drive by the Giants to win the game. The drive featured David Tyree making a leaping one-handed catch against his helmet for a 32-yard gain and Plaxico Burress scoring the winning touchdown on a 13-yard reception with 35 seconds in the game remaining.
