He tells the story about his brother Sonny's drug problems, getting arrested, and then getting better. The story was first printed in Partisan Review. == Plot == \"Sonny's Blues\" is about two brothers, Sonny and the narrator. The story is told from the narrator's point of view. The story goes back and forth between the present and the past. The narrator is a math teacher, and he reads about Sonny's arrest for using drugs. He worries about Sonny and the boys in his class. Later, after the narrator's daughter dies, he decides to reach out to Sonny. The story then goes back to when Sonny was a teenager and became obsessed with playing the piano. Sonny drops out of school to pursue his passion. Later, Sonny joins the Navy, and when he returns, he and the narrator have a poor relationship. In the present, the narrator realises that his unavailability in Sonny's life may have slowed Sonny's growth and decides to reconnect with him. In the story, the narrator thinks about searching Sonny's room while his wife Isabel takes their kids to see their grandparents. However, he changes his mind when he sees Sonny performing in a revival meeting on the street below. Later on, Sonny invites the narrator to watch him play in Greenwich Village. The narrator agrees and asks Sonny about his heroin addiction. Sonny explains that using drugs made him feel in control, but he wanted to escape from that life. At the jazz club, Sonny's playing is initially shaky, but he eventually wins over the crowd, including the narrator.
