The company's history can be traced back to 2004 when it was established as a joint venture between TCL Corporation and Alcatel-Lucent. TCL Corporation, a Chinese multinational electronics company, entered into a licensing agreement with Alcatel-Lucent to use the Alcatel brand for its mobile phones. This joint venture allowed TCL Corporation to tap into Alcatel-Lucent's expertise in telecommunications while leveraging its own manufacturing capabilities. Alcatel's headquarters is located in Huizhou, Guangdong Province, China. From there, the company operates its research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities. The headquarters serves as the main hub for Alcatel's global operations. Alcatel primarily offers mobile phones and smartphones to consumers worldwide.
