 "text": "Mallorca Son Moix Stadium is a football stadium in Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, and serves as the home ground of RCD Mallorca. It is the largest stadium in the Balearic Islands and the 26th largest in Spain. Since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic it was known as 'Visit Mallorca Stadium' having been re-named in a partnership with Consell de Mallorca to help resume the tourist activities on the island -its main resource. ==International games== The Spain national football team has played three international matches at the stadium; the most recent one was on 8 June 2024 against Northern Ireland in a friendly match, with Spain winning 5â€“1. ==Future== Any future improvement plans seem to be on hold, with RCD Mallorca preferring to explore the construction of a new stadium. This is in part to the club and their landlords being in disagreement over improvements to the existing stadium. == References == ==Other websites== *Estadios de Espana Category:RCD Mallorca Category:Football venues in the Balearic Islands Category:Sports venues completed in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Spain Category:Buildings and structures in Palma de Mallorca Category:Defunct athletics (track and field) venues in Spain",
