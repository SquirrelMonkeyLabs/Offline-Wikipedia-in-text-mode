The oldest finding in the city area is dated around 4500 B.C. From 15 B.C. onwards after the Roman occupation the city was called Iuvavum. The roman city was in today's old town around the Waagplatz. The city became an important place from the east to the province of Germania. The Romans left on the beginning of the barbarian migration around 500. Up to 696 only little can be said about the history. In 696 the city was given to bishop Rupert by Duke Theodo II. of Bavaria. Rupert was ordered by the Duke to bring Christianity to the east and southeast of his country. Rupert founded the monastery St. Peter and for women the monastery Nonnberg. 739 Salzburg became the seat of a bishop and 774 the first cathedral was built. 998 Salzburg became archbishopric ruling the whole Bavarian area. In the Middle Ages Salzburg became wealthy by the trade with salt from the nearby Dürnberg in Hallein. Till the 14th century Salzburg became independent from Bavaria and was a state within the Holy Roman Empire. The citizens of Salzburg were under the command of the archbishop unlike other cities in the empire. In the baroque era the look of today's city was shaped. The cathedral was rebuilt in the baroque style. Most of the architects came from Italy. 1622 a university was founded. Due to the fact that it was a catholic state Protestants had a severe standing in Salzburg. Yet 1731 Protestants, who came not back to the catholic belief had do leave Salzburg within eight days. In the early 19th century Napoleon Bonaparte promoted the Duchy of Salzburg, than later was a part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Then, Salzburg was annexed by Austria, returned to Bavarian and divided between Bavaria and Austria. 1918 Salzburg became a federal state of the new Republic of Austria. In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and Salzburg was a part of Germany. In 1945, when Austria was independent from Germany. It became a federal state again. ==Urban districts== Urban districts (Stadtteile): * Aigen * Altstadt * Elisabeth- Vorstadt * Gneis * Gneis-Süd * Gnigl * Itzling * Itzling-Nord * Kasern * Langwied * Lehen * Leopoldskron-Moos * Liefering * Maxglan * Maxglan-West * Morzg * Mülln * Neustadt * Nonntal * Parsch * Riedenburg * Salzburg-Süd * Taxham * Schallmoos ==Mayors of the city since it became part of Austria== ===1816 - 1875=== *Magistrat without mayor 1816 bis 1818 *Anton von Heffter 1818 - 1831 *Alois Lergetporer 1831 - 1847 *Mathias Gschnitzer 1847 - 1850 *Franz Xaver Späth 1850 - 1853 *Alois Spängler 1854 - 1861 *Heinrich Ritter von Mertens 1861 - 1872 *Ignaz Harrer 1872 - 1875 ===1875 - 1919=== *Rudolf Biebl 1875 - 1885 *Leopold Scheibl 1885 - 1888 *Albert Schumacher 1888 - 1890 *Franz von Hueber 1890 - 1894 *Gustav Zeller 1894 - 1898 *Eligius Scheibl 1898 - 1900 *Franz Berger 1900 - 1912 *Max Ott 1912 - 1919 ===1919 bis 1945 === *Josef Preis 1919 - 1927 *Max Ott 1927 - 1935 *Richard Hildmann 1935 - 1938 *Anton Giger, 1938 - 1945 - „Oberbürgermeister der Gauhauptstadt Salzburg“ during Nazi occupation ===1945 bis 1999 === *Richard Hildmann 1945 - 1946 *Anton Neumayr 1946 - 1951 *Stanislaus Pacher 1952 - 1957 *Alfred Bäck 1957 - 1970 *Heinrich Salfenauer 1970 - 1980 *Josef Reschen 1980 - 1990 *Harald Lettner 1990 - 1992 *Josef Dechant 1992 - 1999 === Mayor elected directly by the people from 1999 onwards=== * Heinz Schaden since 1999 == Monuments == Salzburg is a World Heritage.
