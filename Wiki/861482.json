 "text": "The rusty tree frog, zebra frog, duck-footed frog, giant tree frog, or giant gladiator tree frog (Boana boans) is a frog that lives in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and Trinidad. The adult male frog is 101 to 128 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 91 to 123 mm long. The skin on the male frog's back is brown and the skin on the female frog's back is orange-brown. Both male and female frogs have dark bars on their bodies. Both male and female frogs have bellies that are almost white. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It lays eggs during the time of year when there is less rain. The male digs a hole that fills with water. This hole is called a nest basin. The male frogs usually build nest basins near streams so the water will get in. Male frogs fight each other for the best places to dig. The female frog leaves 1300 to 3000 eggs on the surface of the water in the nest basin. The tadpoles are light brown or almost white. Fish do not like to eat these tadpoles. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
