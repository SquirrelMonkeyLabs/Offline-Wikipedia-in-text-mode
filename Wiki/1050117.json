 "text": "The 2012 UEFA Champions League final was the last football match in Germany. Bayern Munich played against Chelsea. They played at the Allianz Arena in Munich to see who would win the 2011–12 season of the Champions League. Bayern had been in the final nine times before, winning four and losing four most recently losing in 2010. Chelsea had been in the final once before in 2008, but they didn't win. This match was special because it was the first time the Champions League final was played at the Allianz Arena, which is Bayern's home stadium (known as Fußball Arena München for the final). Both teams did really well to get to the final, beating other teams along the way. The match was exciting. Bayern scored first, but Chelsea tied the game later on. They played extra time, and even though Bayern had a chance to score with a penalty, they missed. So, they had to do a penalty shootout. Chelsea won the shootout 4–3 and became the Champions League winners for the first time. This was big because they were the first London club to win it and the fifth English club overall. Because they won, Chelsea got to play in the UEFA Super Cup but lost to Atlético Madrid. They also got to play in the next season's Champions League, even though they didn't do well in their own league. They represented Europe at the FIFA Club World Cup but lost to Corinthians in the final. == How the teams got here == Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).
