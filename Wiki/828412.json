 "text": "\"The Bonfire of the Manatees\" is the first episode of The Simpsons 17th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on September 11, 2005. The episode was written by Dan Greaney. Mark Kirkland is the director of the episode. In the episode, Homer Simpson gets in debt with Fat Tony and must let some people make a pornographic movie in his house. Marge and a marine biologist try to keep manatees safe from jet skis. Alec Baldwin is a guest star as Dr. Thorn (the marine biologist). The episode's story was one of the ideas for the story of The Simpsons Movie. Al Jean wanted the movie to be about the Simpson family saving manatees. The idea was made into this episode instead. About 11.1 milion people watched the episode when it was first broadcast. The episode shows the Denver Broncos winning the Super Bowl over the Seattle Seahawks. The teams later played at Super Bowl XLVIII, but the Seahawks won the real game. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:The Simpsons (season 17) episodes Category:2005 television episodes",
