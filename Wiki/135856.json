It was designed by Tony Couch of Sydney, Australia. == Symbol of the Island== The blue field means the sea that surrounds the island while the green field means the plants of the island. The southern cross appears in the blue field, showing Christmas Island's connection with Australia as well as its location in the southern hemisphere. The bird is a Golden Bosun, native to the island. The yellow disc means the island's history in mining. There is a map of the island in the centre of the disc. == History of the Flag == === Creation === In 1986, the Christmas Island Assembly held a competition for people to create a flag and coat of arms for Christmas Island.
