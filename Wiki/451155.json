 "text": "The Ionic order is one of the three main classical orders (styles) of ancient Greek and Roman architecture. The other two are the Doric order and the Corinthian order (which gave rise to the Composite order). The Ionic capital is notable for its use of volutes. The Ionic columns normally stand on a base which separates the shaft of the column from the stylobate or platform. The cap is usually enriched with egg-and-dart.James Stevens Curl, Classical Architecture: An Introduction to Its Vocabulary and Essentials, with a Select Glossary of Terms (New York: Norton, 2003), p. 24 It was a popular style in Athens.Fred Kleiner, Gardner's Art through the Ages: Backpack Edition, Book 1 (Boston: Wadsworth, 2013), p. 116 The Athenians considered themselves Ionians. == References == Category:Architectural styles",
