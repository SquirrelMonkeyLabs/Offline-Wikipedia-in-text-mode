 "text": "The 1995–96 NHL season was the 79th regular season of the National Hockey League. Twenty-six teams each played 82 games. The Stanley Cup winners were the Colorado Avalanche. They swept the Florida Panthers in four games. This was the first year the team was named Avalanche. ==League Business== 1995–96 was the first season in Denver for the Avalanche, who had relocated from Quebec City where they were previously known as the Quebec Nordiques. It was also the last season of existence for the Winnipeg Jets, as they announced that they would be moving from Manitoba to Arizona and become the Phoenix Coyotes at the season's end. 1995–96 would mark the last season the Buffalo Sabres would play in the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, the Flyers at the Spectrum, and Canadiens at the Montreal Forum. ==Regular season== The Detroit Red Wings had a great season, finishing with the second-highest regular-season point total in NHL history (131 points), yet they fell to the Avalanche in the Western Conference final, the sixth game of which marked the beginning of the heated Detroit-Colorado rivalry. ===Final standings=== Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF= Goals For, GA = Goals Against, Pts = Points Eastern Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Team W L T GF GA Pts Pittsburgh Penguins 49 29 4 362 284 102 Boston Bruins 40 31 11 282 269 91 Montreal Canadiens 40 32 10 265 248 90 Hartford Whalers 34 39 9 237 259 77 Buffalo Sabres 33 42 7 247 262 73 Ottawa Senators 18 59 5 191 291 41 Western Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Team W L T GF GA Pts Detroit Red Wings 62 13 7 325 181 131 Chicago Blackhawks 40 28 14 273 220 94 Toronto Maple Leafs 34 36 12 247 252 80 St. Louis Blues 32 34 16 219 248 80 Winnipeg Jets 36 40 6 275 291 78 Dallas Stars 26 42 14 227 280 66 ===Scoring leaders=== Note: GP = Games Played, G = Goals, A = Assists, Pts = Points Player Team GP G A PTS Mario Lemieux Pittsburgh 70 69 92 161 Jaromir Jagr Pittsburgh 82 62 87 149 Joe Sakic Colorado 82 51 69 120 Ron Francis Pittsburgh 77 27 92 119 Peter Forsberg Colorado 82 30 86 116 Eric Lindros Philadelphia 73 47 68 115 Paul Kariya Anaheim 82 50 58 108 Teemu Selanne Winnipeg/ Anaheim 79 40 68 108 Sergei Fedorov Detroit 78 39 68 107 Alexander Mogilny Vancouver 79 55 52 107 ==Stanley Cup playoffs== ===Playoff bracket=== ===Conference quarterfinals=== ====Eastern Conference==== {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Philadelphia vs. Tampa Bay Date Away Home April 16 Tampa Bay 3 7 Philadelphia April 18 Tampa Bay 2 1 Philadelphia OT April 21 Philadelphia 4 5 Tampa Bay OT April 23 Philadelphia 4 1 Tampa Bay April 25 Tampa Bay 1 4 Philadelphia April 27 Philadelphia 6 1 Tampa Bay Philadelphia wins series 4–2 ====Western Conference==== {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Detroit vs. Winnipeg Date Away Home April 17 Winnipeg 1 4 Detroit April 19 Winnipeg 0 4 Detroit April 21 Detroit 1 4 Winnipeg April 23 Detroit 6 1 Winnipeg April 26 Winnipeg 3 1 Detroit April 28 Detroit 4 1 Winnipeg Detroit wins series 4–2 ===Conference semifinals=== Eastern Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Florida vs. Philadelphia Date Away Home May 2 Florida 2 0 Philadelphia May 4 Florida 2 3 Philadelphia May 7 Philadelphia 3 1 Florida May 9 Philadelphia 3 4 Florida OT May 12 Florida 2 1 Philadelphia 2OT May 14 Philadelphia 1 4 Florida Florida win series 4–2 Western Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" St. Louis vs. Detroit Date Away Home May 3 St. Louis 2 3 Detroit May 5 St. Louis 3 8 Detroit May 8 Detroit 4 5 St. Louis OT May 10 Detroit 0 1 St. Louis May 12 St. Louis 3 2 Detroit May 14 Detroit 4 2 St. Louis May 16 St. Louis 0 1 Detroit 2OT Detroit wins series 4–3 ===Conference finals=== {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Florida vs. Pittsburgh Date Away Home May 18 Florida 5 1 Pittsburgh May 20 Florida 2 3 Pittsburgh May 24 Pittsburgh 2 5 Florida May 26 Pittsburgh 2 1 Florida May 28 Florida 0 3 Pittsburgh May 30 Pittsburgh 3 4 Florida June 1 Florida 3 1 Pittsburgh Florida wins series 4–3 and Prince of Wales Trophy ===Finals=== Colorado vs. Florida Date Away Score Home Score Notes June 4 Florida 1 Colorado 3 June 6 Florida 1 Colorado 8 June 8 Colorado 3 Florida 2 June 10 Colorado 1 Florida 0 3OT Colorado wins series 4–0 and Stanley Cup Joe Sakic (Colorado) wins Conn Smythe Trophy ===Scoring leaders=== Note: GP = Games Played, G = Goals, A = Assists, Pts = Points Player Team GP G A Pts Joe Sakic Colorado 22 18 16 34 Mario Lemieux Pittsburgh 18 11 16 27 Jaromir Jagr Pittsburgh 18 11 12 23 Valeri Kamensky Colorado 22 10 12 22 Peter Forsberg Colorado 22 10 11 21 Petr Nedved Pittsburgh 18 10 10 20 Steve Yzerman Detroit 18 8 12 20 Sergei Fedorov Detroit 19 2 18 20 Sandis Ozolinsh Colorado 22 5 14 19 Dave Lowry Florida 22 10 7 17 Mike Ricci Colorado 22 6 11 17 Adam Deadmarsh Colorado 22 5 12 17 ==NHL Awards== Presidents' Trophy: Detroit Red Wings Prince of Wales Trophy: Florida Panthers Clarence S.
