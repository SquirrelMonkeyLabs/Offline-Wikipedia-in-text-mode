 "text": "The 1924 Soviet Constitution was the first of three constitutions the Soviet Union had and replaced the 1918 Russian Constitution. The 1924 Constitution paved the way for later Soviet policies like the five-year plans. According to Archie Brown, none of the Soviet Constitutions were accurate guides to the political reality in the USSR. This constitution was later replaced by the 1936 Soviet Constitution and then the 1977 Soviet Constitution.
