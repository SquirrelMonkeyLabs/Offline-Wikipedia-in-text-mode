The Kansas government needed to decide where to build the university. Their choices were Manhattan, Emporia, or Lawrence. On January 13, 1863, Kansas State University was built in Manhattan. The only cities left were Emporia and Lawrence. Amos A. Lawrence gave $10,000 and more than 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land for a university in Lawrence. The Kansas government liked that, so the government chose Lawrence. On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law was made if Lawrence gave a gift of a $15,000 endowment fund and a place for the university. The place would need to be in or near the town, of no less than forty acres (16 ha) of land. On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney said Lawrence had met the conditions to get the state university. In 1864, the university was officially organized. The university opened for classes on September 12, 1866, and the first class graduated in 1873. ==Academics== ===School of Business=== The University of Kansas School of Business is a public business school on the main campus in Lawrence.
