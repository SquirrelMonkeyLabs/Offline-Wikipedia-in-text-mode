It is a powerful reducing agent. It reacts with strong acids to make hydrogen telluride. It reacts with water to make sodium hydrogen telluride, NaHTe. == Preparation == Sodium telluride is made by reacting tellurium and sodium in liquid ammonia. == Uses == Sodium telluride is used to make organic tellurium compounds. It also can act as a reducing agent. == Related pages == *Sodium tellurite *Tellurous acid Category:Tellurium compounds Category:Sodium compounds",
