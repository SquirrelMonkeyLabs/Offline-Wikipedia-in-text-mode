Shirts can mean T-shirts, polo shirts, etc. In earlier times shirts, which were for men, had a collar, sleeves with cuffs and split in half with buttons on one side. This can be called a \"dress shirt\", a specific type of \"collared shirt\"). Some shirts have sleeves, that cover the arms. T-shirts are a type of shirt that has shorter sleeves. These sleeves cover the shoulders. Shirts that do not have sleeves are called \"sleeveless\". == References == Category:Tops (clothing)",
