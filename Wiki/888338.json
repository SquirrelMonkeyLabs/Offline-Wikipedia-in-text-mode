The composition resembles a stage setting, employing a multi-layered depth arrangement. At the center is an abstract structure in gray, with the title evoking a connection to it. This non-figurative gray form originates from the projection of a regular geometric shape, from which emerges a spectrum of colors, transitioning from white to anthracite gray. The construction and the represented objects intertwine with the artist's exploration, as the artist perceives the canvas as a mirror of the inner world, a place where the soul meets that of the viewer. == Related pages == * Salvatore Garau * Prospettiva di Lago (Garau) ==References== ==Other websites== * * Salvatore Garau, Università Antartica, 2003, RAAM Museo del Novecento di Milano, cm 180x200 Category:2000s paintings Category:Paintings in Milan",
