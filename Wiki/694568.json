 "text": "Designated School Official (DSO) is an official U.S. term for anyone who officially represents an American college or university in matters dealing with F-1 (visa category for foreign students to enter the United States) affairs. A school appoints its DSO, but it must also be approved by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), which is a federal government body. The duties of the DSO include signing immigration documents for foreign students. The DSO also supports and advises foreign students. ==References== ==Other websites== *https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/SEVP_DSO_Training.pdf *https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2013/10/online-training-for-designated- school-officials Category:Immigration to the United States Category:Education in the United States",
