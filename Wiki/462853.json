 "text": "Cruis'n USA is an arcade racing video game. It was released and shared by Nintendo, and created by Midway Games. It is the first game in the Cruis'n series. The arcade game was released in North America on November 1994. It was further released as a video game on the Nintendo 64 on 3 December 1996 for North America and on 12 April 1998 for Europe. It was re-released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console service on 28 March 2008 in Europe and on 31 March 2008 in North America. The Virtual Console release was the first third party developed Nintendo 64 game to be released on the service. == Issues == The game, along with Killer Instinct, was to be planned as a launch game for the Nintendo 64. Both of these games did not make it out for Nintendo 64's launch, due to the technology of the arcade games they were made on having more power than the Nintendo 64. The game was very good in the arcade, but was not good when it came to the Nintendo 64. This was due to the game being less properly made for the system. The game took longer to be released too, due to issues with what was shown. ==Reviews== IGN rated the game a 4 out of 10 with the words: \"Ignoring the dated gameplay and less than impressive physics and handling, at least graphical problems like pop-up and low frame-rates should have been fixed.\" GameSpot gave the game a 6.1 out of 10, with the words: \"Ultimately, Cruis'n USA is a dead conversion of a dead arcade game.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1994 video games Category:Midway video games Category:Arcade games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Nintendo video games Category:Racing video games",
