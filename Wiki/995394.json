The adult frog is 21.6 to 31.4 mm long from nose to rear end. Its voice sounds like a \"low, short creak.\" There is only a little webbed skin on its feet. The frog is yellow-brown in color with dark brown or black marks. There are two yellow-white lines from its nose to its back legs. The backs of the legs are red-brown in color. Other parts of the legs are almost purple. The belly is almost white. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
