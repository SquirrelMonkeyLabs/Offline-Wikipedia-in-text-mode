He is a loan manager for the first five series. Jeremy is unemployed, irresponsible, dishonest, lazy, promiscuous bisexual and hedonistic. From series 1 - 7 he attempts to become a professional musician. In series 8 and 9 he is a life coach. == Other websites == * Category:2003 British television series debuts Category:2015 British television series endings Category:2000s British sitcoms Category:2000s LGBT television series Category:2010s British sitcoms Category:2010s LGBT television series Category:BAFTA Award winning programmes Category:Black comedy television series Category:British LGBT television programmes Category:Channel 4 comedy Category:LGBT comedy television series Category:London Borough of Croydon Category:Television series about friendship Category:Television series set in London Category:English-language television programs",
