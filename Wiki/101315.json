 "text": "Gary Lineker (born 30 November 1960) is an English retired footballer. He has played for the English national team. He scored 48 goals for the English national team. He then went on television on the BBC on Match of the Day. He was the highest paid presenter at the BBC. In 2020 he was paid £1.75 million. In March 2023 he tweeted about the proposed Illegal Migration Bill: \"This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s, and I'm out of order?\". The BBC wanted him to apologise for making a political comment, but he wouldnt. They then took him off Match of the Day. The other people from the show all supported him. So did many other sport presenters. In May 2025, he was heavily criticised and forced to apologise after reposting an anti-Zionist message on social media which itself invoked 1930s Germany. == Club career statisics == |- |1978–79||rowspan=\"7\"|Leicester City||rowspan=\"2\"|Second Division||7||1||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||7||1 |- |1979–80||19||3||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||20||3 |- |1980–81||First Division||9||2||1||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||10||3 |- |1981–82||rowspan=\"2\"|Second Division||39||17||5||2||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||47||19 |- |1982–83||40||26||1||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||43||26 |- |1983–84||rowspan=\"2\"|First Division||39||22||1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||41||22 |- |1984–85||41||24||4||3||3||2||colspan=\"2\"|-||48||29 |- |1985–86||Everton||First Division||41||30||6||5||5||3||colspan=\"2\"|-||52||38 |- |1986–87||rowspan=\"3\"|Barcelona||rowspan=\"3\"|La Liga||41||21||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|-||8||0||50||22 |- |1987–88||36||16||5||2||colspan=\"2\"|-||9||2||50||20 |- |1988–89||26||6||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|-||8||4||38||11 |- |1989–90||rowspan=\"3\"|Tottenham Hotspur||rowspan=\"3\"|First Division||38||24||1||0||6||2||colspan=\"2\"|-||45||26 |- |1990–91||32||15||6||3||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|-||43||19 |- |1991–92||35||28||2||0||5||5||8||2||50||35 |- |1993||rowspan=\"2\"|Nagoya Grampus Eight||rowspan=\"2\"|J.
