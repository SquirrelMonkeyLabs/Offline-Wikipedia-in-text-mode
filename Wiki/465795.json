In 1871 it moved to Battersea. Its name was changed because of this. In 1885, Queen Victoria became Patron of the home. The television show For the Love of Dogs is mostly filmed at Battersea. There are Battersea centres in Old Windsor, Berkshire and Brands Hatch, Kent as well as in Battersea. == Mission == The home has a goal to never turn away a dog or cat in need of help. It reunites lost dogs and cats with their owners. When they can not do this, the home cares for them until a new home can be found for them. It also aims to educate the public about responsible pet ownership. == Other websites == * Official Website * Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, Registered Charity no. 206394 at the Charity Commission * Independent â€“ The curious incident of the hungry dog in the night-time Category:1860 establishments in England Category:Battersea Category:Charities of the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Wandsworth",
