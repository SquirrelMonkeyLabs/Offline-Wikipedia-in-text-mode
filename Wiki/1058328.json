 "text": "The WAGR Esl class were express steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR). The Esl resulted from fitting the Es class with larger 19-inch diameter cylinders. The 'l' suffix stands for 'large', with 's' meaning 'superheated', hence E class superheated large- cylinders or Esl. By the early 1940s, the Esl designation was folded into the Es designation like the Eso classification, though they continued with Esl modifications. None survived into preservation.
