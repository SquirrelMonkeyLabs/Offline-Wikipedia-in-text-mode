 "text": "Inception is a 2010 British-American science fiction action heist movie. Christopher Nolan wrote and directed it. He also produced the movie with his wife, Emma Thomas. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who steals information by going into the subconscious of his targets. A man tells him he will erase his criminal history if he puts an idea into someone's subconscious. The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. Nolan had the idea for Inception over nine years before it was released. But, there is also an anime film just like it called Paprika. After making Insomnia, Nolan wrote an 80-page story for a horror movie about \"dream-stealers\". He presented the idea to Warner Bros. based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation. He decided he needed more experience before making a movie this complex. Nolan stopped working on it, and worked on Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008). He spent six months working on the script for Inception before Warner Bros. bought it in February 2009. They filmed the movie in six countries. They started in Tokyo on June 19, and ended in Canada on November 22. The movie cost $160 million to make. Warner Bros. and Legendary paid for it. The movie studios spent over $100 million to advertise Inception because The Dark Knight (another movie Nolan made) was very popular. Inception was first screened in London on July 8, 2010. It was shown in standard and IMAX theatres on July 16, 2010. Inception grossed over $828 million worldwide. It became the fourth- highest-grossing movie of 2010. Many people think it is one of the best movies of the 2010s. Movie critics praised Inception for its screenplay, direction, themes, action sequences, visual effects, musical score, and ensemble cast. It won four Academy Awards (Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects) and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score. ==References== Category:2010 action movies Category:2010 crime movies Category:2010 science fiction movies Category:American action movies Category:American crime movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:British action movies Category:British crime movies Category:British science fiction movies Category:Warner Bros. movies Category:IMAX movies Category:Movies composed by Hans Zimmer Category:Movies directed by Christopher Nolan Category:Movies about dreams Category:Movies set in California",
