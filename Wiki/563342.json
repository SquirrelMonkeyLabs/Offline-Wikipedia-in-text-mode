The delta is also known as the Brahmaputra Delta, the Sunderbans Delta, or the Bengal Delta. Because it is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, it is called The Green Delta. The Ganges Delta empties into the Bay of Bengal. It is approximately across at the Bay of Bengal.. The floodplain is from three rivers: Ganges, the Brahmaputra River and the Meghna River. The delta stretches from the Hooghly River on the west to the Meghna River on the east. In India Kolkata and Haldia are the main seaports.
