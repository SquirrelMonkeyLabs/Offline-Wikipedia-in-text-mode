 "text": "Drug tolerance (or physiological tolerance) is a term used to describe that the organism gets used to a given substance. Drug tolerance also means that over time a drug becomes less effective and larger amounts of the substance are needed to get the same effect. Physiological tolerance can be achieved in one of the following ways: # By changing the number of receptors for a substance # By changing the way the signal is handled # By changing the receptors themselves # By changing the system that antagonizes the receptor == References == Category:Drugs",
