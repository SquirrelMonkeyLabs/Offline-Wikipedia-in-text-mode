 "text": "Princess Peach Toadstool (sometimes called Peach) is a character in the Mario video game series. Peach is the main female character of the games. In most of the games she appears in, she is kidnapped by the reptile monster King Bowser and his son, Bowser Jr. She is the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom, which is the main setting of most of the Mario games. Peach is Mario's love interest. She is best friends with Princess Daisy. == Appearance == Princess Peach's looks are different than what they used to be. In her first game, Super Mario Bros. (1985), she had red hair and her dress was white. She had dark red hair in Super Mario Bros. 2 (1986). In Super Mario World (1991), her looks changed. She now had yellow hair and a pink dress. In the Mario sport series games, she wears different dresses because she cannot play well in her normal, long, pink dress. In the Super Smash Bros. games, Peach wears pink shorts/bloomers. Her name has changed over the years. In Japan, her name was always Peach. When Nintendo sold Super Mario Bros. in other countries, she was called Princess Toadstool. In Super Mario 64, her name became Princess Peach Toadstool. Peach appears most often as the damsel-in-distress – always being kidnapped by Bowser. Mario must always rescue her. In Super Princess Peach (2006), the tables are turned and Bowser kidnaps Mario instead. Peach must then rescue Mario. As depicted in the game, Peach uses a parasol named Perry to defeat enemies. In the Super Smash Bros. games, Peach is one of the fighters. In the game series, Peach uses her butt against the opponents. This attack is called Peach Bomber. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Peach's Peach Bomber was accompanied with fire. In the later Super Smash Bros. games, it was accompanied with hearts. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Peach is accompanied with Daisy, who is an echo fighter. Peach has been voiced by three different actresses. The first was Leslie Swan. The second was Jen Taylor. The third was Samantha Kelly. == Playable appearances == * Super Mario Bros. 2—1988 * Mario Teaches Typing—1992 * Super Mario Kart—1992 * Super Mario All-Stars—1993 * Mario's Early Years: Fun with Letters—1994 * Mario's Early Years: Fun with Numbers—1994 * Mario's Early Years: Pre-School—1994 * Mario's Tennis—1995 * Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars—1996 * Mario Kart 64—1996 * Mario Teaches Typing 2—1997 * Mario Party—1998 * Mario Golf—1999 * Mario Party 2—1999 * Mario Tennis—2000 * Paper Mario—2000 * Mario Party 3—2000 * Super Mario Advance—2001 * Mario Kart Super Circuit—2001 * Super Smash Bros.
