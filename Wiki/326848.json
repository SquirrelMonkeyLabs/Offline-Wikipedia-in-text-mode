He is her social inferior. He proposes and she says yes. Her children and friends disapprove. Because of this, Cary ends the relationship with Ron. Cary returns to her lonely life. She sees other women getting engaged and living lives of happiness. She finds the courage to defy social norms and commits to loving Ron. == Criticism == Bosley Crowther did not like the movie. He wrote, \"The script was obviously written to bring [Wyman] and Mr. Hudson, who made a popular twosome in the Magnificent Obsession, together again. Solid and sensible drama plainly had to give way to outright emotional bulldozing and a paving of easy clich√©s.\"New York Times Review == References == Category:American romantic drama movies Category:1950s English-language movies Category:1955 romantic drama movies Category:Universal Pictures movies Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:Movies directed by Douglas Sirk Category:Women's movies",
