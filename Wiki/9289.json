The main languages are Spanish and Quechua, but there are other languages too. == History == Bolivia used to be a colony of Spain. The silver mines in Bolivia made most of Spain's money, and Spain used the native Bolivians as slaves to work in the mines. After many wars, Simón Bolívar helped Bolivia to gain its independence in 1825. After this, the country experienced a very divisive 19th century, both politically and racially. There were strong political differences amongst liberals and conservatives in Bolivia following their independence. Additionally, creoles in the country dominated Bolivian society until late in the 19th century, when Indians and other indigenous communities started to uprise. A notable figure in these indigenous uprisings was Pablo Zárate Willka. Bolivia used to own some of the Pacific coast, but it lost it in 1879 in the War of the Pacific. == Geography == Bolivia is 424,135 mi² (1,098,581 km²).

It is surrounded on all sides by other countries. The west of Bolivia is on the Andes mountain range. The highest mountain in Bolivia, located near the city of Oruro, is called Nevado de Sajama. Although the west is very high-altitude with lots of mountains, there are also parts of Bolivia which are very flat and/or very near sea level. There is also a bit of Bolivia covered by the Amazon rainforest, and the highest lake in the world: Lake Titicaca. The major cities are La Paz, El Alto, Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Cochabamba.
