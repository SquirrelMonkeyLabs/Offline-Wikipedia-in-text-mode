 "text": "Toucans are a South American bird in the family Ramphastidae. This bird lives in small flocks in lowland rainforests in countries such as Costa Rica. It flies short distances between trees. Toucans rest in holes in trees. They mostly eat fruit, but sometimes they also eat insects and small lizards. They are brightly marked and have large, often-colorful bills. The family includes five genera and over forty different species. Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists think is to find out who is the top bird amongst them.Short L.L. & Horne J.F.M. 2017. Toucans (Ramphastidae). In: del Hoyo J. et al (eds) Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive. Lynx Editions, Barcelona. == Beak == Toucans are known for their huge beaks, which can grow larger than their bodies. The beak may also be used to cool the bird off. They use their beaks for reaching over and plucking fruit from branches of trees. The bright colors (usually orange) on the beak may help the toucans to recognize each other, and to scare off other birds. The structure of their beaks consists of a keratin exterior and a bony foam interior. The beak is loaded in bending and foraging and fencing activities, although it has a low compressive strength. == Diet == The diet of toucans consists mainly of fruit, they are frugivorous. Although they sometimes consume small animals such as small birds, insects, and lizards. They also eat eggs from nests, and nestlings.https://academic.oup.com/condor/article- abstract/95/1/178/5189575?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login;=true == References == Category:Piciformes Category:Birds of South America Category:Birds of Central America",
