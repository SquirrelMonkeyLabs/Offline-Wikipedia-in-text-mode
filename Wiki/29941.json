In the Ramayana, Ravana is described as a symbol of evil, though a learned scholar well versed in the Vedas. He appears as the primary antagonist, and is said to be the most revered devotee of Shiva, with his image being associated with him at some places. He also appears in several Buddhist and Jain texts. == Pedigree == * Grandfather(maternal) - King Sumaali * Mother - Princess Kaykasee * Grandfather(paternal) - Saint of Pulasthi * Father - Saint of Waishrawa * Wife - Princess Mandhodharee * Son - Meganaadha (Indrajith) * Brothers - Kuweara, Kumbhakarna, Vibheeshana * Sister - Suparnakaa * Father in law - Saint of Kaalaneam == Kindom == Capitol - Lankapura Alakamandhaawa, Thapo wanaya, Gokannaka == Written Books == * Arka prakaasha * Kumaara thanthraya * Rasarathnaakaraya * Watikaa Prakaranaya == References == # http://www.hindustantimes.com/Ravana-is-a-hero-for-Sinhala- nationalists/Article1-249335.aspx # https://wiralfeed.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/facts-about-ravana/ ==Notes== Category:Hindu mythology Category:History of Sri Lanka",
