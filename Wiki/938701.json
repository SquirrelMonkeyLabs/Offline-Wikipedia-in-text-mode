Dorsey was related to Luther Rosser, who was Frank's defense attorney. The main prosecution witness against Frank was James Conley. Conley was a janitor. He said that Frank asked him to help cover up the murder. Frank and his defense attorneys said that Conley was the real murderer. Before that there had been other suspects in the murder, including James Gantt, a former employee fired by Frank for theft,Atlanta Journal. April 28, 1913. J. M.
