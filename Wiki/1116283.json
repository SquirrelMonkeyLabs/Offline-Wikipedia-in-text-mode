 "text": "The Bapaiya, or Bapaiyya was a legendary Koli dacoit of Gujarat who killed the Bahucharaji mata at Shankhalpur during her return to Kathiawar. When Bahuchara and her two sisters were returning from Marwad to Gujarat, they were attacked by Bapaiya plunderer at Shankhalpur. He killed two of the sisters of Bahuchara. To save herself from being raped and abduction, Bahuchara cut off ber breasts, with a sword carried by Charan women, and pronounced the dread Traga on the Bapaiya, cursing him and prophesying that he would become impotent. Bapaiya begged forgiveness, and the dying Charan girl Bahuchara realizing that the Traga having been called forth could not be recalled, advised Bapaiya to install her as a goddess and worship her image. Bahuchara also promised that any eunuch who would stay at her shrine dressed as a woman and worship her would attain salvation. After death of Bahuchara, Bapaiya, who was feeling guilty, erected a shrine of the goddess Bahuchara under a varakhda tree and passed his life in worship of the Bahuchara, but died on the way to Arnej and Balal. == References == Category:Hindu gods and goddesses Category:Koli people Category:People from Gujarat Category:Murderers",
