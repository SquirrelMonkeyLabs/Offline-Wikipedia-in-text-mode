 "text": "Brazilian jiu-jitsu (Portuguese pronunciation: [dʒɪwˈdʒitsu], English: /dʒuːˈdʒɪtsuː/) is a martial art, combat sport, and a self-defense system. It focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was founded by Helio Gracie who was part of the famous Gracie family. He combined the grappling used in Judo but focused it towards ground fighting. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu often involves the gi but can also be trained without it, wearing only a rash guard. Like Judo it has many chokes and joint locks, but also includes leg-based submissions and strangles. Category:Martial arts Category:Sport in Brazil",
