 "text": "A vacuum cleaner, also spelled \"vacuum-cleaner\", is a device that cleans dust and dirt from floors. Sometimes it is just called a vacuum. The word vacuum comes from the fact that it uses the force of a vacuum to suck dirt into a large chamber from which it can be dumped into the garbage. In the 1920s, an Ohio janitor named James Murray Spangler created a carpet sweeping contraption out of a soap box, a broom handle, a pillowcase, and an electric motor. He then began to sell his machine to local housewives. The first plastic vacuum cleaner was produced in the 1930s, and the precursor to modern central vac systems was created in 1952 by the Hoover Company, whose name was now synonymous with “vacuuming”. By the 1960s, vacuum cleaners were much more lightweight and easy to use. There are several types of vacuum cleaners: * Upright vacuum cleaners * Canister vacuum cleaners * Robot vacuum cleaners * Handheld vacuum cleaners * Car vacuum cleaners * Carpet cleaners ==References== Category:Home appliances",
