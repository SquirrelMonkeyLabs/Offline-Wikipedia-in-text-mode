 "text": "Macrolepidoptera is a group in the insect order Lepidoptera. Originally, it was a catch-all informal term like 'micromoth'. However, it is now reformed to make a good monophyletic group. In the reformed Macrolepidoptera, the following superfamilies are included: * Mimallonoidea – sack bearers * Lasiocampoidea – lappet moths * Bombycoidea – bombycoid moths * Noctuoidea – owlet moths * Drepanoidea – drepanids * Geometroidea – inchworms * Axioidea – European gold moths * Calliduloidea – Old World butterfly-moths * Hedyloidea – New World butterfly-moths (or moth-butterflies) * Hesperioidea – skippers * Papilionoidea – true butterflies The last three make up the Rhopalocera, or butterflies.
