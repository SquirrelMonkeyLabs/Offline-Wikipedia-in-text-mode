 "text": "The Shang dynasty (existed from 1600BC - 1046BC) was the second dynasty in China following the Xia dynasty. Most of what we know about the Shang Dynasty is from reading pictures on oracle bones and bronze objects. A dynasty is a series of rulers which are considered to be part of the same family because they are ruling a country over generations. According to tradition, the last Shang king was overthrown in 1046 BC. The succeeding dynasty was called the Zhouh dynasty. ==Capitals== The Shang moved their capital c. five times. * Bo (either modern Yanshi or Zhengzhou) * Ao (near modern Zhengzhou) * Yan (near modern Qufu) * Xiang (near modern Anyang) * Yinxu (picture; near modern Anyang) * Zhaoge (map; near modern Qi County, Hebi) == Kings == Order # of years Rulers 01 29 King Tang of Shang of China 02 02 Da Ding of Shang 03 32 King Bu Bing of Shang of China 04 04 Zhong Ren 05 12 Tai Jia 06 29 Wo Ding 07 25 Tai Geng 08 17 Xiao Jia 09 12 Yong Ji 10 75 Tai Wu 11 11 Zhong Ding 12 15 Wai Ren 13 09 He Dan Jia 14 19 Zu Yi 15 16 Zu Xin 16 20 Wo Jia 17 32 Zu Ding 18 29 Ding Wang 19 07 King Yang Jia 20 28 Pan Geng 21 29 Xiao Xin of Shang 22 21 Xiao Yi of Shang 23 59 Wu Ding 24 12 Geng of Shang 25 20 Zu Jia 26 06 Lin Xin 27 06 Geng Ding 28 35 Wu Yi 29 11 Wen Ding 30 26 Di Ying 31 30 Di Xin == References == == Other websites == *Zhengzhou Shang City Site Category:Chinese dynasties Category:17th century BC Category:11th century BC",
