 "text": "Tetris Attack is a puzzle video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy that was released in 1996. It was developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. It is the first game in the Puzzle League series. It was originally known as Panel de Pon in Japan and had different characters, but the characters were replaced with characters from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island when the game was made in English. ==Gameplay== Players clear blocks that come down by lining them up in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. The lines have to have the same kind of block. As new blocks come down, the playfield rises. If it makes it to the top, the player loses. The player can stop the playfield from rising by clearing blocks. In two-player games, clearing more than one line at once making combos causes \"garbage\" blocks to come down on the opponent's side of the field. Garbage blocks can be cleared by clearing lines below it. There are several single-player modes. In Story Mode, the player plays through the game's story. The player faces against opponents in head-to-head matches. The player has to make their opponent lose by causing their playfield to make it to the top. In Endless Mode, the player plays as long as possible; with the speed becoming faster over time. In Timed Mode, the player has to score as many points as possible in two minutes. In Stage Clear, the player goes through a series of stages where they have to clear blocks below a line. In Puzzle Mode, the player goes through puzzles where they have to clear blocks in a certain amount of moves. There are also multiplayer modes which are two- player versions of the single-player modes. ==Other websites== * * Category:1996 video games Category:Yoshi games Category:Intelligent Systems games Category:Game Boy games Category:Nintendo Research & Development 1 games Category:Nintendo video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
