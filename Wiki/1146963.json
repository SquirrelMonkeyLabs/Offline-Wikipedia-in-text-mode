 "text": "The Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba (, Imārat Qurṭuba) was an independent Muslim emirate established in al-Andalus (present-day Spain and Portugal) by Abd al- Rahman I in 756. The emirate marked a significant period in Islamic and Iberian history, laying the groundwork for the future Caliphate of Córdoba, which would later become a center of cultural, scientific, and economic prosperity in Medieval Europe. == History == Following the Umayyad Caliphate's overthrow by the Abbasid Caliphate in 750, Abd al-Rahman I, the last surviving Umayyad prince, escaped to al-Andalus. Arriving in 756, he seized control of Córdoba, proclaiming himself emir and establishing the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba as a separate entity from the Abbasids in Baghdad. This created an independent Muslim state in al-Andalus, ushering in centuries of Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula. == References == Category:Former countries in Europe Category:Córdoba, Andalusia Category:750s establishments Category:920s disestablishments Category:History of Spain",
