 "text": "Clint Malarchuk (born May 1, 1961 in Grande Prairie, Alberta) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 11 seasons in the NHL. He played 5 seasons with the Quebec Nordiques, 2 seasons with the Washington Capitals and 4 seasons with the Buffalo Sabres. He is probably best known for the serious throat injury that he received from a skate blade during a game. ==Injury== On March 22, 1989, Malarchuk was injured during a game between the Sabres and St. Louis Blues. Steve Tuttle of the St. Louis Blues and Uwe Krupp of the Buffalo Sabres became entangled when they were chasing the puck and they both crashed into Malarchuk's net, Tuttle's skate hit Malarchuk on the neck and severed his internal carotid artery which caused puddles of blood that collected on the ice. Malarchuk left the ice on his own two feet but he thought he was going to die so he said \"All I wanted to do was get off the ice\". \"My mother was watching the game on TV, and I didn't want her to see me die.\" He knew that his mother was watching the game on TV and he had an equipment manager call and tell her he loved her. He also asked for a priest. His life was saved when the team's trainer, Jim Pizzutelli who was a former Army medic who had served in Vietnam. had reached into Malarchuk's neck and pinched off the bleeding. He did not let go until the doctors arrived to begin closing the wound. After the doctors spent 90 minutes and used over 300 stitches to close the wound he returned to practice four days later and was back in the net against the Quebec Nordiques after about a week. He made in time for the playoffs but the Sabres lost to the Boston Bruins 4 games to 1. Malarchuk suffered mental health issues from this incident later on. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. On October 7, 2008, Malarchuk attempted to commit suicide with a .22 Long Rifle. In November 2014, he released an autobiography called The Crazy Game also known by the title A Matter of Inches—How I Survived In The Crease And Beyond in the United States. Since the book release, Malarchuk and his wife have traveled around speaking about mental health issues and suicide prevention. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Fredericton Express players Category:Ice hockey people from Alberta Category:International Hockey League (1945–2001) players Category:Portland Winterhawks players Category:Quebec Nordiques players Category:Rochester Americans players Category:Washington Capitals players",
