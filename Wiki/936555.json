She is the wife of Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, Mexico's most-wanted drug lord until he was imprisoned for life.

Coronel served a three year prison sentence and was released in September 2023. Coronel was born July 2, 1989, near San Francisco, California, US, to Blanca Estela Aispuro Aispuro and Inés Coronel Barreras, a cattle rancher. She grew up in the remote Durango village of La Angostura. She entered the 2007 Coffee and Guava Festival beauty pageant in Canelas, Durango, Mexico. Each contestant was required to host a party in honor of her candidacy; Coronel held hers on Three Kings Day. In this event, Coronel reportedly met Guzman who traveled to Canelas to meet her.
