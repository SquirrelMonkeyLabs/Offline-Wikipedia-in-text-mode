The magazine talked about anything that dealt with the PlayStation. Topics included its hardware, software, and culture. It covered new video game releases and critics gave reviews on games available on PlayStation One, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The magazine was known for its free demos it included in each issue. The demos were upcoming or new video games that might be interesting to buy by the player.
