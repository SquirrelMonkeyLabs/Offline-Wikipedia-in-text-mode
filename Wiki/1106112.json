 "text": "Buergeria is a group of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae. They are the only group of frogs in the smaller family Buergeriinae. These frogs are like for the frogs in Rhacophorinae. Differences in the frogs' DNA show that these groups are real. People call Buergeria Buerger's frogs in English. There are four species. They live from Hainan (China) and Taiwan through the Ryukyu Islands to Honshu (Japan). ==Appearance== Buergeria are medium-sized to large frogs, long from nose to rear end that look like the frogs in Rana more than other frogs in Rhacophoridae do. Their skin is smooth and they have no dorsal ornamentations. Their back feet have a lot of webbed skin and their front feet have webbed skin about halfway. The female frog lays large numbers of eggs in water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles. ==Species== There are six species in Buergeria: * Buergeria buergeri (Temminck & Schlegel, 1838) — Kajika Frog * Buergeria choui Matsui & Tominaga, 2020 * Buergeria japonica (Hallowell, 1861) — Ryukyu Kajika Frog * Buergeria otai Wang, Hsiao, Lee, Tseng, Lin, Komaki & Lin, 2018 * Buergeria oxycephala (Boulenger, 1900) * Buergeria robusta (Boulenger, 1909) ==Danger== The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says one of the four species is in some danger of dying out (Buergeria oxycephala), and the others are not in danger of dying out. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
