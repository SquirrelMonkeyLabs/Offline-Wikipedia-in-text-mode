 "text": "Aleph one, written as \\aleph_1, is an infinite cardinal number following aleph null (\\aleph_0). It is the cardinality (size) of the set of numbers of possible arrangements for all countably infinite sets. Under the continuum hypothesis, it is also the cardinality of the real numbers. Aleph one is followed by aleph two, \\aleph_2, even with an infinite amount of time you could simply never list every single element or number in any uncountable set. == Related pages == * Infinity * Uncountable set == References == Category:Mathematics Category:Cardinal numbers",
