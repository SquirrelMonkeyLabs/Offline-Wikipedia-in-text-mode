The adult male frog is about 30.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 38.7 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is light brown in color with darker brown marks. There is a gray- brown mark between the eyes. The nose is lighter in color than the back. There is a black-brown mark from the tip of the nose to the eye to the armpit. The eardrum is gray-brown in color. All four legs and the sides of the body are yellow-brown in color. The belly is light gray with dark gray spots. People have seen this frog in forests that have been cut down and are growing back and near coffee farms. People have seen this frog in the dead leaves on the ground. People have seen this frog 1176 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole because other frogs in Indirana do. Scientists do not know how much danger this frog is in, but there is one protected park in its home: Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. Scientists named the frog bhadrai for the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
