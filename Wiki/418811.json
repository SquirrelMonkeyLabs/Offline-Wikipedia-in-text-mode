 "text": "A file hosting service is an Internet service that stores files for its users. It allows users to upload files that could then be accessed over the internet from a different computer, tablet, smart phone or other networked device, after a password is provided. The files can possibly also be accessed by other users, depending on the service or what the user prefers. A variation of this is one-click hosting, which allows users to easily upload one or more files from their hard drives (or from a remote location) on to the one-click host's server. Many web services provide free one-click hosting for image files. This gives the file an accessible URL that can be used to identify it on the internet. == Related pages == * File sharing == References == Category:File sharing",
