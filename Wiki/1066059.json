The adult male frog is 16.3 â€“ 18.4 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is gray-green in color. There are orange bumps on the head and some orange color on the back. The sides of the body are gray-yellow in color with dark brown marks. Parts of the belly are gray-yellow in color. The belly is gray-yellow in color. The bottoms of the toes of the front feet are gray in color. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities, to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. Scientists named this frog for Russell Mittermeier. He was President of Conservation International. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
