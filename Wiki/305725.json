 "text": "The French Civil Aviation University (French: École nationale de l'aviation civile), also known as ENAC,ENAC is a French acronym. ENAC stands for \"École Nationale de l'Aviation Civile\". is a French public aeronautical grande école. It was created on 28 August 1949. It has locations in Biscarosse, Carcassonne, Castelnaudary, Château-Arnoux-Saint-Auban, Grenoble, Melun, Montpellier, Muret, Saint-Yan and Toulouse, in France. It is a member of the Conférence des Grandes Écoles, the University of Toulouse, and of the Aerospace Valley. It is one of five founders of France AEROTECH.France Aérotech, un nouveau réseau pour l’aéronautique et le spatial ENAC provides training in civil aeronautics. The university has around 25 courses. These include aerospace engineering, Masters, Mastères Spécialisés, and courses for technicians, airline pilots, air traffic controllers, managers and flight instructors (people who teach others to fly planes). == History == === 1945 - 1949 === Air travel grew rapidly in France after World War II. Safe air transport required staff trained specifically for this activity. It also required people in different sectors of the aviation world to work together and understand each other. That is why ENAC was started.50 ans d'Énac p.13 Max Hymans, the secretary general of civil and commercial aviation, was the chief organiser. === 1949 - 1955 === ENAC started on 28 August 1949 (Decree 49-1205) in Paris. The university was in Orly, south of Paris. René Lemaire considers ENAC as \"a university of aviation safety\".Speech on the 3th of March 1951 A report of the Inspection générale de l'aviation civile said: \"It was in the minds of the creators of the university, to develop between the crew and the ground staff a community of ideas, reciprocal knowledge, and esteem, that are essential for the teamwork required by air transport.\" Training courses were longer or shorter depending on specialty.50 ans d'Énac p.25René LEMAIRE, 1952 === 1955 - 1959 === The decree of 13 October 1959 announced the first partner of the university: Air France.50 ans d'Énac p.28 It resulted in a sharing of tasks. It also established recruitment for airline pilots students with no previous flight experience. In 1958, the university had already welcomed the first airline pilots students, on an experimental basis. ENAC cooperated with the National School of Meteorology. It promoted the teaching of this subject for air traffic controllers.50 ans d'Énac p.32 After World War II, ENAC helped the conversion of military aircrew. The Service de l'aviation légère et sportive (SALS), under the decree of 31 March 1951, provided free flight training for airline pilot candidates coming from the army.50 ans d'Énac p.33 From 1949 to 1959, the number of courses increased from 6 to 64. The number of students increased from 49 to 800.50 ans d'Énac p.34 In 1956, the navigation instructor rating was created. A training programme also started. In 1958, the airline pilot theoretical training course started.50 ans d'Énac p.35 It had rites such as a reception in full uniform by local authorities when university officials and students arrived at a new location.50 ans d'Énac p.45 ENAC Orly also held a yearly trip for all the students. === 1959 - 1968 === The university moved to Toulouse in 1968.Plaquette de présentation de l'ENAC The main campus is still there in 2020. It also changed from an external department of the French civil aviation administration to a public administration institution in 1970.50 ans d'Énac p.55 The French Civil Aviation University was started close to Paris-Orly Airport. This l was the largest French airport at the time. It offered easy use of airplanes for a lot of activities such as navigation flights and promotional trips. It was also close to many airlines and aircraft manufacturers or businesses related to the aviation industry. The managers of these businesses often gave lectures and conferences at the university. Traffic at Paris-Orly Airport grew rapidly at the beginning of the 1950s. In the mid-1950s plans began for a new location near to Parisian airports.50 ans d'Énac p.57 The potential locations were all less than 150 km from Paris, for example Melun, Pontoise, Coulommiers, Étampes, Reims, Évreux, Chartres, and Orleans. A report dated 20 May 1959 lists the disadvantages of a location too far from Paris.50 ans d'Énac p.58 René Lemaire gave a report on 14 June 1960 in which he supported a transfer to Toulouse.50 ans d'Énac p.59 The École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de constructions aéronautiques settled in Toulouse in 1961 and the École nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace50 ans d'Énac p.61 was also going to move from Paris to Toulouse. The construction of new buildings on the campus of Rangueil began in April 1966.50 ans d'Énac p.79 The project ended on 19 August 1968. The academic year started on 16 September 1968. 500 students started, including 325 who started their training. These trainees were as follows: 15 air navigation engineering students (mostly from the École Polytechnique), 70 engineering students in air navigation from two-years studies after the French Baccalaureate (the main end of school exams in France), 60 airline pilot students, 100 air traffic controller students, 40 electronics students, 20 commercial pilot students and 20 flight dispatcher students.50 ans d'Énac p.81 === 1968 - 1975 === Before the university opened its doors to its new campus, the Commission permanente took into consideration the problem of an inadequate (not good enough) legal status. This problem was old. It was identified soon after the creation of the university. ENAC was supervised closely. There were many inspection reports. On average, these usually happened once every two years, sometimes more often.50 ans d'Énac p.87 The management of the institution was judged strictly. In the mid-1950s, some reports said the university was not allowed to exist, for example, the confidential report of Brancourt Controller on 12 March 1952. Some reports said that the university had \"a lack of doctrine\", and that \"there is a certain tension with the training center of Air France\", and even that \"ENAC is madness\". The final decision is taken by Decree No. 70-347 of 13 April 1970. It was applied on 1 January 1971. ENAC received a board of directors when it became a public administrative institution. René Lemaire was the first president.50 ans d'Énac p.91 === 1975 - 1990 === From 1975 the proportion of engineering students called \"civilians\" increased over the \"officials\" (civil servants) engineering students. it was in 1956 that the first students for the private sector were trained . At the end of 1950s, however, this was only a minority of students.50 ans d'Énac p.101 ENAC engineering education, particularly that of the specialty called \"facilities\" - it focuses on electronics - seduced the industrial sectors of electronics and information technology. Without having particularly desired it, the university became a National University of Engineers. Industry oriented university research appeared in 1984, following the law on Higher education which provides that \"engineering education [...] has a research activity, basic or applied,50 ans d'Énac p.125 \" and is organized around four areas: electronics, automation, computer and air transport economy. The mid 1980s saw the emergence of mastères spécialisés programs. They come from an industrial demand, including the groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales, in order to support the export contracts by training.50 ans d'Énac p.130 Indeed, while filling the needs of many French students or professionals, they can train foreign executives. The same period saw the diversification of continuing education50 ans d'Énac p.129 at the university. The continuing education courses are organized in five main areas: air traffic systems, electronics, computer, aeronautics and languages/humanities.50 ans d'Énac p.131 === 1990 - today === The international dimension of the university grew in the 1990s..50 ans d'Énac p.133 It consists first in the participation in European projects such as EATCHIP (European Air Traffic control Harmonization and Integration Program), then in joining mobility programs for students such as Erasmus or Socrates. Under these programs, the university welcomes a growing number of foreign students. In doing so, it forges close relations with foreign universities, including those of Berlin and Darmstadt in Germany, and Tampere in Finland. The 2000s are the years of the creation of courses entirely taught in English language and the development of activities focused on air navigation.50 ans d'Énac p.146 In 2009, the university and its alumni association organize the first edition of the salon du livre aéronautique (aeronautical literary festival) in Toulouse.Le livre prend son envol au salon de l'ENAC In December 2010, ENAC becomes an ICAO center for training in aviation security.Le Centre de formation à la sûreté de l’ENAC agréé par l’OACI The university developed new teaching facilities: the air traffic control simulator \"CAUTRA\", the aerodrome control simulator \"AERSIM\", an Airbus A320 flight management system simulator, a static model of the Airbus A321' s engine and the laboratory of telecom networks.50 ans d'Énac p.143 Since the 1st January 2011 and the merging of ENAC with the SEFA, the university is the biggest European aviation university.La France dispose de la plus grande école d’aviation européenne In 2013, ENAC starts with the DGAC the consulting company France Aviation Civile Services. === Heads history === The current head of the university is Olivier Chansou, after Marc HouallaMarc Houalla le pilote du changement who was SEFA director from 2006 till the 1th of January 2011.Marc HOUALLA He is the eighth person to be director since 1949.
