 "text": "Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park is a provincial park located in central Alberta, Canada, located approximately 103 km south of Red Deer and 16 km east of Trochu. The park is located along the Red Deer River and is formed by Badlands. Its name derives from the large plateau in the middle of the park, 200 m above the Red Deer River, which has never been developed by humans and retains its pristine grasslands. The park is located at an altitude ranging from 720 m to 875 m and has an area of 15.9 km2. The park is the site of an ancient buffalo jump, where Indigenous people used to push bison herds to the cliffs to sustain themselves. The hills also have rare flora and fauna. The park contains the largest Albertosaurus deposit in the world, discovered by Barnum Brown in the early twentieth century and developed by Dr. Phil Currie in 1997.
