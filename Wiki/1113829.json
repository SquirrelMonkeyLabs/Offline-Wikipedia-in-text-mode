Seven other people were on the plane. == Crash == The plane couldn't be seen on radar after the plane took off, with aviation officials not being able to talk to the plane. The plane being gone caused a search and rescue to find the plane. Bad weather was present along the path the plane was supposed to take and bystanders said that a plane had crashed in the Chikangwa Forest area. The Vice-President's phone was said to be detected at around 10:30 a.m. Authorities said the plane had turned around because the pilots could not see very well. The crash was found by Malawi Defence Force soldiers in the forest on 11 June. Nobody survived the crash. == Related pages == * 2024 Varzaqan helicopter crash == References == Category:History of Malawi Category:2024 in Africa Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2024 Category:2020s disasters in Africa Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Africa Category:June 2024 events",
