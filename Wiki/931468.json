Some videos are edited to meet a general TV-PG rating, or replaced with a lyric video instead. == History == The network was launched on May 1, 2002 as MTV Hits. The network was named for a daily program on MTV also called MTV Hits. It was MTV's main pop music video program. The network included current hit music videos, along with a few older videos from earlier in the year, as well as a few from the late 1990s. The network maintained a commercial-free format, other than internal promotions for MTV and MTV-branded properties. In 2005, the network began airing a feature called \"My Hitlist Month\". It was based on viewer selected playlists that were submitted to a new network website. My Hitlist Month, along with artist- selected playlists, were broadcast occasionally on the network until 2006. In 2016, MTV Hits was re-branded NickMusic. Category:American television networks Category:American television channels Category:2002 establishments in the United States",
