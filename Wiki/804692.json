She was appointed as administrator in 2017 by President Donald Trump. She was criticized for her actions after the 2020 presidential election in delaying the start of the transition to a Joe Biden administration after Biden won the election on November 7. Murphy at first did not want to sign a letter allowing Biden's transition team to access federal agencies and transition funds. She signed the letter on November 23, allowing the presidential transition process to begin. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from St. Louis, Missouri Category:Politicians from St. Louis, Missouri Category:Businesspeople from St. Louis, Missouri Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:Administrators of the General Services Administration",
