 "text": "Rudolph William Louis \"Rudy\" Giuliani (born May 28, 1944) is a politician from New York in the United States. He is a Republican and campaigned to become President of the United States in 2008. Giuliani was mayor of New York City from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2001. Giuliani became more well known during and after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. In 2001, Time magazine named him \"Person of the Year\" and he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2002, and acclaimed as one of the greatest mayors in American history. Rudy was campaigning in 1993 with the show Seinfeld where he appeared as the NYC Mayor candidate as the \"over count\" cholesterol man by eating too much yogurt. This \"product placement\" of Mayor Giuliani is often referred to as an excellent example of electioneering and boosted his popularity accordingly. On January 12, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump named Giuliani his Cyber Security Adviser. Giuliani was also an important person in the Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, where he was accused of being one of the people who asked the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden. ==References== == Other websites == *Joinrudy2008.com - Presidential campaign site Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:American political commentators Category:Mayors of New York City Category:New York University alumni Category:Politicians from Brooklyn Category:Time People of the Year Category:2008 United States presidential candidates Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
