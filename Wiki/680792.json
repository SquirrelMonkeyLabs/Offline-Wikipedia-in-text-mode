He was technically King of France and Navarre for less than 20 minutes before he himself abdicated. He gave up being the King, after his father also did. This occurred in the July Revolution of 1830. He never ruled over the country. After his father's death in 1836 he was called Louis XIX. ==References== Category:1775 births Category:1844 deaths Category:Kings of France Category:19th-century monarchs of France",
