Leipzig City has its own government. == History == The district was formed in 1994 by joining the old districts of Leipzig, Borna and Geithain. The area south of Leipzig City is a big lignite mining area. It will be turned lakeland in the near future. The lignite made the Leipzig area the biggest industrial part of East Germany. == Coat of arms == The lion to the right is the symbol of the Counts of Meißen, the vertical blue stripes (called pales in heraldry) in the bottom are the symbol of Landsberg. Both symbols are also in the coat of arms of the city of Leipzig.
