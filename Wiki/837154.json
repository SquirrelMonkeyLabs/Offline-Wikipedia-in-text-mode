 "text": "Hissène Habré (Arabic: Ḥusaīn Ḥabrī, Chadian Arabic: ; ; 13 August 1942 - 24 August 2021), also spelled Hissen Habré, was a Chadian politician who served as the President of Chad from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990. France and the United States gave them training, arms, and financing to rule Chad. In May 2016, Habré was found guilty by an international court in Senegal of human- rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison. He is the first former head of state to be convicted for human rights abuses in the court of another nation. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, he was released from prison so that he would not catch COVID-19. He went into house arrest for 60 days. Habré died in Dakar, Senegal from COVID-19 on 24 August 2021, one week after his 79th birthday. == References == Category:1942 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Heads of state of Chad Category:Prime ministers of Chad Category:Former dictators Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Senegal",
