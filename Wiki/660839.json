Many foreshocks followed, the largest of which was a magnitude 6.1 tremor that occurred earlier that day. In the aftermath, a tsunami struck Palu, sweeping shore-lying houses and buildings on its way. The combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami led to the deaths of at least 4,340 people and injured 10,679 people. This is the deadliest earthquake in Indonesia since 2006. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management (ACDM) must play a key role. They should coordinate and extend assistance to Indonesia. This support is crucial after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi. ==References== Category:2018 disasters in Asia Category:2018 earthquakes Category:2018 disasters in Indonesia Category:Earthquakes in Indonesia 2018 earthquake Category:September 2018 events Category:2010s tsunamis",
