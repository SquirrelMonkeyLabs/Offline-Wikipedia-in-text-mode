In the United States, it is the responsibility of the mother's physician, midwife, or a hospital administrator to prepare the official birth certificate. The birth certificate itself is not proof of a person's identity, but only a record stating that a birth occurred at the time, date, and place stated on the certificate. To prove one's identity, a person may need a photo ID, generally issued to an adult. ==Related pages== *Vital record *Passport == Other websites == *U.S. Standard Birth Certificate *Florida Short Form (Computer Certification) Birth Certificate Sample *Florida Long Form (Photocopy) Birth Certificate Sample *U.S. Birth Certificates: Long Form vs. Short Form Category:Identification documents",
