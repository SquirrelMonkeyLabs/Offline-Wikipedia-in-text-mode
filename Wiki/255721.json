Pratt was ordered to take anger management classes, but even after that, they would not rehire him and his wife. Montag had also filed charges against The Hills creator Adam Divello, claiming sexual harassment. ==Music career== Montag started working on her own music album in 2007. In 2009, she performed her song \"Body Language\" on the Miss Universe beauty pageant show in the Bahamas. Her performance was disliked by critics and many other people.
