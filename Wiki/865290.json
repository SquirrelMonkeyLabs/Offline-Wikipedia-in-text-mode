 "text": "Overwatch was a 2016 team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game created and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2016 and released on the Nintendo Switch in October 2019. Overwatch puts players into two teams of six, with each player selecting their a character from a varied selection known as \"heroes\", with their own unique abilities and powers. The two teams work against each other to complete map-specific jobs within a short time span. Blizzard added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to purchase cosmetic items. Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major franchise. Its origins came after a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Titan, was cancelled. The developers of the game based it off other first-person shooters, such as Team Fortress 2. Some elements of Overwatch borrow concepts from the canceled Titan project. A sequel, Overwatch 2, was announced in 2019, and released on October 4, 2022. ==References== Category:2016 video games Category:Blizzard video games Category:Square Enix games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Esports games Category:First-person shooters Category:Hero shooters Category:LGBT-related video games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Superhero video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Greece Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Paris Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
