Distributed by Golden Harvest. == Game of Death (book) == * In 1975, before Clouse’s Game of Death or any of the Bruceploitation Game of Death movies came out, a book titled “Game of Death” was published in Japan. It told the story of a former martial arts champion whose sister and brother were kidnapped, and who was blackmailed into raiding a martial artist-filled pagoda to retrieve a priceless artifact. This book claimed to be based on The Game of Death’s original story, and John Little’s discovery of Bruce’s outline, twenty years later, pretty much confirms this. They even got minor details correct, like Kareem having lizard eyes.Game of Death (book) from the book Game Over! by Joe Kenney on Cityonfire == Special Features == * Game of Death Redux (Prequel and sequel: The Story) == Related pages == * Sequel: Game of Death II == References == == Other websites == * Category:1978 action movies Category:Hong Kong action movies Category:Movies directed by Robert Clouse Category:Golden Harvest movies",
