 "text": "Phyllodytes praeceptor is a frog. It lives in the state of Bahia in Brazil not far from the ocean. People have also seen it in Serra da Jiboia, 694 m above sea level. The adult male frog is 20.7-25.8 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog has large eyes. This frog is not in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in such a large place. Human beings cut down much of its forest during the past hundred years, but the forest is so big that there is still a large place left. This frog lives in forests where the branches of the trees come together like a roof. This frog lives on bromeliad plants that live on large trees. The female frog lays eggs in the plant and the tadpoles swim in the water in the middle of the plant. Human beings grow cacao under trees to shade the cacao plants. These frogs can live on these farm trees too. This is another reason why the frogs are not in danger. Scientists think that the frogs might be in danger if people take away their bromeliad plants, but they do not think anyone is doing this as of 2021. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
