 "text": "David Hume divided knowledge into two categories “relations of ideas”, and “matters of fact”. Relations of ideas are truthful and correct statements (for example “all unmarried men are bachelors”). Matters of fact are statements we are nearly certain are truthful but there is still a chance for it to be false: “the sun will rise in the morning”: there is a chance it will not rise.
