 "text": "The Valley of the Queens ( ) is a place in Egypt where wives of Pharaohs were buried in ancient times. In ancient times, it was known as Ta-Set-Neferu, meaning â€“\"the place of beauty\". X1:G1-Q1-X1:O1-F35-F35-F35 The reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The place is near the worker's village in Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings. Another consideration may be the existence of a sacred grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may be associated with rejuvenation for the dead.Demas, Martha, and Neville Agnew, eds. 2012. Valley of the Queens Assessment Report: Volume 1.
