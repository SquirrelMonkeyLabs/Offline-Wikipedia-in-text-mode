 "text": "The Sarah Jane Adventures was a science fiction television series, that started in 2007 and ended in 2011, due to Elisabeth Sladen's death. It was a spin off from the British cult series Doctor Who. The series starred Elisabeth Sladen as the journalist Sarah Jane Smith, who was a companion of the Third and Fourth Doctor in the classic Doctor Who series. Sladen played the original part of Sarah Jane from 1973 until 1976. Sarah Jane was considered the most popular companion of the Doctor and appeared in the new series episode \"School Reunion\" along with her robot dog, K-9. Unlike the other spin off of Doctor Who, Torchwood, the target audience for The Sarah Jane Adventures was children as it is shown on CBBC. == Connections to Doctor Who == The series featured many connections to Doctor Who. The Slitheen family, who first appeared in the Doctor Who episode \"Aliens of London\" appeared in two stories in the first series, and the Sontarans, who first appeared in the Doctor Who story The Time Warrior featured in two stories in the Second series. The character Doctor Who also appeared in the episodes \"The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith\" (played by David Tennant) and \"Death of the Doctor\" (played by Matt Smith). Doctor Who also used ideas from The Sarah Jane Adventures.
