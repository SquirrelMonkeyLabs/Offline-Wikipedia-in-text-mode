 "text": "This article is about the ethnic minorities in Azerbaijan. ==Data== Although more than 94% of the people are ethnic Azerbaijanis, Azerbaijan has many ethnic minorities including Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians, Jews and other minorities. However, the numbers of most of these ethnic minorities are small. ==History== After the end of the Soviet Union with the independence of Azerbaijan and the Nagorno-Karabakh War, almost all Armenians (outside the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh) fled or were deported from the country. At the same time, almost all Azerbaijanis fled or were deported from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Most Russians and other minorities have also left the country and are continuing to leave. As a result, Azerbaijan has become ethnically more \"pure\".
