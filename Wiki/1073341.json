The Maersk Hanghou sent out a call for help. This call was answered by the destroyers USS Gravely and USS Laboon. While responding to the call for assistance, Houthi forces fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles towards the ships. These missiles were shot down by the USS Gravely. No injuries were reported on any ship after the attacks. ==References== Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Houthi Movement Category:December 2023 events",
