 "text": "Rosaceae (rose-like plants) is a large family of plants. There are about 100-120 genera with between 3,000 and 4,000 species that include these well- known plants: *Roses *Strawberries *Raspberries *Apples and pears *Peaches, cherries, and apricots Plants in Rosaceae usually have flowers with five petals. However, some decorative roses have many more. Species of Dryas usually have eight petals. ==Subfamilies== The Rosaceae family was traditionally divided into subfamilies, usually these four: *Rosoideae *Spiraeoideae *Maloideae *Amygdaloideae (sometimes incorrectly called Prunoideae) However, it has become clear that the last three of the subfamilies cannot be divided in a clear way. Also, there is a small group that is so different from other Rosaceae that it is now given its own name. Botanists now use only three subfamilies: *Rosoideae *Amygdaloideae *Dryadoideae Category:Rosaceae",
