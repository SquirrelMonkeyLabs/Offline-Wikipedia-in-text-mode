 "text": "The leopard rocket frog or Mucubají skunk frog (Aromobates leopardalis) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== The adult frogs live in grassy places called páramo, in places with small, woody plants called sub-páramo, and in cloud forests. It lives in the very highest parts of the Venezuelan Andes. This place is almost like an alpine tundra. In these places, the frog lives in rocky places near streams with grass and other plants. Scientists saw the frog between 2400 and 3300 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog in Parque Nacional Sierra Nevada. ==Smell== Both the adult frogs and tadpoles can make smells that seem bad to human beings. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. They think there are no more than fifty adult frogs alive now. Scientists are not sure why so many frogs died, but other frogs in the same place died from the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which gave them the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Scientists also think water pollution killed some frogs and that trout fish that people brought to the frogs' home killed the frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
