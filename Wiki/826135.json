VII To keep that divine emblem, Let us march, oh fatherland, to death, Generous will be our fate, If we die thinking of your love. Defending your holy flag And covered in your glorious folds, There will be many, Honduras, of your dead, But all will fall with honour. ===Full lyrics=== Spanish original English translation Your flag, your flag is a splendour of sky Crossed by a block, by a block of snow; And seen on its sacred background Are five stars of pale blue; On your emblem, which a roaring sea Shields with its rough waves, Behind the bare summit of a volcano, of a volcano, There is a star, there is a star of clear light. I A virgin and beautiful Indian, you were sleeping To the resonant song of your seas, When thrown into your basins of gold The bold navigator found you; And looking at your beauty, ecstatic At the ideal influence of your charm, The blue hem of your splendid mantle He consecrated with his kiss of love. II From a country where the sun rises, Beyond the blue Atlantean, That man had dreamt of you And in search of you launched himself into the sea. When you raised your pale forehead, In the lively anxiety of your longing, Under the gentle dome of your sky A foreign banner was already floating. III It was useless that the Indian, your beloved, Prepare to fight with ire, Because, enveloped in his blood, Lempira Sank into the deep night; And of the epic feat, in memory, The legend alone has kept From a tomb the unknown place And the harsh profile of a crag. IV For three centuries your children listened To the imperative mandate of the master; For three centuries your useless complaint Was lost in the blue atmosphere; But one glorious day your ear Perceived, powerful and distant, That far away, over the Atlante, A Lion roared indignantly. V It was France, the free, the heroic, That in her sleep of centuries asleep Awoke angry to life At the virile complaint of Danton: It was France, that sent to death The head of the consecrated King, And that raised proud at his side, The altar of the goddess reason. VI You too, oh my fatherland!, arose From your servile and deep sleep; You also taught the world The infamous shattered link. And in your blessed soil, behind the tall Hair of the wild jungle, Like a bird of black plumage, The fleeting colony was lost. VII To keep that divine emblem, Let us march, oh fatherland, to death, Generous will be our fate, If we die thinking of your love. Defending your holy flag And covered in your glorious folds, There will be many, Honduras, of your dead, But all will fall with honour. ==References== Category:Honduran culture Category:North American anthems",
