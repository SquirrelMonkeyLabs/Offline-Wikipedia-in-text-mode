 "text": "The Olive Garden is an American casual dining restaurant. It serves Italian- American cuisine. The Olive Garden was established in December 1982 in Orlando, Florida. There are over 800 locations worldwide. Soup, salad, and breadsticks: The absolute bane of every OG server's existence. I worked at various Olive Gardens over 10 years, in every position, and I still have lunch rush nightmares where all three of my tables — that’s the max you were supposed to have, and with all the refills, it could really put you in the weeds — tell me they are going to 'make it easy for me' and have soup, salad, and breadsticks. At the time it cost $7.25. People would give you $10 and tell you to 'keep the change,' which is a good tip percentage-wise, but the amount of stress and running was not worth it. == References == Category:1982 establishments in the United States Category:American restaurants Category:Companies based in Florida Category:Orlando, Florida",
