His parents, Jennie and Samuel Bernstein, were Jewish immigrants from Rivne, in what used to be the Russian Empire, but is now Ukraine. When he was born, his grandmother wanted him to be named Louis, so that became his official name. However, his parents called him Leonard. When he was 16 years old, he legally changed his name from Louis to Leonard. Many people, including his friends, called him \"Lenny.\" Bernstein’s mother gave birth to him while she was staying with her parents in Lawrence, Massachusetts. As a baby, he was not very healthy, so he stayed there until he became strong enough to join his father in Boston. Later, he attended Boston Latin School. When Bernstein was 15, his family moved to Newton, Massachusetts, which is close to Boston. Bernstein’s father owned the Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company, which sold machines for permanent hair waving in the 1920s and 1930s. This business made the family wealthy. As a child, Bernstein’s only experience with music was listening to the radio and attending Friday night services at Congregation Mishkan Tefila (a Jewish synagogue) in Roxbury, Massachusetts. When Bernstein was 10, his aunt Clara gave her piano to the Bernsteins. Leonard was very interested and asked for piano lessons. He had several piano teachers as a child, including Helen Coates, who later became his secretary. During summers, the Bernstein family stayed in Sharon, Massachusetts. There, young Leonard organized neighborhood children to perform operas and musicals, such as Carmen and H.M.S. Pinafore. He often played music with his younger sister, Shirley. Leonard also had a younger brother, Burton, who was born 13 years after him. Despite the age differences, the siblings were very close. Bernstein's father, Samuel, did not support Leonard’s interest in music at first. He refused to pay for piano lessons, so Leonard taught piano to neighborhood children to earn money. One of his students, Sid Ramin, became a lifelong friend and later worked with Bernstein to orchestrate West Side Story. Eventually, Samuel began to support Leonard’s love for music and even took him to concerts. In 1932, at the age of 14, Leonard went to his first orchestral concert with the Boston Pops Orchestra, led by Arthur Fiedler. He was deeply inspired, especially by the performance of Ravel’s Boléro. Later, George Gershwin also became a big influence. When Gershwin died in 1937, Bernstein played a piece of Gershwin’s music at a summer camp where he worked as a music counselor as a memorial (a way to show respect and remember someone). Bernstein performed publicly for the first time on March 30, 1932, playing Brahms’s Rhapsody in G Minor at a recital. Two years later, performed for the first time with an orchestra, performing Grieg’s Piano Concerto in A Minor with the Boston Public School Orchestra. Bernstein attended public schools, starting with the William Lloyd Garrison School and then the Boston Latin School. At Boston Latin, he wrote the Class Song with his classmate Lawrence F. Ebb. === 1935-1941 College Years === In 1935, Bernstein studied music at Harvard.There, he met Aaron Copland. He graduated in 1939, cum laude. Next, Bernstein studied at the Curtis Institute of Music. During this time, he studied conducting with Serge Koussevitzky, the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Bernstein graduated with a diploma in conducting from Curtis in 1941. == New York Philharmonic == In September of 1943, Bernstein became the assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic. He was 25 years old. This is very young for the job. On November 19, 1943, Bruno Walter, was sick and couldn't conduct. Bernstein then conducted the New York Philharmonic without practicing first. His first concert was very well liked. The next day, it was the front page story in the New York Times. Many other newspapers across the country published the story. The concert was broadcast on the radio. He became famous. He became the first American-born, American-trained conductor to be internationally famous. This was during time when conductors traditionally came from Europe. == Influences == Bernstein stated that composers like Aaron Copland, Dimitri Mitropoulos, George Gershwin, Gustav Mahler, Kurt Weill, Sergei Koussevitzky, Randall Thompson, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and Robert Schumann were his influences. == References == == Other websites == * Official website Category:1918 births Category:1990 deaths Category:20th-century American composers Category:American conductors Category:American movie score composers Category:Bisexual Jews Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Entertainers from Massachusetts Category:American Grammy Award winners Category:Jewish American LGBT people Category:Jewish American musicians Category:Kennedy Center honorees Category:LGBT musicians Category:LGBT people from Massachusetts Category:People from Lawrence, Massachusetts Category:Tony Award winners",
