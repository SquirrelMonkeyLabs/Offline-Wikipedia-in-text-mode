 "text": "Gun dogs or gundogs, also called bird dogs, are types of dogs used to help hunters find and retrieve game (the animals the hunters are hunting), usually birds. Gundogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Flushing dogs flush game from hiding. Pointer dogs point their muzzle towards game to allow the hunter to locate the animal. Retrievers retrieve game once it is killed. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gundogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. The three most popular types are: Spaniel, Golden Retriever and Labrador. ==Other websites== *Gun dog magazine Category:Working dogs",
