When the Nazis were in power, hundreds of mental subjects were killed or abused at Gugging as part of the Nazi Aktion T4 program. Around 400 people were killed by Doctor Emil Gelny by poisoning and electric shock. Rudolf Lonauer was the doctor for 112 deaths and typically killed his patients, who were mainly women, by an overdose of drugs. == Other websites == *Nazis killed hundreds at Austrian mental hospital Category:Psychology",
