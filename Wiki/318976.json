 "text": ":Not to be confused with Camptosaurus. Camposaurus is a dinosaur from the Late Triassic of North America. It is a relative of Coelophysis. This relationship was upheld by a recent phylogenetic anlysis. With fossils dating back to 205–210 million years ago (mya), it is the oldest known neotheropod. It is known from partial lower leg bones and other fragmentary material.A.P. Hunt et al. 1998. Late Triassic dinosaurs from the western United States. Géobios 31(4): 511-531 A study of Camposaurus arizoniensis by Ezcurra and Brusatte discovered two unique features. Ezcurra M.D. and Brusatte S.L. 2011. Taxonomic and phylogenetic reassessment of the early neotheropod dinosaur Camposaurus arizonensis from the late Triassic of North America. Palaeontology 54 (4): 763–772. This meant the specimen was a valid genus and species. Camposaurus is definitely a neotheropod. Based on phylogenetic analysis, its closest known relative is Megapnosaurus rhodensis, because they share similarities in the tibia, and ankle. Spielman et al. (2007) put Camposaurus in the family Coelophysidae.Spielmann J.A. et al 2007. Oldest records of the Late Triassic theropod dinosaur Coelophysis bauri. In S.G. Lucas & J.A.
