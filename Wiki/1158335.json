 "text": "American Megatrends International, LLC (AMI) is a company that makes computer hardware and software. It works with PC hardware and firmware. The company started in 1985 and was founded by Pat Sarma and Subramonian Shankar. Its main office is at 3095 Satellite Boulevard, Gwinnett County, Georgia, USA, near the city of Duluth and Atlanta. At first, AMI made complete motherboards for high- end computers. Its first customer was a company called PCs Limited, which later became Dell. Over time, making hardware moved to companies in Taiwan. AMI then focused on making BIOS firmware for major motherboard companies. It created BIOS software for motherboards in 1986, server motherboards in 1992, storage controllers in 1995, and remote-management cards in 1998. In 1993, AMI made MegaRAID, a storage controller card. In 2001, AMI sold its RAID business to LSI Corporation. Only one worker from that division stayed with AMI. AMI continued to work on making products for other companies (OEMs and ODMs). Some of its products include: * AMIBIOS (a type of BIOS) * Aptio (a newer BIOS based on UEFI) * Diagnostic software * AMI EC (software for embedded controllers) * MG-Series SGPIO backplane controllers (used in storage devices like SATA, SAS, and NVMe) * Firmware development * MegaRAC (software for managing servers). == References == Category:American software companies",
