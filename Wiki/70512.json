 "text": "Right-wing politics is a kind of politics that supports social or economic conservatism. ==Beliefs== Someone who is \"right-wing\" usually supports tradition and keeping things the way that they already are. The right-wing supports tradition and authority. The right-wing in some countries, like the United States, often supports social conservatism and a capitalist economy where the government has little influence. Usually the right-wing thinks of society as similar to a living thing, what is called \"organic society\". They believe that society's customs and traditions are a collection of things that we have learned from the past and are useful and should be maintained as much as possible. ==Types== People who are very right-wing are called \"reactionary\", and want to either return to the way things were before, such as neoreaction, or more often start as a reaction against left-wing ideas which are spreading in a country or two. ==Famous right-wing politicians== * Silvio Berlusconi * Boris Johnson * Giorgia Meloni * Benjamin Netanyahu * Ronald Reagan * Margaret Thatcher * Donald Trump * Janez Jan≈°a * Jair Bolsonaro * Rishi Sunak == Related pages == * Centrism * Fascism * Left-wing politics * Nationalism * Neoconservatism * Paleoconservatism Category:Conservatism Category:Political movements",
