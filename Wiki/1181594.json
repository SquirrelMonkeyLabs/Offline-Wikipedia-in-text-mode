There is yellow color on the front of the neck. It has a white stripe on each side of its body. The stripe starts from the middle of the body and goes to where the back legs meet the body. The adult male frog's belly is brown and the adult female frog's belly is white with no spots. The iris of the eye is bronze in color. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in streams in forests that have never been cut down. Scientists saw this frog in exactly one place, Cerro Sipapo, 150 meters above sea level. This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in Sierra Tapirapec√≥ and other places. The place where scientists saw the frog is inside a protected park, Monumento Natural Cerro Autana. ==Young== The male frog sits on the dead leaves on the ground and calls to the female frogs. Scientists do not know where the female frog lays eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to ponds near streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Much of its home is far away from places that human beings go to or change. Some visitors come but not many. There is some gold mining, even though this is against the law, but it is not near where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
