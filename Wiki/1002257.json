 "text": "Elizabeth \"Long Liz\" Stride ( Gustafsdotter; 27 November 1843 – 30 September 1888) was probably the third victim of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper killed and mutilated at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 96–113 Unlike the other four Ripper victims, Stride had not been mutilated after her murder. For this reason, some historians think Stride had not actually been murdered by Jack the Ripper.The Complete History of Jack the Ripper p. 210 However, Stride's murder occurred less than one hour before the murder of the Ripper's fourth victim, Catherine Eddowes. The murder occured within walking distance. It is thought that the murderer was disturbed by someone entering the crime scene on a two-wheeled cart.Sherlock Holmes and The Autumn Of Terror p. 483 In addition, both women had been murdered by slash wounds to the throat.Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia p. 98 For these reasons, most authors and researchers consider Stride to be the third of the Ripper's five victims.The Murder Almanac p. 91 Stride was nicknamed \"Long Liz\". Several explanations have been given for this pseudonym; some believe it sources from her married surname (a stride being a reference to a long step),Evans and Rumbelow, p. 290 while others believe this is a reference to either her height,At 5 ft 5 in (165 cm), Stride was taller than the average for Whitechapel women of the era (Fido, p.53). or her general facial structure. ==References== Category:1843 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Victims of Jack the Ripper",
