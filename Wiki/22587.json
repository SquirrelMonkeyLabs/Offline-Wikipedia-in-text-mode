 "text": "Kazan (; ) is the capital city of Tatarstan and one of Russia's largest cities. It is a major industrial, commercial and cultural center, and remains the most important center of Tatar culture. Kazan lies at the meeting of the Volga (İdel) and Kazanka (Qazansu) rivers in central European Russia. == Name == The origin of the name is unclear. The literal translation of Tatar qazan is a boiler or cauldron. Or, it may have come from qazğan, Tatar for dug [ditch]. \"Qazan\" is originally a name for a special cooking pan, a kind of a wok, but heavier. It was believed that the city of Kazan is named after this object because of its geographical similarity with a \"qazan\"-pan; namely the city is in a U - shape lowland. Another, more romantic legend tells a story of a Tatar princess Söyembikä, who dropped a golden dish (golden qazan) into the river on which the city is located while washing it. Nevertheless, Chuvash legends refer to Bulgarian prince Khusan (Chuvash rendering of Muslim name Hassan) and Chuvashes call this city Хусан after the name of this prince. == History == In 2021, nine people were killed in a mass shooting. == Images == Image:KazanAyvazovskiyStreet.jpg|One of the first (wooden) houses in Kazan Image:Kazan_Center_from_Fizkorpus.jpg|Kremlin and City center, as seen from the State University ==References== ==Other websites==",
