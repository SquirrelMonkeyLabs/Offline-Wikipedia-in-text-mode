 "text": "The 1972 Democratic National Convention was the presidential nominating convention of the Democratic Party for the 1972 presidential election. It was held at Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, Florida, on July 10â€“13, 1972. Yvonne Braithwaite Burke was vice-chair, becoming the first African American and the first woman of color to hold that position. The convention nominated Senator George McGovern of South Dakota for president and Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri for vice president. Eagleton withdrew from the race just 19 days later after it was said that he had previously undergone mental health treatment. He was replaced on the ballot by Sargent Shriver of Maryland, a Kennedy in-law. ==References== Category:1972 in the United States Category:1970s in Florida Category:United States presidential nominating conventions Category:Democratic Party (United States) Category:July events",
