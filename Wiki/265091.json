 "text": "The Gram-Schmidt process is a way of converting one set of vectors that forms a basis into another, more friendly one. Suppose we have a set of vectors \\\\{v_{1},...,v_{n}\\\\} that form a basis for R^{n}, and that we wish to convert these into a \"friendly\" basis which is easier to work with later. We begin by finding out which component of a vector is being unfriendly to a second vector, which we may do with inner products. If we have two vectors u,v, then we may find the component of u being unfriendly to v with proj_{u}(v)=\\frac{}{}u. By subtracting this from v, we get the component friendly to u. By returning to our abstract set \\\\{v_{1},...,v_{n}\\\\}, we may make use of this observation to construct a general algorithm to convert an arbitrary basis into a friendly basis. Like from our original set, each time we use the process on a new vector, it is guaranteed to be mutually friendly with all the previous vectors. Define: w_{1} = v_{1} w_{2} = v_{2} - proj_{w_{1}}v_{2} et cetera, with the general term: w_{n}=v_{n}-\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{proj_{w_{i}}v_{n}} Should we wish to make this a friendly and cute basis, we can simply make each new element of the basis cute, by replacing both v_{n} with \\frac{v_{n}}{||v_{n}||}.
