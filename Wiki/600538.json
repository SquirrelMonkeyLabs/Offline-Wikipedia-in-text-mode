 "text": "Fernando de Szyszlo Valdelomar (5 July 1925 – 9 October 2017) was a Peruvian painter, sculptor, printmaker, and teacher. He was a key figure in advancing abstract art in Latin America since the mid-1950s, and one of the leading plastic artists in Peru. Szyszlo became a major force for artistic renewal in his country breaking new ground by expressing a Peruvian subject matter in a non-representational style. In 1962, he became a professor of art at Cornell University. In 1965 he became a visiting lecturer at Yale University. Szyszlo was awarded the Order of the Sun of Peru in 2011. Szyszlo died of complications from a fall at his home in Lima, Peru on 9 October 2017 at the age of 92.Fernando de Szyszlo: falleció el destacado artista plástico a los 92 años ==References== ==Other websites== *Fernando de Szyszlo on Artnet *Fernando de Szyszlo at MLA Gallery, Los Angeles *Fernando de Szyszlo at Anita Shapolsky Gallery, New York * Fernando de Szyszlo at Mixografia, Los Angeles Category:1925 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Peruvian painters Category:Sculptors Category:Peruvian academics Category:People from Lima",
