 "text": "The Hohes Licht is a mountain in the Allgäu Alps. It is high. It is the second highest in the Allgäu range after the Großer Krottenkopf. The summit is in Tyrol, Austria. Hohes Licht is 14km south of Oberstdorf. It was first climbed in 1854, and a \"survey signal\" was left on top for triangulation. On 6 August 1869 it was first climbed for leisure purposes by Hermann von Barth. When he arrived the signal was still there.Anton Spiehler in Eduard Richter: Erschliessung der Ostalpen, Ist Vol., Berlin, 1893, pp. 62 ff.
