 "text": "The Rossi Pavilion () is a pavilion on the near the Moyka River in the Mikhailovsky Garden in Saint Petersburg. It was designed by Carlo Rossi in the early 1820s. It was built in 1825, when the garden was being rebuilt. It was built where one of the palaces used to be. That was the Golden Mansion of Peter the Great's wife, Empress Catherine. The palace was removed on the orders of Catherine the Great in 1768. The pavillion was created in the Neoclassical style. It was built to give an area for recreation near the river with a pier where boats could moor. The pavilion went through the Soviet period. As part of this work, a bust of Carlo Rossi was placed in the pavilion. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Saint Petersburg",
