 "text": "The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the head of the United States House of Representatives. The Speaker is elected by the current members of the House. A person with more than half of the votes becomes Speaker. ==Duties== The Speaker has always been a member of the majority party (the party with the most members) but does not have to be an elected member of the House (this has not happened yet). The job of the Speaker is to keep the House in order and to assign committee memberships and chairmanships. It is an important and powerful position in government. ==Background== Sam Rayburn is the only person to have served as Speaker of the House for more than ten years. Theodore M. Pomeroy served as Speaker of the House for one day after Speaker Schuyler Colfax resigned to become Vice President of the United States; Pomeroy's term as a Member of Congress ended the next day. Sam Rayburn, Henry Clay, Thomas Brackett Reed, Joseph William Martin, Jr., Frederick Muhlenberg, John W. Taylor, and Nancy Pelosi are the only Speakers of the House to have ever served in non-consecutive Congresses (i.e. another Speaker served in between each tenure). ==Order of succession== The Speaker of the House is third in line for the Presidency of the United States. If the President of the United States dies or steps down, the Vice President of the United States becomes President. If there is no vice president, the Speaker of the House automatically becomes acting president. == List of speakers of the United States House of Representatives == It includes the congressional district and political affiliation of each speaker as well as the number of their Congress and time they spent in the position. # Speaker Party District Congress Tenure 1 Frederick Muhlenberg Pro-Administration 1st April 1, 1789 — March 4, 1791 2 Jonathan Trumbull, Jr. Pro-Administration 2nd October 24, 1791 — March 4, 1793 3 Frederick Muhlenberg Anti-Administration 3rd December 2, 1793 — March 4, 1795 4 Jonathan Dayton Federalist 4th December 7, 1795 — March 4, 1797 4 Jonathan Dayton Federalist 5th May 15, 1797 — March 4, 1799 5 Theodore Sedgwick Federalist 6th December 2, 1799 — March 4, 1801 6 Nathaniel Macon Democratic-Republican 7th December 7, 1801 — March 4, 1803 6 Nathaniel Macon Democratic-Republican 8th October 17, 1803 — March 4, 1805 6 Nathaniel Macon Democratic-Republican 9th December 2, 1805 — March 4, 1807 7 Joseph Bradley Varnum Democratic-Republican 10th October 26, 1807 — March 4, 1809 7 Joseph Bradley Varnum Democratic-Republican 11th May 22, 1809 — March 4, 1811 8 Henry Clay Democratic-Republican 12th November 4, 1811 — March 4, 1813 8 Henry Clay Democratic-Republican 13th May 24, 1813 — January 19, 1814 9 Langdon Cheves Democratic-Republican 13th January 19, 1814 — March 4, 1815 10 Henry Clay Democratic-Republican 14th December 4, 1815 — March 4, 1817 10 Henry Clay Democratic-Republican 15th December 1, 1817 — March 4, 1819 10 Henry Clay Democratic-Republican 16th December 6, 1819 — October 28, 1820 11 John W.

Most sources claim Representative Rainey presided over the House during an Indian appropriations debate in May 1874. See, for example, an early secondary work, Samuel Denny Smith, The Negro in Congress: 1870–1901 (Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press, Inc., 1940): 47–48. Most subsequent sources cite Smith. Yet the New York Herald published an article reporting that Rainey served as Speaker pro tempore on April 29; see “A Liberated Slave in the Speaker’s Chair,” 30 April 1874, New York Herald: 9. Similar accounts exist in the Baltimore Sun, the Charleston News and Courier, and the African-American newspaper The New National Era, though these reports cite April 29 and April 30. There is no mention of Rainey’s presiding in the Congressional Record or the House Journal for either date: Congressional Record, House, 43rd Cong., 1st sess. (29–30 April 1874): 3457–3476, 3490–3507; House Journal, 43rd Cong., 1st sess. (29–30 April 1874): 877–885. Joseph H. Rainey Republican 43rd May 13, 1874 31 James G.
