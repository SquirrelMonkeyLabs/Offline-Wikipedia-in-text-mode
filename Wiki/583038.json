 "text": "Medical marijuana, aka medical cannabis, is cannabis and cannabinoids that are given by doctors to their patients. The use of marijuana as a medicine has not been tested much because it can be difficult to get enough of it to test and because of other governmental regulations. Medical cannabis can help with nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy. It can improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS. It can reduce chronic pain and muscle spasms. Short-term use makes it more likely that there will be side effects. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness and hallucinations. Long-term effects of marijuana are not clear. Concerns include memory problems, risk of addiction and children taking it by accident. The Cannabis plant has been used as medicine for thousands of years in many cultures. Its current use is controversial. Medical marijuana can be given in different ways. They include vaporizing, smoking dried buds, eating foods that have cannabis in them, taking capsules or using lozenges. Recreational use of marijuana is illegal in most parts of the world. The medical use of cannabis is legal in some countries, including the Czech Republic, Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. Australia is working to pass a law that will allow the use of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. In the United States, federal law says all use of marijuana is illegal. But more than 30 states and the District of Columbia no longer arrest people for having medical marijuana, as long as they follow a state's medical marijuana rules. ==References== Category:Cannabis",
