 "text": "Samuel Holmes Sheppard ( â€“ ) was an American neurosurgeon and professional wrestler. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio. Sheppard was known for being accused and later convicted for murdering his wife Marilyn. He was released in 1966 after new evidence questioned his guilty sentence. The case was controversial from the beginning. The U.S. Supreme Court found that the \"carnival atmosphere\" (media) surrounding Sheppard's first trial had made due process impossible. After ten years in prison he was acquitted at a second trial. There was also evidence that he judge from Sheppard's first trial was unfair. Sheppard was represented by F. Lee Bailey. In August 1969 at the age of 45, he became a wrestler known as \"Killer\" Sam Sheppard. Sheppard wrestled over 40 matches before his death in April 1970. Sheppard died on April 6, 1970 of liver failure after suffering from alcoholism in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 46. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Deaths from liver failure Category:American people convicted of manslaughter Category:People acquitted of murder Category:American professional wrestlers Category:American physicians Category:Sportspeople from Cleveland Category:Neurosurgeons",
