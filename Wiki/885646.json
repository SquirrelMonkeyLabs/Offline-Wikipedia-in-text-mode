 "text": "An Israeli Jew is a Jew who lives in the state of Israel. Jews have been living in Israel ever since Moses led them to there. But over time they had been kicked out then let back. The modern term mostly refers to the Jews who moved to the Jewish holy land after the forming of the state in 1948. Israeli Jews live there because of Zionism in the 20th century.",
