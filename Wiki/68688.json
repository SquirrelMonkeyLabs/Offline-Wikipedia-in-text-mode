 "text": "The Hephthalites (Bactrian: ηβοδαλο, romanized: Ebodalo) sometimes called the White Huns (also known as the White Hunas, in Iranian as the Spet Xyon and in Prakrit as the Sveta-huna) were a people who lived in Central Asia during the 5th to 8th centuries CE, part of the larger group of Eastern Iranian Huns. They formed an empire, the Imperial Hephthalites, and were militarily important from 450 CE, when they defeated the Kidarites, to 560 CE, when combined forces from the First Turkic Khaganate and the Sasanian Empire defeated them. After 560 CE, they established \"principalities\" in the area of Tokharistan, under the suzerainty of the Western Turks (in the areas north of the Oxus) and of the Sasanian Empire (in the areas south of the Oxus), before the Tokhara Yabghus took over in 625. == References == == Further reading == :Note:These may not be written in Basic English. * Otto J.
