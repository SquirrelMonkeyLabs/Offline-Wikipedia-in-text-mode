Jon was voiced by Sandy Kenyon in the first animated television special (Here Comes Garfield), before Huge returned to the character in all later specials and in Garfield and Friends. Breckin Meyer portrayed Jon in the live-action/animated films Garfield: The Movie and Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties, and voiced him in the Robot Chicken parodies. In Garfield Gets Real, Garfield's Fun Fest and Garfield's Pet Force, he was voiced by Wally Wingert. Wally also provides Jon's voice for The Garfield Show. Nicholas Hoult voiced Jon in The Garfield Movie. * Similarly, Garfield Minus Garfield removes all the other characters completely and simply features Jon talking to himself. Fans connected with Jon's \"loneliness and desperation\" and found his \"crazy antics\" humorous; Jim Davis himself called Dan Walsh's (the author of Garfield Minus Garfield) strips an \"inspired thing to do\" and said that \"some of the strips work better than the originals\". * Jon has appeared in three Robot Chicken Sketches * == References == Category:Comics characters Category:Garfield",
