 "text": "Major League Baseball's drug policy prohibits players from using, having, selling, allowing the sale of, distributing, or allowing the distribution of any Drug of Abuse and/or Steroid. Any and all drugs or substances listed under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act are considered drugs of abuse covered by the Program. Players who require prescription medication can still use it with a \"Therapeutic Use Exemption\" granted by MLB. In December 2019, MLB removed cannabinoids and added cocaine and opiates to its list of Drugs of Abuse. However, players were told that they could still be suspended for possessing or selling cannabis, or driving under the influence of cannabis. ==List of banned substances (not exhaustive)== ===Drugs of abuse=== #
