 "text": "A relative clause is a string of words that contains a noun and a verb. Relative clauses can not stand on their own as a sentence but must begin with a relative pronoun. This is one of the most difficult aspects of English. Consider: *The bed I was lying on. (implies an answer to a previous question) *The bed that I was lying on... (implies a continuation) *The bed which I was lying on... (also implies a continuation) Consider these two sentences: (1) The builder, who erects very fine houses, will make a large profit. (non- restrictive) (2) The builder who erects very fine houses will make a large profit. (restrictive) On the first, he will make a large profit, and the sentence gives the reason. In the second, the profit comes only if he builds well. The profit is conditional upon his performance. Category:Grammar",
