Later he went to France, from where he returned to try to kill the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. On September 11 1926, in the Porta Pia square in Rome, he threw a bomb against Mussolini's car, but without effect. Arrested, Lucetti was condemned to spend his life in prison. In 1943, Lucetti escaped from prison with the help of others, but died shortly during a bombing of Ischia. ==Related pages== * List of anarchists ==References== * * * Marina Marini, Gino Lucetti.
