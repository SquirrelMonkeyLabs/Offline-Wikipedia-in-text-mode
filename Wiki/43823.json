 "text": "A boomerang is a flying tool that is best known for its ability to return to the thrower. In the past, it was made of wood, but most of the modern boomerangs are made of other materials. Despite being an Australian icon, ancient boomerangs have also been discovered elsewhere in Africa, the Americas, and Eurasia. ==History== Most people know that Australian Aborigines used boomerangs for hunting. But the oldest boomerang was found in a cave in Poland and is more than 20,000 (twenty thousand) years old. This kind of boomerang does not return to the thrower, but it can fly longer distances and more stably than other things which can be thrown. These days (returning) boomerangs are usually used for recreation. ==Technical aspects== Most of the boomerangs do not have the classical \"L\"-shape. The modern boomerang is special in that it will return to the one who threw it, if it is thrown correctly. However, some boomerangs do not return because their wings do not have the right profile. Most of the boomerangs are made for right-handed use. Left-handed people have to use other boomerangs that are mirror-inverted, or have to throw with their right hand. ==Throwing instructions== A boomerang is not thrown like a frisbee. It has to be thrown almost vertically, with an inclination of about 10–20 degrees and with a lot of rotation (spin). When facing the wind, throw with an angle of 30–45 degrees to the right (left- handed: to the left) of the wind. Be sure to choose a field that is big enough. Watch out for passers-by, and do not throw when people are standing in the range of the boomerang. See also the link provided in the section below. ==Clubs== There are a lot of boomerang clubs in many countries all over the world. These clubs organise workshops and tournaments. The best boomerang- throwers come from Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the United States of America. A few years ago, the International Federation of Boomerang Associations (IFBA) was founded to help to spread knowledge about boomerangs. ==Other websites== *Illustrated throwing instructions *International Federation of Boomerang Associations *United States Boomerang Association *British Boomerang Society Category:Tools Category:Weapons Category:Indigenous Australian culture",
