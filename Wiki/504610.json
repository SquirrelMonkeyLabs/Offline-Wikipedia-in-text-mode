Since Romania was part of the Eastern Bloc, TAROM had to fly mostly airplanes made by the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union ended in 1991, TAROM was allowed to buy airplanes from other countries. TAROM started flying Airbus planes in 1993. In 2010, TAROM joined SkyTeam. As of 2016, TAROM owns 23 airplanes and goes to 79 cities across Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. ==Gallery== File:Ilyushin Il-62M, Tarom AN0215749.jpg|A TAROM airplane at London Gatwick Airport File:TAROM Boeing 737-700; YR- BGG@ZRH;28.02.2010 565dq (4395178885).jpg|A special TAROM Boeing 737-700 File:YR-ASC A318 Tarom (9464420977).jpg|A Airbus A318 of TAROM in 2013 File:TAROMAirbusA 318 (2).JPG|The cabin of a TAROM airplane ==References== Category:1954 establishments in Europe Category:Airlines of Europe Category:Organizations based in Romania",
