Her mother, Sharman Macdonald, is Scottish. Her father, Will Knightley, is English. He wanted to name his daughter \"Kiera\", after the Russian ice skater, Kira Ivanova. When her mother went to register her, she misspelt the name. Knightley has an older brother, Caleb. When Knightley lived in Richmond, she studied at Stanley Junior School, Teddington School and Esher College. When Knightley was three years old, she asked to her parents to hire an agent for her. They promised to do this, if she studied very well. That's why Keira was a good and diligent pupil. == Movies == * Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999) * Princess of Thieves (2001) * The Hole (2001) * Bend It Like Beckham (2002) * Pure (2002) * New Year's Eve (2002) * Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) * Love Actually (2003) * King Arthur (2004) * The Jacket (2005) * Pride & Prejudice (2005) * Domino (2005) * Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) * Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) * Silk (2007) * Atonement (2007) * The Edge of Love (2008) * The Duchess (2008) * Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011) * The Nutcracker and the Four Realms (2018) == Other websites == * == References == Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from London Category:English movie actors Category:English television actors Category:People with dyslexia",
