 "text": "The Battle of Badr (), was fought March 13, 624 CE 17 Ramadan 2 AH in the Islamic calendar in the Hejaz of western Arabia (present-day Saudi Arabia). It was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca. The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory because of divine intervention. Also, it is attributed to the genius of Muhammad. Although it is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an, virtually all contemporary knowledge of the battle at Badr comes from traditional Islamic accounts, both hadiths and biographies of Muhammad, written decades after the battle. ==Related pages== * Battle of Uhud * Jihad * Islam == Footnotes == == References == === Books and articles === * * * * * * * === Online references === * * * * == Other websites == * Manaqib Ashab al-Badriyyin A prayer citing the virtues and exploits of the Muslims who took part in the battle. * Badr at IslamAnswers.Net * The Battle of Badr at Al-Islam.Org * The first battle of Islam at Badr : Islamic Occasions Network * Hope Springs Eternal A nice multimedia presentation at IslamOnline.Net * MSN Virtual Earth: A modern-day satellite image of Badr, now called \"Badr Hunayn\". * Tafsir (Sura 8: verse 11 to 18) - Battle of Badr: Analysis of Qur'anic verses by Irshaad Hussain.
