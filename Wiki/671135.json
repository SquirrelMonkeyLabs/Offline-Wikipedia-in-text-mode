(/ˈhwɑːˌweɪ/; Chinese: 华为; ) is a Chinese multinational telecommunications equipment and consumer electronics company based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, South China. It was founded by Ren Zhengfei in 1987. The name Huawei may be translated as \"splendid act\" or \"China is able\"; Hua can mean \"splendid\" or \"China\", while wei can mean \"action\" or \"achievement\". Huawei has had a lot of problems in some countries. They have mainly had problems with the United States government. The US government said that the Chinese government could use Huawei's 5G technology to spy on people. Because of this, the US government does not want other countries to use technology by Huawei or ZTE. In May 2019, the US government put Huawei on a blacklist. This meant that Huawei could not do business with American companies. == Smartphones == === Huawei P30 === Huawei P30 Pro was released on March 26, 2019, it has a 6.47 inch OLED display, 4200mAh battery capacity, Kirin 980 chipset, 32MP wide selfie camera, 40W wired charger and USB-C, it runs Android 9, Huawei P30 was released on March 26, 2019, It has a 6.1 inch OLED display, 3650mAh battery capacity, 32MP wide selfie camera and runs Android 9. === Huawei Mate 20 === Huawei Mate 20 was released on October 31, 2018.
