 "text": "Chögyam Trungpa (February 28, 1939 – April 4, 1987) was a Tibetan Buddhist teacher and meditation master known for bringing Tibetan Buddhism to the West. He was the 11th Trungpa Tulku, a key figure in the Kagyu lineage, and the founder of the Shambhala tradition. Trungpa escaped Tibet in 1959 after the Chinese invasion and later studied in the United Kingdom. He moved to North America in the 1970s, where he established meditation centers and founded Naropa University, a Buddhist-inspired institution in Colorado. Known for his unorthodox teaching methods, Trungpa emphasized \"crazy wisdom\" and direct engagement with students. He played a significant role in making Tibetan Buddhist teachings accessible to Western audiences, though his personal life—including his use of alcohol—remained controversial. His teachings continue to influence contemporary Buddhist practice through organizations such as Shambhala International. Category:1939 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Buddhist clergy",
