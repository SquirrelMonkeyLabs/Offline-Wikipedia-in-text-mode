 "text": "Presidential elections were held in Tunisia on 15 September 2019. No candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round, so a runoff was held on 13 October. Before the death of incumbent president Beji Caid Essebsi on 25 July, the elections had been planned for 17 and 24 November. However, as a result of Essebsi's death, the elections were brought forward in order to ensure that a new president would take office within 90 days, as required by the constitution. The elections were the second direct vote for the presidency since the 2011 revolution. Kaïs Saïed and Nabil Karoui were the two candidates who made it to the run off. In the run-off, Saïed won the election in a landslide victory. ==Results== Candidate Candidate Party First round First round Second round Second round Candidate Candidate Party Votes % Votes % Kaïs Saïed Independent 620,711 18.4 2,777,931 72.7 Nabil Karoui Heart of Tunisia 525,517 15.6 1,042,894 27.3 Abdelfattah Mourou Ennahda Movement 434,530 12.9 Abdelkrim Zbidi Independent 361,864 10.7 Youssef Chahed Long Live Tunisia 249,049 7.4 Safi Saïd Independent 239,951 7.1 Lotfi Mraihi Union of the Republican People 221,190 6.6 Seifeddine Makhlouf Dignity Coalition 147,351 4.4 Abir Moussi Free Destourian Party 135,461 4.0 Mohamed Abbou Democratic Current 122,287 3.6 Moncef Marzouki Al-Irada 100,338 3.0 Mehdi Jomaa Tunisian Alternative 61,371 1.8 Mongi Rahoui Popular Front 27,346 0.8 Hechmi Hamdi Current of Love 25,284 0.8 Hamma Hammami Independent 23,252 0.7 Elyes Fakhfakh Ettakatol 11,532 0.3 Saïd Aïdi Beni Watani 10,198 0.3 Omar Mansour Independent 10,160 0.3 Mohsen Marzouk Machrouu Tounes 7,376 0.2 Hamadi Jebali Independent 7,364 0.2 Néji Jalloul Independent 7,166 0.2 Abid Briki Tunisia Forward 5,799 0.2 Selma Elloumi Rekik Al Amal 5,094 0.2 Mohamed Esghaier Nouri Independent 4,598 0.1 Slim Riahi New National Union 4,472 0.1 Hatem Boulabiar Independent 3,704 0.1 Total Total Total 3,372,973 100.0 – Valid votes Valid votes Valid votes 3,372,973 97.3 – Blank votes Blank votes Blank votes 23,867 0.7 – Spoilt votes Spoilt votes Spoilt votes 68,344 2.0 – Turnout Turnout Turnout 3,465,184 49.0 Registered voters Registered voters Registered voters 7,074,566 Source: ISIE Source: ISIE Source: ISIE Source: ISIE Source: ISIE Source: ISIE Source: ISIE ==References== Category:2010s in Tunisia Category:2019 elections Category:September 2019 events Category:October 2019 events Category:Elections in Africa Category:2019 in Africa",
