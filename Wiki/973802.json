 "text": "Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai was a Rabbi from the Talmud. It’s said that when Rabbi Yehudah praised the Roman Empire for building good things, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai criticized the Romans saying that everything they did they only did to help themselves instead of the Jews while Rabbi Yossi said nothing. So the Romans exiled Rabbi Yossi, rewarded Rabbi Yehuda and sentenced Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai to death. To escape, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son went into exile and spent years in a cave learning Torah from Elijah. When it was safe for them to leave they left and when Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai saw Jewish farmers farming instead of studying Torah, he criticized them so the field caught on fire and a voice from heaven asked “Have you come out to destroy my world” and told Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son to go back to the cave. They did. One year later, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son left the cave and after speaking to the other Jews, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai praised them for how much they honoured the Sabbath. According to tradition, what Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai learned from Elijah eventually became the Zohar. Category:Rabbis",
