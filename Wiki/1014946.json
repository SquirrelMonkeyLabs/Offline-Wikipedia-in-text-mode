 "text": "A plane crash is an accident where an airplane crashes. Plane crashes can be minor with nobody getting hurt, or they can be severe and kill many people. The first plane crash involving a jet aircraft was British Overseas Airways flight 781, which was a De Havilland Comet that crashed on January 10th 1954, killing all 35 humans on board. The deadliest airplane incident in history was the Tenerife Airport Disaster where two Boeing 747 airplanes collided into each other on the 27th March 1977. One was a KLM plane and the other was a Pan Am airplane. The number of fatalities were 583 people dead, and 61 survivors. The deadliest single aircraft accident ever was Japan Airlines Flight 123, which crashed in Japan on the 12th August 1985, after an explosion that triggered a rapid decompression. Only 4 people survived, out of the 524 people on the plane. Still, safety improvements are being made on airplanes regularly to make sure no more crashes on planes happen. Pilots are also being trained to fight many different problems that might occur in their experience to know what to do if they happen.
