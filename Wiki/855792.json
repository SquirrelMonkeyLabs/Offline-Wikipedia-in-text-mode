 "text": "The Kooikerhondje (Dutch for \"small cager dog\") and sometimes known as the Dutch Spaniel, is a small spaniel-type of gundog that was first bred in the Netherlands. ==History== This dog was first bred in the Netherlands around the end of the 16th century and they appeared in paintings by some of the Dutch Masters. They were originally used to force ducks into traps. ==Colours== Usually these dogs are white with big patches of a red/orange colour. ==Temperament== The Kooikerhondje, like most spaniels, is a very energetic dog that needs plenty of exercise. The are mostly friendly and get along with children and other pets. However, as they are bred gundogs they will have instincts to hunt so care should be taken around pet birds especially. ==References== Category:Spaniels Category:FCI breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in the Netherlands Category:Rare dog breeds",
