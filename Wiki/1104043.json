 "text": "The Nongkhor Asian tree frog, Nongkhor pigmy tree frog, Nong Khor bush frog frog, or Nongkhor foam-nest tree frog (Chirixalus doriae) is a frog. It lives in India, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Laos. Scientists think it could live in China too. This frog can live in different kinds of places. People have seen it in forests, logging camps, usually near swamps or ponds. They see this frog between 78 and 1660 meters above sea level. The female frog finds a body of water that dries up for part of the year. She lays her eggs on leaves, on the side of the leaf facing the ground. The female frog watches the nest to stop other animals from eating the eggs. Scientists believe the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place and because it is good at living in places that humans have changed. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to make farms, especially for things to sell, for example, coffee, rubber, and tea. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Ulu Muda Forest reserve and Kon Ka Kinh National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
