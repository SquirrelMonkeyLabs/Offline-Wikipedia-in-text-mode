 "text": "The Ultra-Humanite is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, first appearing in Action Comics #13 (1939). He is a genius super- villain with the ability to transfer his mind into other bodies. This has made him an enemy to the Justice Society of America and Superman. His main claim to fame is his ability to transfer his own consciousness from one living body to another, but he also has invented a vast array of advanced weapons, vehicles, and other arcane technology. His chosen form is a giant albino mutant gorilla, which affords him incredible strength and durability. Ultra-Humanite has been a member of the Secret Society of Super-Villains and the Time Stealers.
