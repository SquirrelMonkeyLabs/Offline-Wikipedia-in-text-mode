 "text": "Dover MRT Station (EW22) is an MRT Station in Singapore. It is part of the East West MRT Line. The station was opened on 18 October 2001. It is the first MRT station to be built over an existing MRT line and hence it had 2 Side platforms instead of the normal Island platform. The station is near Singapore Polytechnic. The station code was W7A. In July 2001 it was changed to EW22. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations",
