 "text": "Kenneth James \"Kenny\" McCormick is a fictional character in the animated television series South Park. == Appearance == Kenny always wears an orange parka, which partially obscures his face. Kenny's voice is hard to understand because of his parka. This is done mainly because the things he says are usually vulgar, when compared to other characters. Even though his dialogue is not understood by the viewer, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman can understand him clearly. == Family == Kenny comes from a very poor family. He is the most cosmopolitan of the four boys. Kenny is close friends with Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, and Kyle Broflovski. The others often ask him to explain sexual terms they do not understand. == Dying == It was an on-going part during the earlier episodes of the series that Kenny dies in most of the episodes. His death is not permanent. He usually returned for the next episode but characters rarely talk about him having ever died. Kenny's face is always somewhat hidden by his parka or other things that can cover his face. In one episode in season five, Kenny dies from an illness and is not seen again for another season. During this time, the three boys look for a new fourth member. This included: Timmy Burch (briefly), and Tweek Tweak and Butters Stotch (who both shared the main role of fourth member). ==References== Category:South Park characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1992 Category:Fictional American people",
