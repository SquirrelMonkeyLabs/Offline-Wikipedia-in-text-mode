The birds are round, and do not have wings or feet. The pigs also have no feet and are all green. In the animated series and books, the characters have different personalities. ===The Flock (main birds)=== *Red is the angry leader of the flock. He likes taking care of the eggs. He does nothing but does make various battle cries when tapped and does great at popping pigs. In Angry Birds 2, his scream can push structures down. *The Blues (Jay, Jake, and Jim) are blue birds who are triplets. They love playing games and pulling pranks on others. In the games, they seem to appear as one bird. When the screen is tapped, they split into three smaller birds. They work best against glass. There is an animated series based on them called Angry Birds Blues. *Chuck is a yellow bird with a triangle body. He moves and acts fast, but he is very prideful. Chuck picks up speed and distance when tapped. His power works best against wood. *Bomb is a black bird that looks like a round bomb. When he feels strong emotions like anger, he explodes. In the games, he explodes when tapped or shortly upon impact. His explosions work the best against stone. *Matilda is a white bird who is sweet and friendly. She likes gardening and acts like a mother to the flock. In the games, she drops an egg bomb that explodes on impact when tapped and damages wood and stone the most. *Hal is a green toucan with a long beak. He is friendly and calm. Because of his beak, he comes back like a boomerang when tapped and damages wood and glass the most. *Terence is a large, dark red bird. He does not move or talk much, and mostly growls. He has no special abilities when tapped, but is heavy and destroys materials with ease. *Bubbles is an orange bird who was introduced in Angry Birds Seasons in the \"Ham'o'Ween\" update. He has lots of energy and loves eating candy on Halloween. He inflates to a huge size like a balloon when tapped or upon impact, then deflates a little later. He works best against wood. *Stella is a pink bird who was introduced in Angry Birds Seasons in the \"Back to School\" update. She is cheerful and bubbly, but she can get angry when somebody lets her down. In the old games, when tapped, she makes a bubble around her, and lifts up objects like blocks and pigs. The bubbles last for about 3 seconds. She had her own game and animated cartoon called Angry Birds Stella. In that game, she bounces off walls to attack. *Silver is a gray falcon who was introduced in Angry Birds 2 in 2015. She was raised by the pigs as a young bird. In the game, she loops in the sky and dives downwards. However, in The Angry Birds Movie 2, Silver is Chuck's sister who loves inventing. *Melody is a beige potoo introduced in Angry Birds 2 in 2022. She is calm and loves singing jazz music. She inhales nearby objects and spits them out. ===Stella's flock=== *Poppy is a light yellow cockatiel.

She loves doing experiments and inventing. *Gale is a purple bird who used to be Stella's friend. She left Stella's flock after she found a crown, and is seen as a queen by the pigs of Golden Island.

He is old and wise, but does not like being disturbed. He can appear by launching a can of sardines with the slingshot. When it hits the ground, he will cause an earthquake to defeat the pigs. In the original game, he must be purchased in- game for 99 cents to be used. He can be used for an unlimited number of times, except in Angry Birds Friends. In The Angry Birds Movie 2, he had an ex-wife named Zeta. *Zeta is the main villain of The Angry Birds Movie 2 and the leader of Eagle Island. She is a purple eagle who tries to destroy Bird Island and Piggy Island. *Ice Bird is an alien bird made of ice who appears in Angry Birds Space. He explodes and everything near him freezes to ice. This makes it easier for The Blues to destroy them. *Tony is Terence's cousin from Helsinki, Finland. They look almost the same, except Tony is light blue and has thicker feathers. He first appears in Angry Birds Seasons. *Jo is a turquoise and black bird-of-paradise who loves dancing.

This caused mass outrage among the fanbase, who started a campaign called \"#BringBack2012\". Rovio responded by saying that the reason was because newer devices could not play the older games. On March 31, 2022, a remade version of the original called Rovio Classics: Angry Birds was released for the App Store and Google Play. The Android version was removed in February 2023 and the iOS version was renamed to Red's First Flight. == Related pages == *Amazing Alex *Bad Piggies ==References== Category:Sega franchises Category:Video game series",
