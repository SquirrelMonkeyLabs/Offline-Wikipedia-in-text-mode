 "text": "Yā Sīn (also pronounced as Yaseen; Arabic: يٰسٓ, yāsīn; the letters 'Yā and 'Sīn') is the 36th chapter of the Quran. It has 83 verses (āyāt). It is considered an earlier \"Meccan surah\". Some scholars sustain that verse 12 is from the Medinan period. While the surah begins in Juz' 22, most of it is in Juz' 23. The surah starts with the eponymous (muqatta'at) Arabic letters: يس (yā sīn). The meaning of the letters yā sīn, while being primarily unknown, is discussed amongst Muslim religious academics. == References == Category:Chapters in the Quran",
