 "text": "On 5 November 2021, a fuel tanker crashed with another truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone. This caused an explosion that killed at least 144 people. It also injured over 100 people. Reports state that a bus full of people were \"completely\" burnt and nearby shops and markets caught fire after fuel spilled over the streets. The crash provided a major challenge for Freetown's health service already creaking from years of underfunding. The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic gutted the country's ranks of medical staff, 250 of whom died, and the system has not recovered. ==References== Category:2021 disasters in Africa Category:2021 fires Category:Explosions in 2021 Category:2020s explosions in Africa Category:November 2021 events Category:History of Sierra Leone",
