 "text": "An emblem is a pictorial image either abstract or representational. It represents a Armorial of sovereign states concept — for example, a moral truth, or an allegory — or a person, such as a king or saint. For example, the scallop shell is the traditional emblem of James, son of Zebedee. Pilgrims wore it on their hat or clothes to show that they were travelling to the shrine at Santiago de Compostela. ==Military Emblems== File:148th Fighter Wing.png File:1st Reconnaissance Squadron.jpg File:95th Reconnaissance Squadron.png File:383d Fighter Squadron - Emblem - World War II.png|383d Fighter Sq File:384th Fighter Squadron - World War II - Emblem.png|384th Fighter Sq ==Related pages== * Coat of arms * Crest * Emblem book * Meme * Mission patch * National emblem * Saint symbology * Seal (emblem) * Symbol * Badge ==References== ==Further reading== * Emblematica Online.
