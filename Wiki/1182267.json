 "text": "A skeletal formula is a way of drawing a molecule of an organic compound. They are simplified versions of structural formulas that do not show most carbon or hydrogen atoms. Like a structural formula, chemical bonds are drawn as lines. Corners between lines show carbon atoms, replacing the C symbol used in structural formulas. Bonds between carbon and hydrogen are left out unless something specific about them matters (such as their stereochemistry). Category:Chemistry",
