 "text": "Nevermore is the second or third studio album by Norwegian singer Marion Raven preceding the debut album Here I Am and/or Set Me Free depending on the country. The album was recorded in Los Angeles over the course of two years, between 2008 and 2009, with composer and producer Oliver Leiber. Unfortunately, due to Eleven Seven Music dissolving their publishing arm, 'Five Ninteen Productions', the album was put 'on hold' while another imprint was found: eventually Eleven Seven partnered with EMI and Universal Music for Canada and Japan, but other disruptions such as Raven's involvement as a judge on The X Factor 's Norwegian edition, led to the album's inevitable cancellation in late 2010. The album only released two singles, \"Flesh and Bone\" and \"Found Someone,\" neither of which had a music video to promote them and were only released through iTunes Norway in the Scandinavian country.Marion released the album Songs from a Blackbird as a replacement for the one that never saw the light of day: Songs from a Blackbird was released in 2013 in Norway, and would be re-released in August 2014 by EPIC Records internationally with a different tracklisting.",
