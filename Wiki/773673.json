 "text": "The montane Pinocchio frog (Litoria vivissimia) is a frog from the island of New Guinea. Scientists saw it on Hides Ridge in the Southern Fold Mountains in Papua New Guinea. Like the Pinocchio frog, it has a point on its nose that can grow or shrink. The male adult frog is about 28.6 mm long from nose to rear end. It is light yellow-brown in color with light green patches and more yellow on its legs. It has a spike on its nose, and all of its toes are webbed. As of 2019, scientists only saw Litoria vivissimia once, in Central Cordillera. The scientists used DNA barcoding to examine Litoria vivissimia and its relatives, the parachuting frog and the Pinocchio frog. The Latin name of this frog, vivissimia, means \"cheeky monkey.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
