His father wanted him to work on iron but he decided to become a doctor instead. Prichard wrote a book called “Researches into the Physical History of Man”. In 1845, he was put in charge of several Insane asylums as a “Commissioner of lunacy.” Three years later, he died. == Psychiatry == Pritchard came up with the theory of Moral Insanity which said that there were some people who were sane but had no conscience. He called these people “morally insane”. Category:Psychiatrists",
