 "text": "== Leigh Hunt (1784–1859): A Simple Overview == James Henry Leigh Hunt, born on October 19, 1784, was an English poet, essayist, and critic. He was best known for his sharp opinions, his work in newspapers, and his friendships with famous poets like Keats and Shelley. \\---- == Early Life and Family == Leigh Hunt was born in Southgate, London. His parents had moved from the U.S. to England because they supported the British side during the American War of Independence. His father, Isaac Hunt, was once a lawyer and preacher. He named Leigh after a boy he tutored for a rich nobleman. Hunt went to Christ’s Hospital school in London, where he became friends with other future writers. He loved poetry from a young age and wrote verses copying poets like Thomas Gray. A speech problem kept him from going to university, but he kept reading and writing poetry. \\---- == Marriage and Children == In 1809, Hunt married Marianne Kent. They had ten children together. Marianne was often sick, and her sister Elizabeth helped Hunt with his writing. \\---- == Career in Journalism == === The Examiner (1808–1821) === Hunt became editor of a newspaper called The Examiner, which he started with his brother John. The paper was known for criticizing the government and the royal family. In 1813, Hunt was sent to prison for two years for insulting the Prince Regent by calling him fat. He was allowed visitors and decorated his jail cell like a cozy home. Many famous people, like Lord Byron and Charles Lamb, came to see him. === Other Publications === * The Reflector: A short-lived magazine where Hunt wrote satire and essays. * The Indicator: A weekly paper full of essays, stories, and poems. * The Companion: Another short-lived weekly, discussing books and plays. \\---- == Poetry and Writing == Hunt wrote poems like \"The Story of Rimini\", based on a tragic love story from Dante. He preferred older styles of poetry and often used humor or an easygoing tone. Famous poems by Hunt include: * \"Jenny kiss’d Me\" * \"Abou Ben Adhem\" * \"A Night-Rain in Summer\" He helped introduce poets like Keats, Shelley, Tennyson, and Browning to the public and formed a group of writers called the Hunt Circle, sometimes mockingly called the Cockney School. \\---- == Friendships with Keats and Shelley == Hunt was close friends with both Keats and Shelley. Shelley helped him financially, and Hunt supported Shelley in the press. He introduced the two poets to each other and wrote positively about them. \\---- == Trip to Italy == In 1821, Hunt traveled to Italy to join Shelley and Byron on a new magazine project. Sadly, Shelley died just after Hunt arrived. Hunt attended Shelley’s funeral, which was later shown in a famous painting. Hunt found it hard to work with Byron and was not welcomed by Byron's friends. After a few issues, the magazine ended. Hunt stayed in Italy until 1825. \\---- == Return to England == Back in England, Hunt published \"Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries\" in 1828, where he criticized Byron. Many people were upset because Byron had once helped him. Hunt struggled with money and poor health for much of his life. Some of his later newspapers and magazines failed despite good writing. However, in the 1830s and 1840s, Hunt began publishing books of poetry and essays that received more praise. His play \"Legend of Florence\" was a success in 1840. \\---- == Later Years and Death == In his later years, Hunt received a pension from the government and a small yearly payment from Mary Shelley (Shelley's widow). These helped him live more comfortably. He wrote several books: * Imagination and Fancy * Wit and Humour * A Jar of Honey from Mount Hybla * Autobiography (1850) He died in 1859 in London and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. \\---- == Leigh Hunt in Literature == Charles Dickens based the character Harold Skimpole in Bleak House on Hunt. Some critics thought the character was an unfair or exaggerated version of Hunt, but Dickens said it was based closely on reality. \\---- == Other Works == Hunt wrote and translated many other pieces, including: * Amyntas (from Italian) * Stories from the Italian Poets * Selections from English Dramatists * The Book of the Sonnet His sister-in-law, Elizabeth Kent, also used Hunt’s ideas in her gardening book Flora Domestica. \\---- == Legacy == Leigh Hunt is remembered as: * A key figure in Romantic literature * A courageous journalist who stood up to government power * A supporter and friend of major poets * A writer who helped shape literary taste in the 19th century Places named after him include a house at Christ’s Hospital school and Leigh Hunt Drive in Southgate, London.",
