 "text": "An enthronement is a ceremony of inauguration, involving a person —usually a monarch or religious leader — who is formally seated for the first time upon a throne. The throne is seen as a symbol of authority. This ritual is different from a coronation because there is no crown. However, the term \"coronation\" and the term \"enthronement\" are often used to mean the same thing. Category:Ceremonies",
