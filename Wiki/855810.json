 "text": "Modern English (ME) or New English (NE) is the type of English language spoken since the end of the 17th century after the Great Vowel Shift had completed. It evolved from Early Modern English, spoken mostly by the British people very long ago. With some differences in vocabulary, early important texts include Shakespeare’s works and the King James Bible were in Modern English. Because of colonization, English was used in many parts of the world by the British Empire, such as North America, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Modern English has many dialects spoken in many countries also known as the “English-speaking world”. These dialects are American, Australian, British (Anglo-English, Scottish English and Welsh English), Canadian, Caribbean, Irish English, Indian, Sri Lankan, Pakistani, Nigerian, New Zealand, Philippine, Singaporean, South African English and many more. == Related pages == * History of England * History of the United Kingdom == References == Category:English language",
