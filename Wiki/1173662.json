 "text": "Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) is an American news agency, which mainly covers Jewish and Israel-related news. ==Overview== The JNS is seen by some as a rival to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) – also based in the United States. ==History== The JNS was founded in September 2011, with an exclusive American distribution deal with free Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom. On February 12, 2025, the JNS started a multimedia center, with studio facilities for broadcasting podcasts. JNS's editor-in-chief is American journalist Jonathan S. Tobin. ==Reception== Left-wing journalists described the JNS as conservative – under the American political spectrum. They called the JNS \"hawkish\". They also accused the JNS of \"getting paid by right-wingers\". Meanwhile, JNS's owners said in 2014 that their main goal was to combat antisemitism, which had become common again 70 years following the end of the Holocaust. ==Other websites== * Jewish News Syndicate ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Newspapers in the United States",
