 "text": "Heaven & Hell was a British-American heavy metal supergroup. The band was made by Black Sabbath members Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, as well as Dio members Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice. The band's name is from the first Black Sabbath album with Ronnie James Dio on it, Heaven & Hell. The four members of Heaven & Hell had been making music and playing live shows as Black Sabbath since 1980. When they went on tour in 2007, they renamed themselves Heaven & Hell. Iommi stated that the fans would probably expect Ozzy Era songs, and he did not want fans to be confused and expect songs like Iron Man, War Pigs, Paranoid, etc. The band ended after Dio died from stomach cancer in 2010. == References == Category:Heavy metal bands Category:Musical groups established in 2006 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2010",
