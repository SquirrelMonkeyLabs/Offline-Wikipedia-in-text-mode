It was made by the African Union and was agreed upon in 2001 at a meeting of African leaders in Zambia. The goal of NEPAD is to help African countries become more successful by working together and helping each other.https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp0369.pdf == Function == The main goals of NEPAD are: to get rid of poverty, to help African countries grow and develop in a healthy way, to help Africa join the global economy, and to give women more power. NEPAD is based on the idea that African countries should have good leaders, fair governments, and respect for human rights. These are important for creating a place where it is safe to invest money and where the economy can grow over time. NEPAD works to get more money and investment from other countries to help Africa grow and develop. == Partners == * United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) * African Development Bank * Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) * Investment Climate Facility (ICF)http://unis.unvienna.org/pdf/MDG_Africa_NEPAD.pdf * African Capacity Building Foundation * Office of the UN Under-Secretary- General and Special Adviser on Africa == References == Category:Organizations based in Africa",
