Its origin is possibly Veracruz. Its name comes from the verb machacar (\"to mash\") because of its original preparation being crushed in a mortar. It can be used to accompany pozole, tacos, carne asada, fish, quesadillas, chamorro, botanas, etc. == References == Category:Mexican sauces Category:Condiments",
