 "text": "The Statue of Freedom is a statue of a woman that is on top of the United States Capitol. It was made in 1863 by Thomas Crawford. The woman is a symbol - she was not an actual person but stands for the idea of freedom. She is holding a shield and a laurel wreath in one hand. In the other hand, she is holding a sword that is sheathed (in its case). The statue stands on the peak of the dome, beckoning ideas and statutes that will be for the good of America and humanity.
