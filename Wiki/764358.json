 "text": "Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is a 2D platform game published by Sega. It is a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series and a direct sequel to Sonic & Knuckles (1994). The game was split into two episodes. The first episode, Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I, released in October 2010. The second episode, Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II, released in May 2012. ==Gameplay== Sonic 4 tries to mimic how the original games on the Sega Genesis were, while also adding new elements such as the Homing Attack from the 3D games like Sonic Adventure (1999). Because it was built from the ground up, Sonic's controls and acceleration are not exact. This results in glitches such as being able to slowly walk up walls. In Episode II, Tails is introduced. He acts the same as in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), except now he has upgraded abilities called Tag Actions he uses to help Sonic; the flying mechanic returns but has a smaller time limit, and a new ability where the two form a ball and roll forwards is also present. ==Development== The game was originally titled Project Needlemouse during development. One of Episode I main selling points announced early on was that Sonic was the only character in the game. ==Reception== ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * *Official website for Episode I *Official website for Episode II Category:2010 video games Category:2012 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Sega video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games en:Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I",
