The most common type of aerogel is silica aerogel, which is made from the same molecule as glass. It is a solid material that is almost as light as air. It is the world's lightest material.Quick, Darren (March 24, 2013). Graphene aerogel takes worldâ€™s lightest material crown . gizmag.com Its melting point is 1200 degrees Celsius, which is comparable to crocidolite asbestos. Aerogel is the best thermal insulator available and can be used in construction in place of fiberglass insulation. It allows better insulation with less material, although it is much more expensive than fiberglass. It is also brittle, making it more difficult to install than fiberglass. Most aerogel is not water- resistant, and even small amounts of water can destroy it. It is also safer than fiberglass or asbestos because it is not known to cause cancer if inhaled into the lungs.Cryogel 5201, 10201 Safety Data Sheet . Aspen Aerogels. 11/13/07 Some aerogel insulation, however, contains fiberglass to increase its flexibility. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Insulation Category:Synthetic materials",
