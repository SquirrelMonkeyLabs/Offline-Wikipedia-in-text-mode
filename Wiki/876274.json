 "text": "Campbell County, Georgia was a county in the U.S. state of Georgia that existed between 1828 and 1931. The county's capital was initially Campbellton, however due to the town's residents not allowing a railroad to be built, it was changed to Fairburn in 1870. In 1931, Campbell County was merged with Fulton County after the county went bankrupt during the Great Depression. Milton County, located 50 miles to the north, suffered the same fate.
