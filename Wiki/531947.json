 "text": "Viggo Reinholdt Rivad (3 July 1922 – 8 February 2016) was a Danish photographer. His career began in 1946, and he went on to win many competitions in the 1950s and 1960s. He was born in Nørrebro, Denmark. Around 1960, he adopted his so-called \"essay approach\". The essay approach uses a series of photographs to tell a story. This resulted in a series of related photographs such as \"Et farvel\" (1962) and \"Laurits\" (1971). Rivad also earned a living as a taxi driver. He was a quiet, dedicated photographer, concentrating on disadvantaged areas and people on the edges of society. His humanitarian messages were a result of his anger and concern for society's outcasts.\"Viggo Rivad\". From Den store Danske. Retrieved 18 February 2010. Rivad died in Copenhagen, Denmark of complications from a stroke on 8 February 2016. He was 93 years old. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Danish artists Category:Photographers",
