 "text": "Hakarp's church is a building in the Hakarp area of the Växjö district. It serves as the main church for the Hakarp community in Huskvarna. The church is in the village of Hakarp and is a pink cross church built in 1694. Before this stone church, there were two earlier churches: a wooden stave church from the 12th century and another made of logs from around 1283. The wooden church from the 13th century was taken down when the current stone church was built. The new church has a crucifix that is thought to have been in the church since the first one was made. In 1694, when they were going to build the stone church, the church members collected money during Easter. But this money wasn't enough for the new church, so General Customs Inspector Nils Arvidsson Hägerflycht paid for it. Hägerflycht hired Johan Olsson Ståhle as the supervisor, and Erik Dahlbergh may have been the architect. Hägerflycht spent 6,000 dal in copper coins for the church and 1,700 dal for the organ and other items. Like the rest of Sweden in the 19th century, many church items were painted white, but this was taken off during the church's 200th anniversary in 1894. Since 2014, Hakarp's parish is included in the Huskvarna church group. == Other websites == * Category:Churches in Sweden",
