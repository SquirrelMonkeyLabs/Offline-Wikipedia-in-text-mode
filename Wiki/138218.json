He is credited with being the first recorded skater to land the 900, which consists of two-and-a-half rotations (900Â°) in the air before landing back on the pipe during the televised June 27, 1999 X Games, for which he received an enormous amount of attention. He is also known for his Tony Hawk's video game series. In July 2021, Hawk briefly ended his competitive retirement to participate in the Vert Best Trick event at that year's X Games, finishing in fourth place out of nine competitors. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website * * Category:1968 births Category:Actors from San Diego Category:American movie actors Category:Philanthropists from California Category:American skateboarders Category:American television actors Category:Businesspeople from California Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from San Diego",
