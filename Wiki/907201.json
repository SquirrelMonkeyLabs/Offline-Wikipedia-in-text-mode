Its footage was used in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. ==Plot== Eight thousand years ago, the Daos civilization flourished in Southern China. The civilization consisted of three separate tribes: the Dai, the Buddhism (the ancestors of today's humanity) and the Gorma (the military tribe); which lived in harmony. However, one day, the Gorma Tribe decided to take over the Daos civilization and the world, beginning the war between the Gorma and Dai tribes. The war between the Gorma, led by the Gorma Triumvarate, and the Dai continued for 5,000 years until the Mythical Qi Beasts appeared to oppose the Gorma, whose Qi powers had increased to the point that they could turn themselves into monsters. Five Dai Warriors' Qi powers had increased to the point where they could control the Mythical Qi Beasts. The war ended with the disappearance of both the Dai and Gorma tribes and the Shura scattered around the world. In the present day, the Gorma tribe, one of the Daos' two missing branches, arose to take over the world. To counter them, Master Kaku assembled a team of five youths with high levels of Qi, who became the Dairangers. ==Characters== ===Dairanger=== Actor Name Rangers Mecha Keiichi Wada Ryo of Heavenly Fire Star Ryu Ranger Dragon Tatsuya Nomi Daigo of Heavenly Illusion Star Shishi Ranger Lion Ei Hamura Shouji of Heavenly Gravity Star Tenma Ranger Pegasus Keisuke Tsuchiya Kazu of Heavenly Time Star Kirin Ranger Kirin Natsuki Takahashi Rin of Heavenly Wind Star Hohou Ranger Phoenix Hisashi Sakai Kou of Howling New Star Kiba Ranger Byakko ==Cast== * Ryo of Heavenly Fire Star / Ryu Ranger: Keiichi Wada * Daigo of Heavenly Illusion Star / Shishi Ranger: Tatsuya Nōmi * Shouji of Heavenly Gravity Star / Tenma Ranger: Ei Hamura * Kazu of Heavenly Time Star / Kirin Ranger: Keisuke Tsuchiya * Rin of Heavenly Wind Star / Hohou Ranger: Natsuki Takahashi * Kou of Howling New Star / Kiba Ranger: Hisashi Sakai * Kazu's clone: Daisuke Tsuchiya * Master Kaku: Koji Naka ==Songs== ;Opening theme * Gosei Sentai Dairanger **Lyrics: Saburo Yatsude **Composition: Katsuo Ono **Arrangement: Kenji Yamamoto **Artist: New JACK Takurō aka Hirokazu Umeda ;Ending theme * We're Invincible!!
