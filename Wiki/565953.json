It was certified gold by the RIAA in 2017 for shipments of 500,000 copies in the US. == Critical reception == When reviewing 25, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy wrote that Adele and Kurstin \"strike upon a shimmering mid-tempo pop parade, as the London singer proclaims 'if you're gonna let me down, let me down gently' over the chewiest melody she's laid her vocals on. [â€¦] Adele's perceptive lyric and rich vocal makes it entirely her own.\" ==References== Category:2016 songs Category:Adele songs",
