 "text": "A heat wave is a period of unusually warm or very hot weather, and may be accompanied by high humidity. \"Heat wave\" is not an exact term: Any weather that feels warmer than people expect, might be called a heat wave. For example, temperatures normal for a warmer climate might be called a \"heat wave\" by people living in a place that is usually cooler. So a \"heat wave\" could mean a little warm weather, (like \"several days as hot as summer, but in winter\"), or temperatures so high they make history, (such as, \"the hottest summer in a hundred years\"). == Related pages == * List of heat waves ==References== ==Other websites== * FEMA: Extreme Heat * Hot Weather Tips * Marble Bar heatwave, 1923-1924 Category:Weather",
