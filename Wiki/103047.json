 "text": "The Sassanid Empire, or Sassanian Dynasty, [] is the the Persian dynasty that lasted from 224 to 651 AD.Wiesehofer, Joseph 1996. Ancient Persia. New York: I.B. Taurus The Sassanid Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the two great powers in Western Asia, alongside the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire, for more than 400 years. == King of kings == The Sassanid dynasty was founded by Ardashir I when he defeated the last Parthian (Arsacid) king, Artabanus IV, and ended when the last Sassanid Shahanshah (King of Kings), Yazdegerd III (632–651), lost a fourteen-year struggle to drive out the early Arab Caliphate, the first of the Islamic empires. The Sassanid Empire's traditional territory included what are now Iran, Iraq, Armenia, Afghanistan, Egypt and eastern Turkey and parts of Syria, Pakistan, Caucasia, Central Asia and Arabia. The Sassanid era is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran. In many ways; the Sassanid Empire saw the highest achievement of Persian civilization and was the last great Persian empire before the Muslim conquest and the adoption of Islam. Sassanid Persia influenced the Roman Epmire considerably,Bury J.B. 1923. History of the later Roman Empire. Macmillan, London.p109 and the Romans reserved for the Sassanid Persians the status of equals. The Roman Emperor wrote letters to the Persian Shahanshah, which were addressed to \"my brother\". The Sassanids' cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders by reaching as far as Western Europe,Durant, Will The story of civilization, 4: The Age of faith. New York: Simon and Schuster. Africa,Transoxiana 04: Sasanians in Africa China and India and played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic mediaeval art.Iransaga: The art of Sassanians This influence carried forward to the early Islamic world. The Sassanids' unique aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest of Iran into a Persian renaissance. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing and other skills were borrowed from the Sassanids and spread throughout the broader Muslim world. == Religion == The Sassanids began making the empire more Iranian after the fall of the Parthians by implementing and promoting Zoroastrianism in their kingdom. Zoroastrianism was the backbone and state religion of the Sassanid Empire. It was one of the first monotheistic religions and so the Sassanids believed in one god. The traditional Zoroastrian scripture, Avesta, was originally orally preserved in Avestan, a now-extinct language. However, the Sassanids were the first people to write the Avesta down wrote did so in an Aramaic script. In addition, many of the those who did not follow the Zoroastrianism faith were persecuted by the government. == Decline == In the spring of 632, a grandson of Khosrau I, Yazdegerd III, who had lived in hiding, ascended the throne. The same year, the first raiders from the Arab tribes made their raids into Persian territory and were united by Islam. Years of warfare had exhausted both the Byzantines and the Persians. Also, the latter were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation, religious unrest, rigid social classes, the increasing power of the provincial landholders and a rapid turnover of rulers. Those factors made the Islamic conquest of Persia easier than if it had been attempted earlier. The Sassanids never mounted a truly effective resistance to the pressure that was applied by the Muslim conquests. == Chronology == 226–241: Reign of Ardashir I: * 224–226: Overthrow of the Parthian Empire. * 229–232: War with Rome. * Zoroastrianism is revived as official religion. * The collection of texts known as the Zend Avesta is assembled. 241–271: Reign of Shapur I: * 241–244: War with Rome. * 252–261: War with Rome.
