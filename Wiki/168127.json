 "text": "Nocturnal emissions, wet dreams, sex dreams, and sleep orgasms all mean when person has a sexual orgasm while sleeping. It often leads to ejaculation. Wet dreams can begin after a person goes through puberty. Some young people have their first orgasm this way. According to one book, about 13% of boys had their first ejaculation through a wet dream. They might not understand what has happened to them, if they have not been taught anything about sex. Nocturnal emissions are called wet dreams in males because of the dampness caused by ejaculation and because the orgasm and ejaculation often happen during a sexually exciting dream. Scientists are not sure what causes them. Most sexual dreams do not cause orgasms. It is harder for women to tell, because vaginal lubrication is not always associated with orgasm. Wet dreams are natural and harmless. They do not mean that anything is wrong with you. While it can feel almost magical to ejaculate during a dream, most boys don't like the mess it creates. Many people stop having wet dreams if they masturbate often, or once they begin having sexual intercourse regularly. Dreams can be strange and confusing. Often it is best not to over-think about what they might mean. A dream about having sex with another boy or man does not necessarily mean you are gay. A sexual dream involving a relative or teacher does not mean you truly want to have sex with that person. A dream about sex with an animal does not mean you truly want to have sex with an animal. If you urinate while asleep, this is called wetting the bed, not a wet dream. Nocturnal emissions are mentioned in the bible in Deuteronomy 23:10 and Leviticus 15:16. Deuteronomy 23:10-11 says, \"10: If any man among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp and stay outside. 11: When evening approaches, he must wash with water, and when the sun sets he may return to the camp.\" (Berean Standard Bible) ==References== Category:Sleep",
