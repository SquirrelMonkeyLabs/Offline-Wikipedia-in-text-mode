 "text": "A purma is a type of grassy place or forest in the Amazon Basin. It is a type of forest that has been cut down and is growing back. There are purmas in South America. Sometimes people cut down Amazon forest to make a farm. These farms are called chacras. After people stop using the farm, the trees and other plants start to grow back. Then it becomes a purma. Scientists call purma \"early successional forest.\" This means that a forest is only a purma for part of the time it is growing back. ==References== Category:Habitats Category:Forests",
