 "text": "ARM architecture is a computer CPU architecture used in computers of all sizes up to supercomputers; commonly used in embedded systems and mobile devices such as cell phones, tablet computers, and handheld game consoles such as the Game Boy Advance. ARM CPUs use very little electricity and produce very little heat. Most ARM CPUs run on battery power and don't need a cooling fan. The Linux operating system is used most on ARM CPUs. In 2013 ARM was the world's most popular 32-bit CPU architecture. Since then, production has increased to millions per day. 64-bit ARM, which allows for addressing memory greater than 3.8GB, has been available since then and is used in most modern smartphones. == Brands and Manufacturers == * Qualcomm Snapdragon * Samsung * Texas Instruments * Intel * MediaTek == Examples of products that use ARM == * Supercomputers including the top one, Fugaku, from 2020 to May 2022 * Most Android devices * Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad * Samsung Chromebook * Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch * Windows RT and Windows Phone * Many Wi-Fi routers and other network equipment * Digital cameras * DVD and Blu-ray players * Some newer televisions * Some car stereos * Raspberry Pi, a small form computer the size of a credit card == Related pages == * Z80 * X86 * Intel Atom * MIPS architecture Category:Computer processors Category:ARM-based processors",
