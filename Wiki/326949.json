 "text": "Sleeping Beauty (1959) is an American-French animated movie produced by Walt Disney Productions and released to movie theaters by Buena Vista Distribution. It is based on the 1697 fairy tale \"The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood\" by Charles Perrault. The movie was directed by Les Clark, Eric Larson, and Wolfgang Reitherman, under the supervision of Clyde Geronimi. Additional story work was provided by Joe Rinaldi, Winston Hibler, Bill Peet, Ted Sears, Ralph Wright, and Milt Banta. The movie's musical score and songs are arrangements or adaptations of material from the 1890 Sleeping Beauty ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Buena Vista Distribution released the movie to theaters on November 11, 1959. It was the first animated movie to be photographed in the Technirama widescreen process. The movie was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements. == Reception == The movie generated mixed reviews from critics. They thought the movie was slow- paced and lacked character development. Sleeping Beauty earned approximately $7.7 million in box office rentals. Its production costs totaled $6 million, making it the most expensive Disney movie to that date. The high production costs of the movie resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and many animators were fired. Even though it failed when it first came out, it made a lot of money during re-releases. After inflation, itâ€™s the seventh highest grossing animated movie. == References == Category:1959 movies Category:Disney animated movies Category:1950s English-language movies Category:American family movies Category:Movies composed by George Bruns Category:Sleeping Beauty Category:Movies based on fairy tales Category:1950s American drama movies Category:1950s American musical fantasy movies Category:1950s American romance movies Category:Movies about witchcraft Category:Movies about death Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies set in forests Category:Movies set in castles Category:Movies set in Europe Category:Movies directed by Clyde Geronimi Category:Movies directed by Wolfgang Reitherman",
