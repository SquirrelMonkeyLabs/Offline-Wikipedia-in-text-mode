 "text": "A J-card is a paper in a audio cassette case or sometimes with Blu-ray and DVD cases. It has the album's picture, song list, who made it, and copyright info. Some J-cards fold out to show words of the songs, notes, or more pictures. The J-card has the name on its side, so you can see what it is when you look at it on a shelf. The name \"J-card\" is because it looks like the letter \"J\" when you fold it and put it in the cassette case. People also use \"J-card\" for the paper covers of CD-Rs. In the 1990s, CDs, mainly single-song CDs, had J-cards. This style is still used today. == Other websites == * The Legendary Web J-Card Polygizmo Category:Audio technology",
