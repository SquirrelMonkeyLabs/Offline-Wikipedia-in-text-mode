 "text": "Afrikaners are white South Africans who speak Afrikaans as mother tongue and follow the Afrikaans culture. Most of them have Dutch ancestors and some of them have German or French Huguenot ancestors. They are also called Boers, Voortrekkers and Burghers, although under slightly different contexts. In South Africa there are about three million white people with Afrikaans as mother tongue. They are assumed to be Afrikaners if they chose to follow the Afrikaans culture. They began arriving at the Cape of Good Hope when the Dutch East India Company started Cape Town in 1652. Until 1994, they dominated South Africa's politics as well as the country's commercial agricultural sector. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in South Africa",
