 "text": "The Sichuan whipping frog, Boaxing treefrog, or Dugrite's whipping tree frog (Zhangixalus dugritei) is a frog. It lives in China and Vietnam. People have seen it 10,500 feet above sea level. These frogs live in forests and grassy places high on mountains. It lays eggs in pools and ponds. The female frog makes a white foam nest to lays her eggs. She makes the nest in a mud cave or under moss or plants. After the eggs hatch, the rain pushes the tadpoles into the water. The tadpoles live at the bottom of the pond or pool. People have seen this frog between 1400 and 3200 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because there are so many of them alive. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks, for example Hoang Lien Son National Park and Tay Con Linh II National Park. People sometimes cut down the forests to build farms and get wood. Sometimes people catch this frog to eat. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
