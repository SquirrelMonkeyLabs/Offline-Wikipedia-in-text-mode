 "text": "Ambient media means products and services that are used out of our homes and are seen by some people to be different or not like the normal media we see. Examples are notes written on the papers you get when you park your car, on the hanging belts inside trains, signs inside locker rooms at sports clubs, and on the handles of shopping carts at the store. It also involves using ways like showing very large pictures on the walls of buildings, or writing slogans on the inflatable parts of hot air balloons. == References == Category:Advertising",
