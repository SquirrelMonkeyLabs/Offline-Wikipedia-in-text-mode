 "text": "The New England tree frog, gold-striped tree frog, sublime tree frog or glandular tree frog (Ranoidea subglandulosa) is a tree frog from Australia. Even though it is called the New England tree frog, it does not live in New England. It lives on Australia's New England Tablelands. It lives near the Great Dividing Range in Queensland and New South Wales. It lives more than 600 metres above sea level. The adult male frog is 4.0 cm long and the adult female is 5.0 cm long. It can be green or brown on the back and green on the sides. It has a white stripe on each side of its body. Parts of its sides and legs are bright orange. The tadpoles are about 3.5 cm long. Unlike tadpoles of other tree frogs, they do not have teeth or beaks. Instead, they have things similar to tentacles near their mouths. Scientists do not know what the tadpoles eat. This frog is in some danger of dying out. Scientists say this is because human beings take animals to eat grass where the frog lives and collect trees from its forests for lumber. Invasive species such as trout also eat the eggs and tadpoles. Scientists say this frog is related to Ranoidea citropa. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
