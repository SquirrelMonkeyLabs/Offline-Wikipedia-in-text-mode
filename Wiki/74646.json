 "text": "The Lübeck law () was one of a few charters for town privileges. The Lübeck law said there should be a city council (Rat). There should be 20 council members, which were usually elected for 2 years. They were elected by the guilds. People often stayed as members for many years. The first document about the law is from 1226. It was still used in Northern and Northeastern Germany until 1900. About 100 cities around the Baltic Sea used this law. Many cities in the Hanseatic League used this law. ==References== Category:History of Germany Category:History of Latvia Category:History of Estonia",
