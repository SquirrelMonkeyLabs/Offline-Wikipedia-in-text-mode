 "text": "The Bavan Maval, or Bawan Mawal was a territory of fifty two valleys and forts ruled or controlled by Koli chieftain during Maratha Empire. All these forts mostly came in the districts of Pune and Ahmednagar and each fort had a hereditary Koli Nayak or Sardar, due to which the Kolis were known as Mavala. The Koli Nayaks of the fifty-two forts of the Maval region also had a chief called the Sirnayak, headquartered at Junnar, who settled social disputes and maintained order among the Kolis. In 1650, the Bavan Mavals came under the rule of Mughals, due to which Jizya was imposed on the Kolis, due to this, they later revolted against Sultan Auranzeb in the Maval area, after which the Kolis came to be called Mard Mavala. The Mahadev Kolis of Bawan Mavals (52 forts) who were called 'Mard Mavla, had transformed into a powerful and important army of Chhatrapati Shivaji, because at the behest of Shivaji, the Mahadev Kolis revolted against the Bijapur Sultanate and later against Sultan Aurangzeb of the Mughal Empire under their chief Khemi Sarnaik. Koli nayaks of Bavan Mavals played an important role in establishing Swarajya and in the several battles. == References == Category:Koli people",
