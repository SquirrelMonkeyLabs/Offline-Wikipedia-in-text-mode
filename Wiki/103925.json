 "text": "An exabyte (EB) is a unit of measurement for data equal to 1000 petabytes (PB) or a million trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes. An exabyte is large enough that it would take about 250,000 high-end home computers or 1,000,000 average home computers to store this amount of data. 1 exabyte is equal to 1000 petabyte. For context, 1 petabyte can store about 500 times the storage of a regular gaming PC with 2 terabytes of memory. One thousand exabytes make one zettabyte. Category:Units of information",
