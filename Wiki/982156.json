 "text": "Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia Mozart (30 July 1751 29 October 1829), called Nannerl by her friends and family, was a musician and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's older sister. Mozart toured Europe as a pianist with her brother. When she was 11 years old, she was able to play hard sonatas on the piano. Like her brother, she was very good with music. When she reached the age when she was able to marry, her father thought that her interests should change, and she should pay more attention to her family. All her music that is left are small pieces for the piano. On 23 August 1783, she married Johann Baptist Reichsfreiherr Berchtold von Sonnenburg (1736 1801). Johann Baptist was 15 years older than she was. She lived in St. Gilgen, in his apartment, in the house where her mother was born. She had five children, from two marriages. She bore him three children. When he died, she returned to Salzburg with her two surviving children, Leopold and Jeanette. Marianne died on 29 October 1829, at 78 years, and was buried in St Peter's Cemetery, Salzburg. Category:1751 births Category:1829 deaths Category:Austrian musicians Maria Anna",
