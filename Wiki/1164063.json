 "text": "The Certified Forensic Computer Examiner (CFCE) is a certification demonstrating competency in computer forensics. The International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS), a non-profit, entirely volunteer organization of digital forensic experts, administers the CFCE training and certification. == History == In 1990, IACIS was established. When the training was extended to include a review of Windows-based computers in 1998, the CFCE was launched. Although the MAC OS operating system and related file systems are covered in the course materials as well, the certificate exclusively certifies Windows proficiency. One of the majorities of non-tool certifications in computer forensics for both active and retired law enforcement officers is the CFCE. Members of certain organizations, like Miami-Dade Police's Computer Forensics Laboratory, must earn and keep this accreditation. == References == Category:Computer security",
