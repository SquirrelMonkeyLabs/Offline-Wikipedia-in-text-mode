The video featured \"Look at Me\" for the first half and \"Riot\" for the second half of the video. In the video, it begins with a woman called Dildo Uni, who has a dildo strapped to her head. She comes down from the sky and says \"Behold my liege I am you nobel steed.\" The next scene has X enter a classroom on someone's shoulders and he beats up the teacher. The song ends and \"Riot\" starts. The video then shows X and other black men lynched in a forest. The names and footage of Emmett Till, Philando Castile, Rodney King, Heather Heyer, and the Ferguson riots appear across the next seconds. The video then shows two young boys, one white and one black, being lead onto a stage where a noose is hanging. The music then cuts as X puts the noose around the white boy's neck and hangs him in front of an audience. At the end, the video shows X sitting on a stool and reading from his phone. He lists off different race- based violent events. He says he is speaking for the youth and calls for racial equality. The video caused controversy. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2015 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Hip hop songs",
