The reserve encompasses the city's Old Town and its landmarks, preserving over 200 monuments from the 11th to 19th centuries. It serves as a center for cultural heritage, historical research, and tourism. == Historical development == * Foundation and early use: The area has been a significant settlement since the 11th century. It became an administrative and military center during the Galician-Volhynian State and later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 14th century. Kamianets-Podilskyi's strategic location led to the development of fortifications like the Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle. * Soviet era and modern preservation: During the Soviet period, industrialization impacted many historical sites. Efforts to restore and preserve the Old Town began in the 20th century, leading to the area's designation as a historical reserve. Significant restoration projects have since protected its medieval architecture and urban layout. == Key features == The reserve includes: * Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle: A fortified complex dating back to the 12th century, showcasing medieval military architecture. * Polish Market Square: Central to the Old Town, surrounded by historic merchant houses. * Armenian Quarter: Featuring unique architectural styles reflecting the city's multicultural past. * Dominican Monastery and Church of St. Nicholas: Religious structures that highlight Gothic and Baroque influences. == Cultural importance == The reserve plays a vital role in Ukrainian heritage, organizing cultural events, exhibitions, and festivals to promote its history. It has become a popular destination for both domestic and international tourists, reflecting its status as a UNESCO World Heritage candidate.
