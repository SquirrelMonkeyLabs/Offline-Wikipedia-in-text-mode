The United Nations sought to protect Bosnia and created safe zones. ==Srebrenica massacre== The Srebrenica massacre happened in July 1995 when the Serbs invaded the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. They raped women, and forced men and boys into the forests. The men were hunted down by the Serbs. ==Denial== ===Serbia=== In Serbia, many people have said that the Bosnian genocide was not real. However, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) confirmed that the Bosnian genocide was real. * * * * * ===Western countries=== In Western countries, Bosnian genocide denial is common among left-wing \"anti- imperialist\" intellectuals. * * * * * * * * * * They often accuse the NATO of \"inventing\" the Bosnian genocide to justify the bombing and \"destruction\" of Yugoslavia. They tend to blame the victims of the genocide for their own suffering, just as modern antisemites do to Jews. * * * * * Bosnian genocide deniers in Western countries are mostly left-wing, including but not limited to David Peterson, Diana Johnstone, Edward S. Herman, Jared Israel, Mick Hume, Michael Parenti, Tariq Ali. Many of them have non-negligible influence in Western academia. * * * * Kirsch, Adam (2024), On Settler Colonialism: Ideology, Violence, and Justice, W.W.
