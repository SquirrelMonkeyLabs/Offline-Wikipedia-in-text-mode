 "text": "Greening's frog (Corythomantis greeningi) is a frog that lives in northeastern Brazil. The adult male frog is about 7.3 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 8.7 cm long. The male frog weighs about 21 grams and the female frog 41 grams. Its skin is rough and warty. It has chemicals on its skin that scientists think might be poison. The poison might keep other animals from eating the frog. All adult frogs are brown in color, but the adult female frog has dark marks on her back and the adult male frog does not. The frog's head looks like tree bark. This frog can live in dry places, like savannah grasslands and rocky places. During the dry time of year, this frog spends much time resting on tree branches. Unlike other frogs, Greening's frog can move its head from side to side without moving the rest of its body. This frog will sometimes hide its body in a hole in the ground or in a tree and block the entrance with its head. It lays eggs along the edges of rivers as they are drying down for the year. That way, the tadpoles grow in small pools with no fish to eat them. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
