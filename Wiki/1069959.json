 "text": "Khaybar Khaybar ya yahud (Arabicː خَيَبَرِ خَيَبَرِ يَاَ يَهُوُدْ جَيَشِ مُحَمَدْ سَوُفَ يَعُوُدْ) is an Arabic chant used in memory of the Battle of Khaybar where Muhammad, the founder of Islam, defeated the Jews of Khaybar, an oasis in modern Saudi Arabia. The chant is antisemitic towards Jews annd Israelis as it implies a promise and threat towards killing Jews. However, anti-Jewish and pro-Palestinian extremists have claimed this is ‘actually’ a rallying cry by Palestinians (and their supporters).* * * * * * It is important to note that word Yahud means Jew, and the full phrase is “Khaybar, Khaybar, O Jews, the army of Muhammad is returning.” Those who try to change this meaning towards Palestinianism negate their claim of ‘talking cry’ as Palestinians in no way are referred to in said phrase, only the slaughter of Jews. Support for this phrase is antisemitic and any attempts to normalize the phrase indicate a denial of historical accountings. ==References== Category:Jewish people Category:Asia Category:Racism Category:West Asia Category:Palestine Category:Middle East Category:Antisemitism Category:Discrimination Category:History of Asia Category:History of West Asia Category:Arabic words and phrases",
