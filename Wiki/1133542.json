 "text": "A Hail Mary pass is when a quarterback throws a forward pass in football deep down field. A Hail Mary pass has a very rare chance of being completed. The pass is usually made when the quarterback is in desperation or the time on the clock is running out. The name of the play is a reference to the Hail Mary prayer in Catholicism. The play became well known by football media after a game on December 28, 1975 when Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach was describing his game-winning pass and said \"I closed my eyes and said a Hail Mary.\" The origins of the term go as far back as the 1930s when it was used by the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and other universities of Catholic background. ==References== Category:American football Category:Canadian football Category:Sports words",
