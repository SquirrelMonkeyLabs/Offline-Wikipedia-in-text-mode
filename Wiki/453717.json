Justin Gabriel released a photo on his official Instagram of himself getting \"scanned\" for what appears to be the Eco-Motion engine that was used in NBA 2K14's next generation game. Former NXT Chris Hero (Kassius Ohno) also did some motion-captioning for the game. 2K's community manager, Ronnie Singh described the Eco-Motion engine as \"One example of the Eco-Motion Engine in action is the new fluid nature of player animations. Gone are the days of pre-canned animations that must play out exactly as they were mocapped. Now, players adjust their movements based on the environment around them.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website Category:2014 video games 2K15 Category:2K Sports games Category:Yuke's games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Professional wrestling video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games",
