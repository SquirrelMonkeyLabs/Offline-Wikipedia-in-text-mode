 "text": "An Independent Power Producer (IPP) or Non-Utility Generator (NUG) is an organisation that owns a power-producing facility and can sell electricity to utility companies and electricity users. An IPP is usually a private company and is generally not a public utility company. Transaction of electricity between IPP with its customers are usually regulated under the power purchase agreement. An independent water and power producer (IWPP) is similar to an IPP, but with a unified process to also output usable treated water. == References == Category:Electric power companies",
