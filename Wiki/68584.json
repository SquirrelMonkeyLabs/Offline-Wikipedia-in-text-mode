 "text": "A desk is a piece of furniture where someone can sit and write, often with drawers or other places to put books, papers, pencils, pens and other things. Unlike a table, there is only one side of the desk where somebody could sit. Desks come in many different sizes. There is a Armoire desk, which is very big. There is also a portable desk which is very small. Desks can be used at home. They can also be used in an office. Desks may also be used in schools. A computer desk will have a computer inside or on top. The keyboard and mouse will pull out from underneath the desk. Category:Furniture ro:Birou (mobilier)",
