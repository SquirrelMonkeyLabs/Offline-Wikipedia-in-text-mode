 "text": "Höðr (also written Hodhr, Hothr, Hothur, Hoder, Hodur, Hodor, Hodr) is the blind twin brother of Baldr and son of Odin and Frigg in Norse mythology. He is shown as having his eyes closed or covering them completely. Höðr is associated as the god of winter and the cold as well as being the god of darkness, unlike his brother Baldr, who is god of light. The only source of information of him thus far is when he is seen as being manipulated and tricked by Loki, and therefore accidentally killing his brother Baldr by throwing a shaft of mistletoe and piercing him in the heart. Höðr's sworn enemy is Váli, who is born to avenge his brother's death by killing Höðr. It was said that after Ragnarök, Höðr and Baldr shall survive to rule alongside each other.
