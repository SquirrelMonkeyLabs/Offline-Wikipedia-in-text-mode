 "text": "Sega Technical Institute (STI) was an American development division of Sega. It was created by Mark Cerny in 1991. They wanted to combine good Japanese developers, including Sonic Team programmer Yuji Naka and his team, with new American developers. STI created many Sonic the Hedgehog games, as well as other games for the Sega Genesis. It closed in late 1996. Games developed by STI are important in the history of the Genesis, and many were well-received or sold well. Developers have described STI as a unique workplace that did not fit into Sega's corporate structure, and have fond memories of the environment. ==Games created== Game Year released STI development team Dick Tracy 1991 American Kid Chameleon 1992 American Greendog: The Beached Surfer Dude! 1992 American Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (with Sonic Team) 1992 Both Sonic Spinball 1993 American Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (with Sonic Team) 1994 Japanese Sonic & Knuckles (with Sonic Team) 1994 Japanese Comix Zone 1995 American The Ooze 1995 American Die Hard Arcade (with Sega-AM1) 1996 American Sonic X-treme Cancelled American ==References== Category:Sega divisions and subsidiaries",
