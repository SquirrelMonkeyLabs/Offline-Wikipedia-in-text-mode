Dairy Queen's menu is mostly soft serve ice cream, hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken. One of Dairy Queen's most popular items is the Blizzard. It was first made in 1985. It is a cup of soft-serve mixed with different ingredients. They come in many different flavors. Sometime the server will flip the blizzard upside down to show how thick the treat is. On August 17, 1987, Dairy Queen bought the drink chain Orange Julius. ==Operations== Dairy Queen is currently operated in: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Dairy Queen was previously operated in: * (withdrew around 1999) * * (withdrew in the 2000s) * * * (withdrew in the 1990s) * * (withdrew in 1999; expected to reenter) * (withdrew in the 2010s) * (withdrew in the 2000s) * (withdrew in 2016) * (withdrew in May 2016) * * (withdrew in the 2000s, expected to reenter) * (withdrew in 2000) * (withdrew in the 1990s) * (withdrew in 2016) ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:1940 establishments in Illinois Category:American fast food restaurants",
