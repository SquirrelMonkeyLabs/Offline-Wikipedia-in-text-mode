The group says its mission is \"to halt and reverse the destruction of our natural environment\". Much of its work focuses on the conservation of three biomes that contain most of the world's biodiversity: forests, freshwater ecosystems, and oceans and coasts. Among other issues, it is also concerned with endangered species, pollution and climate change. The organization runs more than 1,200 field projects worldwide each year. == References == Category:International environmental organizations Category:Organizations based in Switzerland Category:Conservation Category:Charities Category:Nyon (district)",
