 "text": "Millard Fillmore (January 7, 1800 â€“ March 8, 1874) was the 13th president of the United States. He was president from 1850 to 1853. He was the last Whig president, and the last president who was not a Democrat or Republican. Fillmore became president in 1850, when the previous president, Zachary Taylor died. The Whig party did not pick him to run for president in 1852. He ran for president in 1856, for the American Party but lost. ==Early life== Millard Fillmore grew up in a poor family. He worked hard to do well in school, and went to college. He got a job as a lawyer in 1823. In 1828, he was voted to be part of the New York congress, and made friends in the Whig Party. This helped him get chosen to run for vice president in 1848. ==Presidency== When he was vice president, Millard Fillmore was in charge of the United States Senate while it was fighting over a decision about slavery involving Texas and New Mexico. When he became president, the slavery issue was very intense (to the point where the southern states were close to choosing to not be a part of the United States anymore). Fillmore signed the Compromise of 1850 (five laws which would calm down the slavery issue by pleasing both the northern states and the southern states). Although the Compromise of 1850 made the northern states and the southern states get along, the peace did not last forever. In the late 1850s, the north and the south stopped getting along. He personally fought a fire at the Library of Congress and then signed a bill to fund the replacement of all the books that were destroyed in the fire. California was made a part of the U.S. on September 9, 1850. It became the 31st state. His decision to sign the Compromise of 1850, made many of the people in his Whig Party upset at him. They stopped him from running for president in 1852. He started the first library at the White House. == After being president == After Fillmore, Franklin Pierce became the 14th president. Fillmore got a job in charge of the University of Buffalo. Fillmore joined the Know-Nothing Party and tried to run for president again, but the Know Nothing Party was not very successful. He died in Buffalo New York of a stroke at age 74. There is a statue of Millard Fillmore at City Hall in Buffalo, New York. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * Fillmore's White House biography Category:1800 births Category:1874 deaths Category:Deaths from cerebral hemorrhage Category:Presidents of the United States Category:United States representatives from New York (state) Category:Lawyers from New York (state) Category:Deaths from cerebral infarction Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Politicians from Buffalo, New York Category:Unitarians Category:Whig Party (United States) politicians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:American mayors Category:Vice presidents of the United States Category:19th-century presidents of the United States",
