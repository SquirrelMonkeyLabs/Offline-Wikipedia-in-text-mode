 "text": "The Bourne Legacy is a 2012 American action spy movie directed by Tony Gilroy, and is the fourth installment in the series of movies adapted from the Jason Bourne novels originated by Robert Ludlum and continued by Eric Van Lustbader, being preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). Although this movie has the same title as Van Lustbader's first Bourne novel, The Bourne Legacy, the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the movie centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton. == Cast == * Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross * Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing * Edward Norton as Eric Byer * Stacy Keach as Mark Turso * Dennis Boutsikaris as Terrence Ward * Oscar Isaac as Outcome #3 * Joan Allen as Pam Landy * Albert Finney as Dr. Albert Hirsch * David Strathairn as Noah Vosen * Scott Glenn as Ezra Kramer * Donna Murphy as Dita Mandy * Michael Chernus as Arthur Ingram * Corey Stoll as Zev Vendel * Å½eljko Ivanek as Dr. Donald Foite * Shane Jacobson as Mackie * Elizabeth Marvel as Dr. Connie Dowd * John Douglas Thompson as General Paulsen * Louis Ozawa Changchien as LARX #3 * David Wilson Barnes as Drone Spec * Neil Brooks Cunningham as Dr. Dan Hillcott * Corey Johnson as Ray Wills * Michael Berresse as Leonard Category:2012 action movies Category:2010s spy movies Category:2012 thriller movies Category:American action movies Category:American spy movies Category:American thriller movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Drone movies Category:Movies composed by James Newton Howard",
