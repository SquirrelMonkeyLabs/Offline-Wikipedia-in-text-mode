 "text": "North Gaza Governorate محافظة شمال غزة is one of the governorates in the Gaza Strip. The population of the governorate is estimated at 281 thousand people in 2005, distributed among the population centers and includes (the city of Jabalia, the city of Beit Lahia, and the city of Beit Hanoun). The Palestinian Authority assumed the administration of the governorate in implementation of the Oslo Agreement in 1993, after the Israeli army forces had used it as their headquarters during the occupation of the Gaza Strip between 1967 and 1994. == Human Rights and Environmental problems == In addition to the ongoing dangers of the wastewater treatment plant to the environment and the health of the population, the sewage treatment plant poses a major threat to the security and safety of the residents of the surrounding areas, and the consequences of the leakage and flooding of wastewater do not affect the village of Umm Al- Nasr alone, but the entire region, especially the city of Beit Lahia, which is inhabited by about 55,000 people. The municipality built 9-meter-high barriers, but the high water level, especially in the winter, threatens to collapse the earthen barriers, which would constitute a new environmental disaster. Our prediction came true when one of the ponds exploded, killing nine people and forcing the Bedouin village to abandon its inhabitants last month. == Governors == * Zahdi Mahmoud Saeed Amer, (September 15, 1996-2001) * Sakher Bseiso, (2001-February 2005) * Ismail Mohammed Yassin Abu Shamala, (March 27, 2005-2013) * Salah Ihsan Muhammad Abu Warda, (July 2, 2014 - August 10, 2023 ) == References == Category:Gaza Strip",
