 "text": "Nongshaba or Nongsaba () is a Lion God in Meitei religion (Sanamahism) and mythology. He is also the king of the gods. He made light for the world. He made the sun. He is worshipped by the people of both the Ningthouja clans as well as the Moirang clans. God Nongshaba is worshipped in Moirang as the father of God Thangching (Thangjing). He is the most powerful and important of the Umang Lais () in Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur). He made his only son Thangching (Thangjing) the king of Moirang. == History == The culture of God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) was brought from Moirang, to Meitei King Khagemba (). Two people, Mungyaang Ngairaangba and Yumnaam Tonba, brought the worship of Nongshaba to Moirang. During the reign of King Khagemba () (r. 1597-1652 AD), worshippers began to think of Nongsaba as the King of the gods. God Nongsaba was recognised as an Umang Lai. The people built a temple. With this, other Umang Lai gods and goddesses became lower ranking gods and goddesses. During this time, a Meitei family named \"Leithangbam\" managed the temple of Nongsaba. \"Phura\" was a group of maibis . They worship God Nongsaba. During the time of Meitei king Paikhomba (), there was a religious marriage ceremony of princess Yaosombi () and God Nongsaba. In the event, an elephant was offered to the god. From the time of King Khagemba until the time of King Charairongba, God Nongsaba was more popular than God Sanamahi. During the time of King Garibniwaz (), on the 12th of November 1723, Brahmins (priests of Hinduism) started controlling the temples of Nongsaba (Nongshaba) and Yimthei Lai, Panthoibi and Taibangkhaiba (Sanamahi). After 1726 AD, the culture of worshipping God Nongsaba did not survive for a long time. His worshipping culture was replaced by the different gods and goddesses of Hinduism. On 17 October 1732, King Garibniwaz () and his teacher Shantidas Gosai closed the temples of Nongshaba as well as Sanamahi, Yumtheilai, Panthoibi, and other Umang Lais. == Mythology == According to the Meitei mythology, Kangla Sha is another form of God Nongshaba. According to the \"Nongshaba Laihui\" (\"Nongsaba Laihui\") book, God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) is the second son of the Universal God. He is also known as \"Tholbu Chinglen Nongdai Ningthou\". According to the book, God Nongsaba doesn't have much duty or any big role in the creation of the universe. Unlike his younger brother Pakhangba, Nongsaba did not disturb his elder brother Asheeba (alias Sanamahi). He stayed away from disturbing Asheeba. Unlike his younger brother Pakhangba, Nongsaba does not have any human children. Unlike his elder brother Sanamahi, Nongsaba does not have any human forms. These are mentioned in the Meitei language books, the Pakhangba Laihui and the Sanamahi Laihui. The Nongsaba Laihui (Nongshaba Laihui) describes the greatness of God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) as follows: The \"Nongsaba Laihui\" book also says about God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) as follows: The book says that all the Umang Lai gods and goddesses (including Sanamahi) are junior of God Nongsaba (Nongshaba). According to Dr. Saroj Nalini Arambam Parratt, the second lines of the Meitei poem \"Anoirol\" mentions many sky deities. In the song, Nongshaba is said to be the god of the sky of Moirang. This song is sung in the Lai Haraoba, . == Worship == People who worship Nongshaba give him white clothes, fruit, flowers, white fish (preferably \"Sareng\" ()) and other clothes. These are the same types of gifts that people offer to Pakhangba and Yumjao Lairembi (Yumjao Leima). In early times, God Nongshaba was worshipped along with Pakhangba, in the \"Naoshumshang\" (). The God gives long life to the Meitei kings. In \"Khoibaching\", Manipur, a round shaped stone is worshipped as God Nongshaba. The holy place is protected by the kings. It was worshipped by the kings only. It is 6 cubits deep. According to Meitei culture, the \"Phura\" is a group of the maibis . They take care of the temples of God Nongshaba.
