 "text": "Felsőszenterzsébet is a village in Lenti District of Zala County. Its population in 2024 was 16. == Location == Felsőszenterzsébet is located on a hilly area between the Kerka and Lendva rivers. It can be reached by road from Kerkakutas, via the 74 133 road branching off from the 7416 road, passing through Alsószenterzsébet. On weekdays, two buses stop in the village, coming from Csesztreg and Lenti. There is no public transportation on weekends. == History == The small village was first mentioned in 1334 as Scentelsebeth, then in 1375 as Zenthelsebeth, and in 1501 as Felsewzenthersebeth. Its name comes from Saint Elizabeth, the patron saint of its former church. The village’s population peaked in the last years of the 19th century, but historical changes have steadily reduced it. Nearby larger towns offered better job opportunities than local farming. Additionally, due to the borders created by the Treaty of Trianon and the poor Hungarian-Yugoslav relations, development was not possible here between the two world wars or in the 1950s and 1960s. == Population == In 2022, 87.5% of the population identified as Hungarian, 12.5% as German, 6.3% as Slovenian, and 12.5% as other non-local nationalities (due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%). In terms of religion, 25% were Roman Catholic, 18.8% Reformed, 6.3% Lutheran, 6.3% other Christian, and 6.3% non-religious (37.5% did not respond). == Notes == Category:Villages in Hungary Category:Zala County",
