It stars Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, Klaus Wennemann, Jan Fedder and Otto Sander with Günter Lamprecht. It is set in the early 1940s. It is based on the 1973 novel Das Boot. == Overview == The plotline is the story of a German submarine in WWII in the Battle of the Atlantic. At first the going is easy, and the boat very successful. Gradually it gets more and more difficult are various anti-submarine measures are put in place by Britain. This takes a toll on the morale of the crew and captain. The movie received many positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert who gave the movie 4/4 stars. It was based on a book of the same title. One curious feature of the film was that Columbia Pictures released both a German version and an English-dubbed version in the United States. The film's German version gross taking was much higher than the English-dubbed version at the United States box-office.EDITORIAL: Life Isn’t Beautiful Anymore, it’s Dubbed | IndieWire == Other websites == * == References == Category:1981 drama movies Category:1981 war movies Category:1980s epic movies Category:German drama movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies directed by Wolfgang Petersen Category:Movies set underwater Category:Movies set in the 1940s Category:World War II movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:English-language movies Category:French-language movies Category:German action movies Category:German-language movies Category:Miniseries",
