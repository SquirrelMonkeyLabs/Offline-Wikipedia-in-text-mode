The procedure is based on the Latin phrase qui tacet consentire videtur which means \"he who is silent is taken to agree\" or \"silence means consent\".Robertson, John G. (1991). Robertson's Words for a Modern Age: A Cross Reference of Latin and Greek Combining Elements, p. 249.

(2006). Policy Analysis in National Security Affairs: New Methods for a New Era, p. 142. and the European Union (EU).Dubowski, Tomsz. (2011). Constitutional Law of the European Union, p. 105.
