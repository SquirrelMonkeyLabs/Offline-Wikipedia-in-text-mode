 "text": "The fringed leaf frog (Cruziohyla craspedopus) is a frog that lives in Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, and Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 30 and 1600 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== This is a large frog with green skin and pale spots. It has yellow color on its legs and sides. There are brown bars vertically down its sides. The adult male frog is 55 to 57 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 69 to 73 mm long. ==Home== This frog lives in forest that has never been cut down. It lives high in the trees where the branches come together like a roof. ==Eggs and tadpoles== Unlike other leaf frogs, the female fringed leaf frog puts her eggs right in the water, about 14 to 21 eggs at a time. Scientists once saw adult frogs moving their eggs from the water to a mass of roots hanging over the water. People have seen the tadpoles in very small pools of water: For example, in the hollows of trees or in large puddles where larger animals have wallowed in the mud. Scientists think these tadpoles can swim and grow in bodies of water made by humans if there are enough trees close by. ==Threats== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
