 "text": "Varna is a social concept from the Brahmin leaders of Hinduism in India. People became divided into four classes depending on their type of work. Brahmins were priests and teachers. Kshatriyas were the warriors. Vaishyas did agriculture, trading and commerce. The shudras were the general working class. A common misconception is that the Vaishyas and Shudras were generally looked down upon, and treated badly by Brahmins and Kshatriyas. This was true for the later part of the Vedic period but untrue for the earlier part. This type of social division is called the Varna system in Hinduism.
