 "text": "Psion Organiser was the brand name of two pocket computers developed by the British company Psion in the 1980s. The Organiser I (launched in 1984) and Organiser II (launched in 1986) had a hard plastic sliding cover protecting a 6Ã—6 keypad unlike a computer keyboard, with letters arranged alphabetically. They competed with the Filofax and can be considered the first personal digital assistant. They had an electronic diary and searchable address database in a small, portable device. The Organiser I had an 8-bit Hitachi 6301-family processor, running at 0.9 MHz, with 4 KB of read-only memory and 2 KB of static RAM and a one-row monochrome liquid crystal display screen. It weighed 225 grams. The Organiser II had its own Organiser Programming Language. It was used by Marks & Spencer, by surveyors who used it with electronic theodolites and by the British government to do social security calculations. == References == Category:Personal digital assistants",
