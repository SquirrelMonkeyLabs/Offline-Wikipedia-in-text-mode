 "text": "Henry VIII had six wives, Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr (in that order). All of his wives, except for Catherine Parr, died or were divorced by Henry VIII. Catherine of Aragon was his first wife. She was married to Henry for almost 24 years, but the marriage was anulled after failing to produce a son. Her daughter was the future Queen of England. Anne Boleyn was his second wife and was beheaded after allegedly cheating on Henry and not producing a son. Her daughter was the future Queen of England. Jane Seymour was his third wife. She gave birth to a son but died of childbed fever. Her son was the future King of England. Henry fell in love with Anne of Cleves's portrait, however when he met her, she didn't look like she did on her picture, thus causing Henry and Anne to get divorced within 6 months. At about 16 years old, Katherine Howard was next in line for the hand of the king. However, after Henry found out about Catherine's affair with Thomas Culpepper and Francis Dereham, she was beheaded. Catherine Parr was the last of the six wives and outlived Henry. Almost a year and a half later, after Henry's death, Catherine Parr died after giving birth to her daughter, Mary Seymour. ==Further reading== * * Category:16th century in England Category:House of Tudor",
