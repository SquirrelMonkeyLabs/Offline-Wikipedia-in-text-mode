 "text": "Abinary gender represents gender identities that are completely unrelated to the gender binary. Some identify with a binary gender as female or male, others as neither female nor male, as abinary or beyond the binary gender model. With the term abinary people we refer to persons who do not or not only identify as women* or men* or not (only) female or male. Also common is the self-designation non-binary, which centers in the word formation by the suffix 'non-' the deviation from a binary norm as a moment of absence, which is why we use the positive self-designation abinary. The term abinary may encompass specific identities, such maverique, agender, neutrois, and some xenogenders. == References == Category:Non-binary gender",
