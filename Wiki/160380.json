 "text": "This page lists every locomotive allocated a TOPS classification and all modern traction (e.g. diesel, electric, gas turbine, petrol) stock used on the mainline network since 1948 (i.e. British Railways and post-privatisation). == Diesel locomotives == The 1955 diesel locomotive classes are given in brackets where applicable. A large number of different shunter types were purchased by British Rail and its predecessors, many of which were withdrawn prior to the introduction of TOPS. The tables below attempt to list the different types and the different classifications used to describe them as clearly as possible: === Small shunters: under 300 hp === Shunter classes are listed by 1955 class, which puts TOPS classes in ascending order, and generally puts 1948 and 1962 classes in ascending order. Unclassed shunters are placed at the start of the table; TOPS class 07 has been placed so its 1962 class is in the logical place.

These locomotives were allocated the TOPS classification Class 22 for their use on British railways Departmental Class 97 General departmental locomotives, used for special or engineering duties. Were therefore of many different classes, lumped together for numbering purposes. Forty-seven locomotives allocated Class 97 numbers, including five in subclass 97/6. Departmental Class 97/6 Five diesel shunting locomotives purpose-built for departmental duties in 1953 (number 97650) and 1959 (numbers 97651-654). Withdrawn 1987-2005. Departmental Various Pre-TOPS Departmental Locomotives Various Pre-TOPS Departmental Locomotives Various Pre-TOPS Departmental Locomotives Steam Class 98 Used to cover all steam locomotives used on the mainline in Britain. Had particular usage for the three Vale of Rheidol Railway steam locomotives that remained in BR's ownership after the end of mainline steam traction in August 1968, and numbered 98007-98009. Also used for privately-owned steam locomotives registered to run on the mainline since 1971, with numbers allocated in the following way: * First two digits: 98 (for class 98) * Third digit: 0-9 representing the Power Class 0-9 * Fourth and fifth digits: The last two digits of the locomotive's original number. If this would duplicate an existing number, then the number is increased by 1. Petrol 15097-15099 Petrol powered locomotives built by Simplex, introduced 1919-1925 by the LNER, and subsequently inherited by BR Gas turbine 18000 Prototype mainline gas turbine locomotive built for BR in 1949 by Brown Boveri. Had been ordered by GWR in 1940, but construction was delayed due to World War II. 18100 Prototype mainline gas turbine locomotive built for BR in 1951 by Metropolitan Vickers. Had been ordered by the GWR in the 1940s, but construction was delayed due to World War II. ===Class 99=== When British Rail implemented the TOPS system for managing their operating stock, part of their shipping fleet was incorporated into the system as Class 99, in order to circumvent some of the restrictions of the application software. ===Builders' demonstrators=== These were locomotives built and owned by private firms, but used by British Rail to test them.
