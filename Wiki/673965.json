 "text": "Peter Popoff (born July 2, 1946) is a German-born/American televangelist. He was exposed in 1986 for using an earpiece to receive radio messages from his wife Elizabeth. She gave him the names, addresses and ailments of members of the audience during Popoff-led religious services. Popoff falsely said God revealed the information to him so he could cure them by faith healing. Popoff went bankrupt in 1987. But he made a comeback in the late 1990s. Beginning around the mid-2000s, he bought television time to promote \"Miracle Spring Water\" on late-night infomercials. He referred to himself as a prophet. The Business Insider said: \"No matter how many times his claims are debunked, he seems to bounce back with another version of the same old scam.\" Popoff was born in West Berlin, Germany. He was raised in California. ==References== Category:Television evangelists Category:American television personalities Category:People from California Category:1946 births Category:Living people",
