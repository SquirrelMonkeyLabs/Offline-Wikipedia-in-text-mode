 "text": "The Sphenodontia is a diverse group of reptile. It includes only one living genus, the tuatara (Sphenodon). An alternative name for the order is the Rhynchocephalia. They are an offshoot from the evolutionary line leading to the lizards and snakes. They had many families during the late Triassic and Jurassic periods but then declined. They are now are the least successful of the lepidosaurs.Evans S.E. & Jones M.E.H. 2010. The origin, early history and diversification of lepidosauromorph reptiles. In Bandyopadhyay S.
