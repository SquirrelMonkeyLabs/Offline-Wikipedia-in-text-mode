 "text": "Mississippi State University is a university in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi, just outside the city limits of Starkville. It has 22,649 students and has the largest single-campus enrollment of any college in the state of Mississippi. (The University of Mississippi has more total students, but almost all of its health science programs are housed in its medical center in Jackson instead of its main campus near Oxford.) The college was opened in 1878 as a land-grant university. Its sports teams, nicknamed Bulldogs, play in the Southeastern Conference. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website *Official sports website Category:Colleges and universities in Mississippi Mississippi State Category:1878 establishments in the United States Category:1870s establishments in Mississippi",
