 "text": "The 2024 presidential campaign of Donald Trump was a successful presidential campaign by Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election on November 15, 2022. Trump won the Republican primaries to become the Republican nominee. He chose JD Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio, as his running mate. On November 5, 2024, Trump and Vance defeated incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz in the Electoral College and were elected to become the 47th president and 50th vice president of the United States. Trump became the second president after Grover Cleveland to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms. == Background == After Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Trump became the first incumbent president since the 1992 U.S. presidential election to lose his reelection bid. Trump also became the first president since George H. W. Bush to serve one four-year term. After he lost the election, Trump refused to concede to Biden and accept his loss. He later made widespread false claims of election and voter fraud, despite no evidence to support his claims. Trump later made many attempts to overturn the election results, block the presidential transition, and stop the certification of Biden's election victory. These events later resulted in the attack on the United States Capitol, which left five people dead and later resulted in his second impeachment, becoming the first U.S. president to be impeached twice. On November 15, 2022, he announced his candidacy for 2024 presidential election. This also officially makes Trump's fourth presidential campaign, as he ran for president in 2000, 2016, 2020, and is running again in 2024. This later caused wide speculation that both Trump and Biden may face a potential rematch in the 2024 election. However, Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, 2024, being replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris. As of 2024, there are multiple factors working against Trump such as his major criminal cases and legal issues. In July 2024, Trump picked U.S. Senator JD Vance to be his running mate in the 2024 presidential election. In November 2024, the Trump-Vance ticket won the election, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz. ==Notes== ==References== Trump, Donald Presidential campaign 2024",
