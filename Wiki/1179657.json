 "text": "Vampire Survivors is a 2022 roguelike shoot 'em up video game made by Luca Galante, known by his pseudonym Poncle. == Gameplay == In the game you control a character that has to fight waves of monsters, trying to survive the attack for as long as possible; at the end of each game, the player may unlock new characters, weapons, and relics for future sessions. The game is a roguelike so it is always randomized; for example you will occasionally be chosen to select from 3 or more random weapons once you collect enough gems from killing enemies.
