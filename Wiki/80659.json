 "text": "The Battle of Uhud () was fought on 23 March 625 (7 Shawwal 3 AH of the Islamic calendar) at Mount Uhud, in what is now north-western Saudi Arabia. It occurred between a force from the Muslim community of Medina led by Prophet Muhammad, and a force led by Abu Sufyan from Mecca, the town from which many of the Muslims had previously emigrated (hijra). The Battle of Uhud was the second military encounter between the Meccans and the Muslims, after the Battle of Badr in 624, where a small Muslim army had defeated the larger Meccan army. For the Muslims, the battle was a big setback. == Background == Prophet Muhammad had preached the religion of Islam in Mecca from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also had opposition from the rest of the Quraysh, the clan that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as Yathrib). They considered themselves to be in a state of war with Mecca and raided Meccan caravans that had Muslim belongings left in Mecca. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 624, a small Muslim force had defeated the much larger Meccan army.Peters (1994). pp. 211—214. Many Muslims considered this battle's victory a proof that they had been favored by God (Arabic: Allah), and believed they were assured such victories in the future.Watt (1964). pp. 142—143. == Battle == Quraysh soldiers met the Muslims at Uhud. Abu Sufyan and his Army flanked the Muslims, 'Amr ibn al-'As was leading the Muslim Cavalry then he fought against them, Muslim archers threw rocks at the Quraysh, they were forced to go back. The person who holds the Quraysh Flag was charging and he fought Ali ibn Abi Talib and then he was hit in the shoulder. Then Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib came in and fought many people.Muir, p. 259 == Bibliography == ;Books and journals * * * * * * ;Encyclopedias * == References == == Other websites == * The battle of Uhud * What were the reasons of the battle of Uhud? * http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/audio/yasir_index.htm * http://www.shia.org/ohud.html Category:Battles of the Middle Ages Category:History of Islam Category:625 Category:7th-century conflicts",
