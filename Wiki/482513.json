Most of the books were given by the government of the United States and individual Americans. Popular American magazines were also in the library. Unlike other libraries in Cuba at that time, the institute's library let people borrow books for reading outside of the library. The director was the Cuban historian Herminio Portell Vilá. In 1945, the institute began publishing a bulletin entitled Dos Pueblos, first for students but later sent to libraries abroad. \"El Instituto Cultural Cubano-Norteamericano\" by Waldo Fernández Cuenca: http://www.palabranueva.net/newPage/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=1095:el- instituto-cultural-cubano-norteamericano&catid;=321:sociedad&Itemid;=385, citing 1 “La circulación de dos pueblos”, boletín Dos Pueblos, enero-abril, 1947, pp. 9-10.
