 "text": "The Battle of Jalandhar Doab was a confrontation between the Sikh Dal Khalsa and the Durrani Empire, led by Saâ€™adat Khan Afridi and Khwajah Ubaid Khan. This battle, marked by Sikh raids and strategic victories, severely weakened Afghan control over the Punjab region and expanded Sikh influence. ==Background== The Sikhs were more confident after successfully opposing Afghan soldiers in previous battles. They stormed Afghan outposts, interfered with government, and demanded karah prasad, a holy sacrifice of bread, sugar, and ghee, from the local populace. With every Sikh attack, the Durrani Empire's power continued to decline as it battled to maintain control over Punjab. Sa'adat Khan Afridi tried to retake power in early 1758 but was routed in the Jalandhar Doab and had to retreat to the hills. The subedar of Lahore responded by sending Khwajah Ubaid Khan and a force of 25,000 men to stop the Sikh advance, but the Afghans too failed in this endeavor. ==Battle== In a series of raids, the Sikhs attacked Khwajah Ubaid Khan's men using successful guerilla tactics, causing significant Afghan casualties. The Sikhs took all of Ahmad Shah Durrani's remaining artillery, slaughtered several of Ubaid Khan's officers, and pillaged his camp and supplies. Sikh soldiers expanded into the Bari Doab region, invading the suburbs of Batala, Kalanaur, and Lahore as Afghan forces were in disarray. With numerous Sikhs conducting nighttime raids and pillaging the city's surrounding districts, witness Tahmas Khan characterized the situation in Lahore as catastrophic. The Afghan administration's weakness was shown when the gates of Lahore were forced to close by 10 p.m. in order to prevent more assaults. ==Aftermath== In an effort to reorganize and regain power after the loss at Jalandhar Doab, Jahan Khan proceeded from Lahore. He reunited with his retreating men at Batala and severely punished Murad Khan by ordering his whipping, out of rage at the defeats and the spread of Sikh power. The Afghan control over the area weakened in spite of these campaigns, and the Sikhs established their power throughout Punjab, eventually overthrowing Afghan rule. ==References== Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:1758 Category:18th century in India",
