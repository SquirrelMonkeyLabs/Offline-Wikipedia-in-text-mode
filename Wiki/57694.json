 "text": "The voting system is a set of rules about the way people vote and how the votes are counted. Different countries have different voting systems. There are many different types of voting system. One of the first voting systems to be used is called \"first-past-the-post\". Under this system each voter writes an \"x\" next to their chosen candidate. At the end, the votes are counted. The candidate with the most votes wins.
