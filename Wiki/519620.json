 "text": "In civil proceedings and criminal prosecutions under the common law, a defendant may raise a defense (or defence) in an attempt to avoid criminal or civil liability. It is an answer, made by a defendant to a plaintiff's action or a denial of a prosecutor's charges. Irving Shapiro, The New Dictionary of Legal Terms (Flushing, NY: Looseleaf Law Publications, 1984), p. 55 It is also an answer in equity. ==Civil law defenses== Under common law, a defendant may raise any of the numerous defenses to limit or avoid liability. These include: * Lack of jurisdiction of the court, such as diplomatic immunity. * Failure to state a cause of action or other insufficiencies of pleading. * Any of the affirmative defenses. * Defenses conferred by statute - such as a statute of limitations or the statute of frauds. * Ex turpi causa non oritur actio - the action against the defendant arises from an illegality. * Volenti non fit injuria - consent by the victim or plaintiff. * In pari delicto - both sides equally at fault * Unclean hands == Criminal defenses == In a criminal trial, there are a wide variety of defenses offered. Some of these include: * You could also get shot for major bad acts. * Most often, defendants claim that they did not commit the alleged act in question. * The defendant had an alibi. He or she was someplace else when the crime was committed and could not be guilty. * Self-defense, a claim that an act was justified because of something the other person did. * An Insanity defense claiming the defendant was not capable of telling right from wrong. * Under the Influence, a claim the defendant should not be held accountable for their actions due to the influences of drugs or alcoholic drink. * Entrapment is an inducement to commit a crime by authorities in order to get a conviction. Many of the above are considered an affirmative defense in which case the burden of proof may be on the defendant to prove their innocence. Otherwise in a criminal trial the burden of proof usually rests with the prosecution. They must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. == Related pages == *Absolute defense *Lawsuit *Presumption of innocence *Criminal procedure *Statute of limitations *Adversarial system == References == Category:Legal terms",
