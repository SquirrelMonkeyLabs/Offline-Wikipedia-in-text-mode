 "text": "The Mount Oku forest tree toad (Wolterstorffina chirioi) is a toad. Scientists found it on Mount Okou in Cameroon. ==Home== These frogs live high on Mt. Okou where it is too high and cold for trees to grow but not so high that the snow never melts. This is called the mountain's alpine zone. Scientists saw it 3000 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this toad in one protected place, Mount Oku Faunal Reserve. ==Young== There are streams and springs on Mt. Okou, but scientists think that the toad does not lay eggs in them. They think this toad lives on land all its life. ==Danger== Scientists say this toad is in big danger of dying out. Human beings bring cows to eat grass in the alpine zone and set fires there so that the grass will grow in a way that is good for cows. Because the frog lives high in the hills, climate change could hurt it. Animals that live high on mountains cannot migrate somewhere colder if their home becomes too hot or dry; they would have to climb down to the low places first. ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
