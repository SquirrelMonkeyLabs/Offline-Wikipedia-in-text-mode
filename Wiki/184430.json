 "text": "Real analysis is an area of mathematics that deals with sets and sequences of real numbers, as well as functions of one or more real variables. It provides a rigorous logical foundation to calculus, the study of continuous change. As one of the main branches of mathematical analysis, it can be seen as the real- number counterpart of complex analysis, which deals with complex numbers. Many results in real analysis are special cases of results in complex analysis. == Related pages == * Derivative (mathematics) * Functional analysis == References == Category:Mathematical analysis",
