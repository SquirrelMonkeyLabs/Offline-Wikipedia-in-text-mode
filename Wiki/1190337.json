 "text": "Trigonal planar molecular geometry is a type of molecular geometry. An atom in a molecule has this geometry if it is connected by chemical bonds to three other atoms, which form an approximately equilateral triangle in the same plane as the central atom. If the central atom is not in the same plane as the outer atoms, it is trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry, and if the outer atoms form a right triangle, it is T-shaped molecular geometry. Trigonal planar molecular geometry usually occurs when the central atom has no lone pairs. In AXE notation, these are molecules. These molecules are usually Lewis acids. Category:Molecular geometry",
