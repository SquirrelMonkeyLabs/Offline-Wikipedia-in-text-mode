 "text": "This is a list of United States state legislatures. Each state in the United States has a legislature as part of its form of civil government. Most of the core details of the legislature are specified in the state constitution. With the exception of Nebraska, all state legislatures are bicameral bodies, which have a lower house (Assembly, General Assembly, State Assembly, House of Delegates, or House of Representatives) and an upper house (Senate). The United States also has one federal district and five non-state territories with local legislative branches, which are listed below. Among the states, the Nebraska Legislature is the only state with a unicameral body. However, three other jurisdictions the District of Columbia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands also have unicameral bodies. The exact names, dates, term lengths, term limits, electoral systems, electoral districts, and other details are determined by an individual state's laws. == Party summary == Party control of legislatures Republican 28 Democratic 18 Split 4 Total 50 Party control of state governments Republican trifecta 23 Democratic trifecta 15 Democratic governor/Republican legislature 5 Republican governor/Democratic legislature 3 Democratic governor/Split legislature 3 Republican governor/Split legislature 1 Total 50 Note: A party with the most amount of seats in a chamber may be forced to share power with other parties due to informal coalitions or may cede power outright because of disputes within its caucus. == State legislatures == State State executive Legislature name Lower house Upper house Name Size Party strength Term (yrs.)
