According to legend, when he spoke of the good life of King Dionysus, the king invited him to a banquet (large public meal). A sword was placed above Damocles, held up by a single thread. Damocles was scared of the sword, and felt that he could not enjoy his meal with it hanging above him. Dionysus said that this sword was a metaphor for the pressures put on those in public life, and that they must conduct themselves accordingly.Damocles, Britannica.com.
