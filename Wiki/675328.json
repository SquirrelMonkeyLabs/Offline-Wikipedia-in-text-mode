 "text": "The prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (, , ), is Congo's head of government. The current prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is Judith Suminwa Tuluka since 12 June 2024. The position of prime minister was already present in the first government after independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the first prime minister Patrice Emery Lumumba. The position was restored in 1977, as the title of \"First State Commissioner\" which, in reality, was weak in comparison to the pre-war office of Prime Minister. The office became vacant in 1997. ==Heads of government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1960–present)== (Dates in italics indicate de facto continuation of office) ===Republic of the Congo
