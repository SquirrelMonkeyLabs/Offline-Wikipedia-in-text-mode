 "text": "Sark is one of the Channel Islands. About 600 people live on Sark. Sark also has its own language called \"Sercquiais\". Only 400 people speak it. No cars are allowed on Sark. People must either walk, go on a bicycle, or go by horse and cart. Their parliament is called the Chief Pleas. It started in 1579. It manages its own health, education and transport. In 1993, the Barclay brothers bought the lease of the island of Brecqhou off the coast. They went to law to challenge the way the island was run. In 2007 they bought four of the islandâ€™s six hotels, one of the two pubs and one side of the main shopping street. They invested a lot of money. ==References== Category:Islands of the Channel Islands",
