 "text": "Tetney is a small village in Lincolnshire, England. ==Places== The village has a primary school, a pub called the Plough Inn, a fish and chip shop, a small village shop, a golf club, a garden centre, two churches and a village hall. The village hall is on the site of the playing fields which includes a cricket pitch, football pitch and, several years ago, a grass tennis court. ==Sports== Many successful local sports teams have played home games at the fields, namely Tetney United Football Club. The club had a tradition of using mainly Tetney based (or formerly Tetney based) players and was formed for this reason as Tetney Rovers FC were using many players from the towns and other villages. Players of note for the club included John \"Digger\" Shone, Stuart \"Wally\" Woods, Mick Foston (aka The White Feather), Lee \"Blinky\" Coulbeck and Andy \"Blade\" Glover. In later years the team was held together by the likes of Liam and Nick Carter, Paul & Oliver Genney, Neil \"Snowy\" Garton and Daniel \"Fat Pie\" Walker. The team also had seasons veterans such as Dave Whitehead and Paul 'Hamilton Stanbury' Price who were instrumental in the clubs greatest era of success winning several league titles and cups. Unfortunately the team was uncerimoniously disbanded several years ago. This was due to unfounded accusations by the local football authority. No football team has played from the village since. ==Marconi Beam Station== On the edge of the village is the site of a Marconi Beam Station from where telegrams were sent to Australia and India. When built it was state of the art. It is important in the history of telecommunications. Only the bases for the masts remain. The original administration buildings which are now a small industrial complex. ==References== ==Other websites== *Tetney Beam Station Category:Villages in Lincolnshire",
