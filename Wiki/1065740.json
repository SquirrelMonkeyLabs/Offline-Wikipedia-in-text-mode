 "text": "AEW All Out is a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). The event started in 2019 and is held in the August or September time slot of AEW's pay-per-view calendar, usually around Labor Day weekend. It is one of AEW's big five pay-per-views. The name \"All In\" was owned by Ring of Honor (ROH) at the time and AEW owner Tony Khan did not want to get sued, so he chose the name \"All Out\" for his pay-per-view. Khan would later purchase and own Ring of Honor. ==Dates and venues== Event Date City Venue Main event All Out (2019) August 31, 2019 Hoffman Estates, Illinois Sears Centre Arena Chris Jericho vs. Adam Page to crown the first AEW World Championship All Out (2020) September 5, 2020 Jacksonville, Florida Daily's Place Jon Moxley (c) vs. MJF for the AEW World Championship All Out (2021) September 5, 2021 Hoffman Estates, Illinois Now Arena Kenny Omega (c) vs. Christian Cage for the AEW World Championship.
