It was released on November 18, 2008 in North America and on November 21, 2008 in Europe. It was only released for the Nintendo DS. In the game, players use the tilt controls of the Nintendo DS to control their skater. Tricks can be done by flicking the DS. A second game was also included with it called Hue Pixel Painter. In that game, the player controls a blob and paint objects by rolling around them. ==Reception== The game was given negative reviews by game critics. Critics said that they did not like that the game didn't follow the motions of the DS movements most of the time, they said the animations were also bad and the game felt like a rushed product. ==References== Category:2008 video games Category:Tony Hawk video games Category:Activision video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Single-player video games Category:Skateboarding video games Category:Video game spin-offs",
