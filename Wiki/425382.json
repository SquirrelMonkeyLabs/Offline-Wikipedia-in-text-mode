 "text": "The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar (a number) that indicates how that matrix behaves. It can be calculated from the numbers in the matrix. The determinant of the matrix A is written as \\det(A) or |A| in a formula. Sometimes, instead of \\det\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}a&b;\\\\\\c&d;\\end{bmatrix}\\right) and \\left|\\begin{bmatrix}a&b;\\\\\\c&d;\\end{bmatrix}\\right|, one simply writes \\det\\begin{bmatrix}a&b;\\\\\\c&d;\\end{bmatrix} and \\left|\\begin{matrix}a&b;\\\\\\c&d;\\end{matrix}\\right|. ==Interpretation== There are a few ways to understand what the determinant says about a matrix. ===Geometric interpretation=== An n \\times n matrix can be seen as describing a linear map in n dimensions. In which case, the determinant indicates the factor by which this matrix scales (grows or shrinks) a region of n-dimensional space. For example, a 2 \\times 2 matrix A, seen as a linear map, will turn a square in 2-dimensional space into a parallelogram. That parallellogram's area will be \\det(A) times as big as the square's area. In the same way, a 3 \\times 3 matrix B, seen as a linear map, will turn a cube in 3-dimensional space into a parallelepiped. That parallelepiped's volume will be \\det(B) times as big as the cube's volume. The determinant can be negative or zero. A linear map can stretch and scale a volume, but it can also reflect it over an axis. Whenever this happens, the sign of the determinant changes from positive to negative, or from negative to positive. A negative determinant means that the volume was mirrored over an odd number of axes. ===\"System of equations\" interpretation=== One can think of a matrix as describing a system of linear equations. That system has a unique non-trivial solution exactly when the determinant is not 0 (non-trivial meaning that the solution is not just all zeros). If the determinant is zero, then there is either no unique non-trivial solution, or there are infinitely many. ==Singular matrices== A matrix has an inverse matrix exactly when the determinant is not 0. For this reason, a matrix with a non-zero determinant is called invertible. If the determinant is 0, then the matrix is called non- invertible or singular. Geometrically, one can think of a singular matrix as \"flattening\" the parallelepiped into a parallelogram, or a parallelogram into a line. Then the volume or area is 0, which means that there is no linear map that will bring the old shape back. ==Calculating a determinant== There are a few ways to calculate a determinant. ===Formulas for small matrices=== *For 1 \\times 1 and 2 \\times 2 matrices, the following simple formulas hold: :\\det\\begin{bmatrix}a\\end{bmatrix} = a,\\qquad\\det\\begin{bmatrix}a&b;\\\\\\c&d;\\end{bmatrix} = ad-bc. *For 3 \\times 3 matrices, the formula is: :{\\det\\begin{bmatrix}a&b;&c;\\\\\\d&e;&f;\\\\\\g&h;&i;\\end{bmatrix} = {\\color{blue}{aei}+{dhc}+{gbf}}{\\color{OrangeRed}{}-{gec}-{ahf}-{dbi}}} :One can use the Rule of Sarrus (see image) to remember this formula. ===Cofactor expansion=== For larger matrices, the determinant is harder to calculate. One way to do it is called cofactor expansion. Suppose that we have an n \\times n matrix A. First, we choose any row or column of the matrix. For each number a_{ij} in that row or column, we calculate something called its cofactor C_{ij}. Then \\det(A) = \\sum a_{ij} C_{ij}. To compute such a cofactor C_{ij}, we erase row i and column j from the matrix A. This gives us a smaller (n-1)\\times(n-1) matrix. We call it M. The cofactor C_{ij} then equals (-1)^{i+j} \\det(M). Here is an example of a cofactor expansion of the left column of a 3 \\times 3 matrix: \\begin{align} \\det \\begin{bmatrix}{\\color{red}1}&3&2\\\\\\\\{\\color{red}2}&1&1\\\\\\\\{\\color{red}0}&3&4\\end{bmatrix} &= {\\color{red}1} \\cdot C_{11} + {\\color{red}2} \\cdot C_{21} + {\\color{red}0} \\cdot C_{31} \\\\\\ &= \\left( {\\color{red}1} \\cdot (-1)^{1+1} \\det\\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\\\\\3&4\\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\+ \\left( {\\color{red}2} \\cdot (-1)^{2+1} \\det\\begin{bmatrix}3&2\\\\\\3&4\\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\+ \\left( {\\color{red}0} \\cdot (-1)^{3+1} \\det\\begin{bmatrix}3&2\\\\\\1&1\\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\\\\\ &= ({\\color{red}1} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) + ({\\color{red}2} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 6) + {\\color{red}0} \\\\\\ &= -11. \\end{align} As illustrated above, one can simplify the computation of determinant by choosing a row or column that has many zeros; if a_{ij} is 0, then one can skip calculating C_{ij} altogether. ==Related pages== *Invertible matrix *Volume == References == Category:Linear algebra",
