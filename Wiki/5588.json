 "text": "Somerset is a county in South West England. The main town of Somerset was Somerton, but it is now Taunton. There are two cities in Somerset. They are Bath and Wells. ==History== The name \"Somerset\" comes from the Anglo-Saxon phrase Sumorsaete, which was used to describe people from Somerton. In the past, the northern border of Somerset was the River Avon. However, as the city of Bristol has grown, the border moved south. In 1974 parts of north Somerset, the city of Bristol and parts of south Gloucestershire were joined into a new county. This county was named Avon. In 1996 Avon was split into 4 parts, which are now unitary authorities. People usually say that 2 of these parts (named North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset) are part of Somerset, even though they have their own councils. The oldest prison in England which is still used is in a town named Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Somerset also has the world's oldest road which people built. It is called the Sweet Track; it was built in about 3800 BC. ==Industry and tourism== There is not much large industry in Somerset, but Bridgwater is a port, and Yeovil is important in building helicopters. Tourism is an important industry in the county; in 2001 about 23,000 people worked in tourism. Tourists like Somerset because it is very beautiful, with much countryside and few big towns. Somerset has many places to visit: * Part of the Exmoor National Park is in Somerset. * Another popular place is Glastonbury, which has a popular music festival every year. * The Cheddar Gorge has caves which are popular with visitors, and locally made cheese. Farming is an important industry in Somerset, but not as many people work in this industry today. Somerset is famous for its cider (an alcoholic apple drink) and it has many apple orchards. ===Interesting places in Somerset=== * Bath Abbey * Bristol Channel * Burrow Hill Cider Farm * Cadbury Castle * Cheddar Gorge * Chew Valley Lake * Clifton Suspension Bridge * Dunster Castle * East Somersest Railway * Exmoor * Fussell Iron Works * Gartell Light Railway * Georgian Bath * Glastonbury Abbey * Glastonbury Tor * Ham Hill * Kennet and Avon Canal * Mendip Hills * Montacute House * River Avon, Bristol * River Chew * Roman Baths * Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway * Somerset Levels * Stanton Drew * Taunton Stop Line * Wells Cathedral * West Somerset Railway * Wookey Hole ==Politics== ===Districts of Somerset=== The numbers on the map are linked to the numbers below. # South Somerset # Taunton Deane # West Somerset # Sedgemoor # Mendip # Bath and North East Somerset (Unitary) # North Somerset (Unitary) == Cities, towns, and villages == This is a list of the main towns and cities in Somerset: * Bath * Bishops Hull * Bishops Lydeard * Bridgwater * Brympton * Burnham-on-Sea * Chard * Cheddar * Comeytrowe * Crewkerne * Frome * Glastonbury * Ilminster * Martock * Meare * Minehead * North Petherton * Shepton Mallet * Somerton * South Petherton * Street * Taunton * Watchet * Wellington * Wells * Weston-super-Mare * Wincanton * Yeovil == Other websites == * BBC Somerset * Somerset County Council * Bath and North East Somerset Council * North Somerset Council * Travel Information Category:Ceremonial counties of England",
