 "text": "The American Athletic Conference (also known as \"The American\" or \"AAC\") is a big college sports conference in the United States. Its members play in NCAA Division I. In football, they play in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; known before 2006 as Division I-A), the higher of two levels of Division I football. The American has its roots in the original Big East Conference. That conference was started in 1979 as a basketball-first league by a group of schools in the Eastern U.S. The Big East added football in 1991. That led to years of conflict between schools that played I-A/FBS football and those that did not. In July 2013, the Big East split into two conferences. The seven schools that did not play FBS football left to form a new Big East Conference. The FBS schools that did not go to other conferences stayed in the old conference structure. Along with several new members, they began operating as the American Athletic Conference. The American kept the original Big East charter. That makes it the legal successor of the old Big East. However, both The American and the new Big East claim 1979 as their founding dates. Both also claim the pre-split history of the old Big East, at least in corporate terms. However, both leagues agreed that the current Big East would maintain the sporting history of the original conference in most sports. The only exceptions are football and women's rowing, the only two sports sponsored by The American but not the current Big East. In those two sports, neither offshoot league recognizes the history of the original Big East. Of the 14 current full members (those that house most of their sports in the league), only Wichita State does not have a football team. A major conference realignment was triggered in 2021 when Big 12 Conference mainstays Oklahoma and Texas announced they would move to the Southeastern Conference no later than 2025, with a 2024 entry date later confirmed. The American would be heavily affected. The Big 12 then raided The American, inviting Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF to join that conference, with their arrival date later set for 2023. In turn, The American raided Conference USA, inviting six members of that conference to move to The American in 2023—Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, North Texas, Rice, UAB, and UTSA. Later in the realignment cycle, SMU announced it would leave The American for the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2024. The American replaced SMU for football with Army, which joined as a football-only member at the same time that SMU left. == Members == School Location Founded Type (affiliation) Nickname Joined The American (Charlotte) Charlotte, North Carolina 1946 Public 49ers 2023 East Carolina University Greenville, North Carolina 1907 Public Pirates 2014 Florida Atlantic University Boca Raton, Florida 1965 Public Owls 2023 MemphisUniversity of Memphis Memphis, Tennessee 1912 Public Tigers 2013 Denton, Texas 1890 Public Mean Green 2023 Rice University Houston, Texas 1912 Private Owls 2023 South FloridaUniversity of South Florida Tampa, Florida 1956 Public Bulls 2005 Temple University Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 1884 State- related Owls 1991, 2012 (football) 2013 (all sports) Tulane University New Orleans, Louisiana 1834 Private (nonsectarian) Green Wave 2014 TulsaUniversity of Tulsa Tulsa, Oklahoma 1894 Private (Presbyterian) Golden Hurricane 2014 (UAB) Birmingham, Alabama 1969 Public Blazers 2023 (UTSA) San Antonio, Texas 1969 Public Roadrunners 2023 Wichita State University Wichita, Kansas 1895 Public Shockers 2017 ===Associate members=== As of the 2024–25 school year, The American has six \"associate members\" that play one or two sports in the conference.

Before 2013, both had been members of the original Big East. A third school left The American in 2020 to rejoin most of its historic all-sports rivals in the current Big East. Three more schools left for the Big 12 in 2023, one of which stayed in The American for one season in women's lacrosse only. Another left for the ACC in 2024.

Three of these competed in women's rowing before leaving the conference, with one leaving after The American shut down its women's rowing league in 2024. Another women's rowing associate left in 2024, but is still in The American in another sport. Two other schools were members for women's lacrosse before the Big 12 Conference started a women's lacrosse league in 2024–25. One of these latter two schools had been a full American Conference member before joining the Big 12, but kept women's lacrosse in The American for a single season. Apart from these, five other schools were associate members for one year before becoming full conference members.
