 "text": "The Road Warriors, also known as the Legion of Doom, were a professional wrestling tag team. They competed in many different professional wrestling promotions. They were known for competing in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E). The team's original members were Hawk and Animal. ==Career== They were joined by their manager \"Precious\" Paul Ellering. Droz joined the team after an angle happened that was based off of Road Warrior Hawk’s real life alcohol and drug issues. The angle even went so far as to fake a suicide jump off the top of the TitanTron. The angle bombed and both members said that they disliked it and left the WWF in 1999. Their last TV appearance as a team was on the May 12, 2003 episode of Raw when they faced World Tag Team Champions Rob Van Dam and Kane. Hawk died on October 19, 2003 from a heart attack. Animal returned to the WWE in 2005 and teamed with Heidenreich. They won the WWE Tag Team Championship after defeating MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) at The Great American Bash on July 24, 2005. Heidenreich became an official member of the Legion of Doom on August 18, 2005. They were also manged by Christy Hemme during that time. They lost the tag team titles on the October 28, 2005 edition of SmackDown! to MNM in a Fatal Four-Way tag team match that also featured Paul Burchill and William Regal and The Mexicools (Super Crazy and Psicosis). Heidenreich was released from WWE on January 17, 2006 and Animal was released a few months later. On April 2, 2011, The Road Warriors, along with Paul Ellering, were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Dusty Rhodes. Animal died on September 22, 2020, also from a heart attack. == Championships and accomplishments == === Road Warriors / Legion of Doom / LOD 2000 === * All Japan Pro Wrestling ** NWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) * American Wrestling Association ** AWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) * Cauliflower Alley Club ** Tag Team Award (2020) * Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling ** World Japan Tag Team Championship (1 time) * Georgia Championship Wrestling ** NWA National Tag Team Championship (3 times) ** NWA National Tag Team Championship Tournament (1984) * Hardcore Hall of Fame ** Class of 2021 * International Wrestling Superstars ** IWS World Tag Team Championship (1 time) * i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling ** i-Generation Tag Team Championship (3 times) * Independent Pro Wrestling ** IPW Tag Team Championship (1 time) * Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling ** NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (3 times) – with Dusty Rhodes (2) and Genichiro Tenryu (1) ** NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-Atlantic version) (1 time) ** Iron Team Tournament (1989) ** Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup (1986) * Memphis Wrestling Hall of Fame ** Class of 2022 * National Wrestling Alliance ** NWA Hall of Fame (Class of 2012) ** NWA Wrestling Legends Hall of Heroes (2016) * Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum ** Class of 2011 (Animal, Hawk, and Ellering) * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** PWI Tag Team of the Year (1983–1985, 1988) ** PWI Feud of the Year (1987) with Dusty Rhodes and Nikita Koloff vs. the Four Horsemen ** PWI ranked them #1 of the 100 best tag teams during the \"PWI Years\" in 2003 * Quebec Wrestling Hall of Fame ** Class of 2015 * Super World of Sports ** One Night Tag Team Tournament (1991) * Tokyo Sports ** Best Foreigner Award (1985) * World Wrestling Federation/WWE ** WWF Tag Team Championship (2 times) ** WWE Hall of Fame (Class of 2011) * Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards ** Rookies of the Year (1983) ** Tag Team of the Year (1984) ** Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 1996) === Hell Raisers === * New Japan Pro-Wrestling ** IWGP Tag Team Championship (2 times) * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** PWI ranked them #58 of the 100 best tag teams of the \"PWI Years\" in 2003 === LOD 2005 === * World Wrestling Entertainment ** WWE Tag Team Championship (1 time) === Hell Warriors === * Toryumon Mexico ** UWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) ==References== ==Other websites== *The Road Warriors' profile on WWE.com Category:New Japan Pro-Wrestling teams and stables Category:World Championship Wrestling teams and stables Category:WWE teams and stables Category:WWE Hall of Fame",
