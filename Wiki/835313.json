It was discovered by accident in 1928 together with the Ugaritic texts. Its ruins are often called Ras ShamraSometimes written \"Ras Shamrah\"; , literally \"Cape Fennel\"). See . due to the headland on which they are found. Ugarit had close connections to the Hittite Empire. It also sent tribute to Egypt at times and maintained trade and diplomatic connections with Cyprus (then called Alashiya). This is documented in the archives recovered from the site. It is confirmed by Mycenaean and Cypriot pottery found there. The polity was at its height from c. 1450 BCE until its destruction in c. 1200 BCE. This destruction was possibly caused by the mysterious Sea Peoples or internal struggle. The kingdom would be one of the many that fell apart during the Bronze Age Collapse. == References == Category:Archaeological sites in Syria Category:Phoenician colonies",
