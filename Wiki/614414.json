He lived in Mevaseret Zion and taught literature at Ben Gurion University of the Negev and was often writing in Jerusalem's Ticho House (Beit Ticho). In 2007, Appelfeld's Badenheim 1939 was adapted for the stage and performed at the Gerard Behar Center in Jerusalem. In 1941, when he was nine years old, the Romanian Army retook his hometown after a year of Soviet occupation and his mother was murdered. Appelfeld was deported with his father to a Nazi concentration camp in Romanian-controlled Transnistria. He escaped and hid for three years before joining the Soviet army as a cook. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:Holocaust survivors Category:Academics of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Category:Israeli novelists Category:Naturalized citizens of Israel Category:European novelists Category:Romanian Jews",
