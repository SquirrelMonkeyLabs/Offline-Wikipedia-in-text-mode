In September of the same year, the first product of the subsidiary was launched in the form of the Chery QQ3EV, an electric variant of the QQ3, which remained the only product of the division until the end of the second decade of the 21st century. In 2014, the QQ3EV replaced the more modern eQ based on the next generation of the city hatchback, and only 3 years later the range was expanded with other products. First, it was the electric equivalent of Tiggo 3x, the crossover Tiggo 3xe, and with it - also based on the existing sedan model Arrizo 5e. In the same year, Chery New Energy presented the first model developed from scratch without a combustion engine counterpart in the form of a small hatchback eQ1. In 2019, the latest product to be added was an electric-only variant of the existing Chery model in the form of the crossover Tiggo e. At the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, Chery New Energy began expanding its portfolio with designs built from the ground up with electric drive in mind, starting with the large crossover eQ5. In August 2021, the QQ Ice Cream microcar was introduced in response to the popularity of the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV. == Products == ===Current models=== * Chery Arrizo e (2021–present), compact Car * Chery eQ7 (2023–present), compact SUV * Chery eQ1 (2017–present), city car * Chery QQ Ice Cream (2021–present), city car File:Chery QQ Ice Cream IMG01.jpg|Chery QQ Ice Cream File:2022 Chery eQ1 (facelift, front).jpg|Chery eQ1 File:2023 Chery EQ7.jpg|Chery eQ7 === Former models === * QQ3EV (2010–2014) * eQ2 (2018) * eQ (2014–2020) * Tiggo 3xe (2018–2022) * Click here (2019–2022) * eQ5 (2020–2023) * Wujie Pro (2022–2023) File:2018 Chery eQ, front 8.9.18.jpg|Chery eQ File:Chery Tiggo 3xe 002.jpg|Chery Tiggo 3xe File:Chery eQ5 019.jpg|Chery eQ5 File:Chery Wujie Pro 003.jpg|Chery Wujie Pro == References == Category:Electric automobile companies of China",
