Singapore lies north of the equator, south of the Malaysian state of Johor and north of Indonesia's Riau Islands and is in-between the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea. Singapore is one of the three true city-states in the world, along with Monaco and the Vatican City, and is the only one with full self-governance, its own currency, and a significant military force.
