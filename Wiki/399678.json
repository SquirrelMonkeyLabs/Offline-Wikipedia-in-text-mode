While gangsta rap came with its dark and violent themes in the 1990s, comedy rap came with its very light and very humorous themes in the 1980s. While very few rappers make comedy rap their focus, it still keeps its royalties with hip hop. ==Notable artists== * Eminem * Hopsin * Eamon * Weird Al Yankovic * The Lonely Island * Lil Dicky * Biz Markie * Afroman * Bo Burnham * Goldie Lookin' Chain * DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince Category:Hip hop genres Category:Rap music",
