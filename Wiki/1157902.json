 "text": "On 14 December 2024, Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, was impeached by the National Assembly. This came in response to Yoon's declaration of martial law on 3 December 2024, which was overturned by the National Assembly and officially ended six hours later on 4 December 2024. Former prime minister Han Duck-soo became acting president until the Constitutional Court's decision on whether to remove Yoon from office. An earlier impeachment motion was put to a parliamentary vote on 7 December 2024 but failed because the number of attending legislators did not meet the needed number for it to pass. This is the third impeachment of a South Korean president: Roh Moo-hyun was impeached in 2004 but acquitted by the Constitutional Court, while Park Geun-hye was impeached in 2016 and convicted and removed from office in 2017 after the Constitutional Court's confirmation. On 31 December, the Seoul Western District Court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon with charges relating to abuse of power, and orchestrating the 2024 South Korean martial law crisis. On 4 April 2025, an eight-judge Constitutional Court supported Yoon's impeachment, formally removing him from office. This made him the shortest-serving president in South Korea's democratic history. ==References== Category:December 2024 events Category:2024 in South Korea Yoon Suk Yeol Category:April 2025 events",
