 "text": "The Carolinas are the U.S. states of North Carolina and South Carolina. They were both part of the original Thirteen Colonies, which gained independence from the British Empire in 1783. During the colonial period, the southern portion of the Carolinas was primarily a support for the British West Indies; where thousands upon thousands of slaves were brought in to feed the growing trade. The same could not be said about the northern part of the region, which was a sparsely populated area, mostly inhabited by decommissioned servants from the Chesapeake area, many of whom set up small tobacco farms. ==References== Category:Divided regions Category:Geography of North Carolina Category:Geography of South Carolina",
