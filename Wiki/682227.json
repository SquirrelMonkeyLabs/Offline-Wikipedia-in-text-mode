 "text": "The NXT UK Tag Team Championship was a men's professional wrestling title owned by WWE and competed for by tag teams of NXT UK. It was created on June 18, 2018, during the first night of the 2018 United Kingdom Championship Tournament. There was an announcement during the tournament that another 4-team tournament would happen and it would decide the first NXT UK Tag Team Champions. The semi-finals of this tournament happened in November 2018 and the final happened in January 2019. There, Grizzled Young Veterans (James Drake and Zack Gibson) beat Moustache Mountain (Tyler Bate and Trent Seven) to become the first champions. In August 2022, WWE announced that the NXT UK brand would end and restart as NXT Europe at a later time. So the NXT UK Tag Team Championship was retired on 4 September 2022 at Worlds Collide. At the event, Pretty Deadly (Elton Prince and Kit Wilson) defeated NXT Tag Team Champions The Creed Brothers (Brutus Creed and Julius Creed), Gallus (Mark Coffey and Wolfgang), and reigning champions Brooks Jensen and Josh Briggs in a fatal four-way tag team elimination match to make the NXT UK Tag Team Championship into one with the NXT Tag Team Championship. Jensen and Briggs are listed as the last NXT UK Tag Team Champions. Pretty Deadly went on as the unified NXT Tag Team Champions. == Tournament == == Reigns == == Notes == ==References== ==Other websites== *Official NXT UK Tag Team Championship title history Category:World Wrestling Entertainment championships",
