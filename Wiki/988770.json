 "text": "Poetry is a magazine that prints poems. It was started in 1912 by Harriet Monroe in Chicago, Illinois. From its beginning the magazine published poetry that was often different from most poetry of that time. Some of the poems were seen as experiments. In her first words to readers, Harriet Monroe said she wanted \"to print the best English verse which is being written today, regardless of where, by whom, or under what theory of art it is written.\" The magazine published the early works of H.D., Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Marianne Moore. The magazine discovered poets such as Gwendolyn Brooks, James Merrill, and John Ashbery. Some other famous writers who have had works published in Poetry are: William Butler Yeats, Rabindranath Tagore, William Carlos Williams, T. S. Eliot, Joyce Kilmer, Carl Sandburg, Robert Creeley, Wallace Stevens, Basil Bunting, Dorothy Richardson, Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, E. E. Cummings, Frank O'Hara, Allen Ginsberg, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and Tennessee Williams. The magazine always wanted to pay poets for their work, but having enough money to keep the magazine going was often a problem for most of its history. Many people gave money. In 2002, Ruth Lilly (a drug company heiress) gave more than 100 million dollars to the magazine. This keeps the magazine running and lets the magazine give many grants and prizes to poets and other writers. ==References== Category:American magazines Category:Poetry",
