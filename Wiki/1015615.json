 "text": "The Burmese bug-eyed frog, Burmese warted tree frog, or Tenasserim warty tree frog (Theloderma phrynoderma) is a frog. It lives in Myanmar and Thailand. This frog lives in forests with at least some evergreen trees in low places and on mountains. People have also seen this frog in bamboo forests. Scientists think it hatches out of its egg as a tadpole and not a small frog, but they are not sure. The female frog lays eggs in holes in trees that have water in them, in puddles on rocks, and other places where the water does not move. People have seen this frog between 59 and 1400 meters above sea level. It lives in at least one protected park, Tanintharyi Nature Reserve, and they think it lives in other parks too. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. People cut down the forests where it lives to make farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
