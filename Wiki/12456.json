 "text": "Chicken is a hen which refers to a species of poultry. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Some breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around). A male chicken is called a cock or a rooster. A female chicken is called a hen. A young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. Chicks hatch out of the eggs. When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes, coyotes, and hawks too. Fences are often used for this.How to Raise Chickens , retrieved 15 March 2011.
