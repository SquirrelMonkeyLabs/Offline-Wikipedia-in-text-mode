 "text": "Ann Zhang (born 21 June 1957) is a retired Chinese short track athlete and coach. She was the coach of the Australian short track team from 1996 to 2014. Zhang Yuanyuan was born in Beijing on 21 June 1957. Zhang, living in Brisbane, Australia, began her coaching career as the junior coach of the New South Wales selection in 1992. Four years later she was promoted to become the Australia national coach. At that time, the country's short track team had already achieved considerable success, including the first medal for Australia at the Winter Olympics, a bronze medal in the relay at the Games in Lillehammer in 1994. After Zhang took over the team, an Australian short tracker was able to finish fourth in the Short Track World Cup in 1996. Zhang achieved her greatest successes as a coach at the Olympic Games. The short track team was successful in the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. Very surprisingly, Steven Bradbury won the first Winter Olympics gold medal for his country. == Other websites == * Category:Sportswomen Category:1957 births Category:Chinese sportspeople Category:Australian sportspeople Category:Speed skaters",
