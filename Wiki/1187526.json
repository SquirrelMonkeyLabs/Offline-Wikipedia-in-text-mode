 "text": "The Second White Terror occurred in France in 1815â€“1816, following the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815) and the enthronement of Louis XVIII as King of France after the Hundred Days. Suspected sympathizers of the French Revolution (including former Jacobins), Republicans, Bonapartists and, to a minor degree, Protestants, suffered persecution. Several hundred were killed by angry mobs or executed after a quick trial at a drumhead court-martial.Gwynn Lewis, \"The White Terror of 1815 in the Department of the Gard: Counter-Revolution, Continuity and the Individual\" Past & Present No. 58 (Feb., 1973), pp. 108-135 online == References ==",
