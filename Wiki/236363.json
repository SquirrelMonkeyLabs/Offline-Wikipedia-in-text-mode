Napoleon I of France was wed by proxy marriage to Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. Catherine of Aragon wed Prince Arthur by proxy. A famous 17th-century painting by Peter Paul Rubens shows the proxy marriage of Marie de Medici. Today, this form of marriage is illegal in most countries, or it requires a special permit.
