 "text": "The 2009 WWE Draft took place April 13, 2009 at the Phillips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. It was the sixth yearly draft and the seventh overall. The WWE draft is run by World Wrestling Entertainment. It is a way to add to their rosters after separating into two separate rosters (Raw and SmackDown!) in 2002. This is known as the WWE Brand Extension. ECW was added as WWE's third brand in 2006. Under the brand extension, superstars are brand exclusive. This means they belong to and perform on brand. A brand uses its brand's show to perform. For example, SmackDown Superstars perform on SmackDown. The draft was shown on an episode of Raw. ==Selections== Pick # Brand (to) Employee Role Brand (from) Raw Montel Vontavious Porter Male wrestler SmackDown Raw The Big Show Male wrestler SmackDown SmackDown Melina Female wrestler Raw Raw Matt Hardy Male wrestler SmackDown Raw Triple H Male wrestler SmackDown SmackDown CM Punk Male wrestler Raw Raw The Miz Male wrestler ECW SmackDown Kane Male wrestler Raw SmackDown Chris Jericho Male wrestler Raw 10 ECW Vladimir Kozlov Male wrestler SmackDown 11 Raw Maryse Female wrestler SmackDown 12 SmackDown Rey Mysterio Male wrestler Raw == References == 2009 Category:2009 in professional wrestling Category:2009 in the United States Category:2000s in Atlanta, Georgia Category:April 2009 events pl:WWE Draft#WWE Draft 2009",
