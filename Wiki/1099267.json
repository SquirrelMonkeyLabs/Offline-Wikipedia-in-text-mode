 "text": "The Pamir Mountains are a range of mountains between South-central Asia. They are located at a junction with other notable mountains, namely the Tian Shan, Karakoram, Kunlun, Hindu Kush and the Himalaya mountain ranges. They are among the world's highest mountains. Much of the Pamir Mountains lie in the Gorno- Badakhshan Province of Tajikistan.According to the Big Soviet Encyclopedia \"The question of the natural boundaries of Pamir is debatable. Normally Pamir is regarded as covering the territory from Trans-Alay Range to the north, Sarykol Range to the east, Lake Zorkul, Pamir River, and the upper reaches of Panj River to the south, and the meridional section of the Panj valley to the west; to the north-west Pamir includes the eastern parts of Peter the Great and Darvaz ranges.\" To the south, they border the Hindu Kush mountains along Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in Badakhshan Province, Chitral and Gilgit- Baltistan region of Pakistan. Since Victorian times, they have been known as the \"Roof of the World\", presumably a translation from Persian. ==Notes== == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Asia Category:Geography of Afghanistan Category:Geography of China Category:Geography of Kyrgyzstan Category:Mountain ranges of Pakistan Category:Geography of Tajikistan",
