 "text": ":Not to be confused with Afghan National Anthem. \"Surudi Milli\" (, , meaning \"National Anthem\") is the name of the national anthem of Tajikistan. It became the country's national anthem in 1994. ==History== Tajikistan is a Persian- speaking country in southern Central Asia that used to be part of the former Soviet Union. Like all Republics of the Soviet Union, each regional republic had their own anthem. Some of those former Soviet republics kept their anthem's tune in their modern-day post-Soviet national anthems, as independent countries. Tajikistan is one of them. The tune of Tajikistan's national anthem is based on that of the Anthem of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, which was composed by a Bukharan Jewish composer named Sulaymon Yudakov, and the words to that song was written by an Iranian-Soviet poet named Abulqosim Lohuti.Tajikistan (1946–1994) After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tajikistan became a newly independent country. Unlike other then newly independent former Soviet republics, which all either replaced their old anthem with a new one or at least changed the words to reflect their independence, Tajikistan did not. Even when the USSR was no more, Tajikistan was still using the Soviet-era anthem. It wasn't until three years later, in 1994, the sovereign government wanted to change the words, in order to reflect the country's independence. A Tajik poet named Gulnazar Keldi wrote the new words to their national anthem. It was then when the words of the Soviet-era anthem was dropped, and were replaced with his new words. However, the Tajikistani national anthem still uses the same tune composed by Yudakov, that was used for the Soviet-era anthem. It remains the national anthem to this day. ==Lyrics== Official text IPA transcription Bukhori alphabet Roman alphabet English translation Our country so beloved, Happy we are to see your dignity.
