He was descended from the Marduntjara and Pitjantjatjara nations of Central Australia. He was taken away from his mother as a child and was taught at a Christian mission in Adelaide. Briscoe played football (soccer) for Adelaide in the South Australian league. He played alongside his schoolmate Charles Perkins. In 1958, he moved to England with the hope of playing professional football. He had small jobs with Barnet and Preston North End, but he did not make a first team appearance. He went back to Australia at the suggestion of Perkins. The two of them later played recreational football with the Australian National University from 1968 to about 1972. Briscoe began studying at ANU in 1981. His focus was on the indigenous history of Australia. He was involved in the production of the SBS documentary First Australians. He got his PhD in 1997. Briscoe also worked as an activist for indigenous Australians. He was involved in the establishment of the Aboriginal Progress Association in the 1950s, the Aboriginal Legal Service in the 1960s and the Aboriginal Medical Service in 1972. == References == Category:1938 births Category:2023 deaths Category:Indigenous Australian activists Category:Indigenous Australian politics Category:Australian men's soccer players Category:Order of Australia Category:Pitjantjatjara Category:People from Alice Springs Category:Indigenous Australian sportspeople",
