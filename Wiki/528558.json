 "text": "Bloons Tower Defense (also known as Bloons TD or BTD) are a series of tower- defense games that were created by Ninja Kiwi. The focus of the games is to use towers to defeat an enemy called Bloons to progress through the game. As you play the game, the Bloons become more difficult to defeat. Players are able to upgrade their towers to help defeat stronger enemies. Bloons can come with power ups, such as camouflage and regeneration. Most of the Tower Defense games can be played on computers and mobile/tablets. == Main Entries == Bloons TD 1 began in 2007. In every new entry of the main Bloons series, there are many new game mechanics. Some games are spinoffs of the original series. For example, Bloons TD Battles. == Pricing == On mobile, all of the Bloons Tower Defense Games (except Bloons Monkey City and Bloons TD 3, which are free on the App Store) cost $2.99 to play and download. A free game is also on their website. Some of the Bloons games have lite versions, such as Bloons TD or Bloons TD 4, which are free to play, but have limitations. == Bloons == The enemies of the series are \"Bloons\". (The trademarked word Bloons is a spinoff of the word \"balloons\".) Once the Bloons come, a monkey will have to be placed to pop them. These monkeys pop the bloons. Red Bloons release no \"children\". B.A.Ds also have no \"parents\". Children & parents are terms determining what Bloons release when pop (children) and what Bloon releases that Bloon (parents). For example, the child of a Blue Bloon is a Red Bloon, and the parent of a Blue Bloon is a Green Bloon. == Towers == In Bloons, there are a lot of towers. There are many kinds of towers. Most are monkeys, and some are machines. All towers can be upgraded to improve their performance and abilities. == Bloons Tower Defense Games == * Bloons Adventure Time TD * Bloons Monkey City Flash * Bloons Monkey City Mobile * Bloons TD (DSi ware) * Bloons TD 1 * Bloons TD 2 * Bloons TD 3 * Bloons TD 4 * Bloons TD 4 (DSi) * Bloons TD 4 Expansion * Bloons TD 4 HD Lite * Bloons TD 4 Mobile * Bloons TD 5 * Bloons TD 5 Console * Bloons TD 5 Deluxe * Bloons TD 5 Flash * Bloons TD 5 Mac * Bloons TD 5 Mobile * Bloons TD 5 Steam * Bloons TD 6 * Bloons TD 6+ * Bloons TD Battles 2 * Bloons TD Battles Flash * Bloons TD Battles Mobile * Bloons TD Battles Steam * Bloons TD Mobile * Bloons Tower Defense * Bloons Tower Defense (PSN) * Bloons Tower Defense 2 * Bloons Tower Defense 3 * Bloons Tower Defense 5 HD == Popularity == The Bloons Tower Defense series has been a top seller on the Apple app store.
