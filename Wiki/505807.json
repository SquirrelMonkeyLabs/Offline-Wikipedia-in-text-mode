 "text": "The volcanoes of Kamchatka are a large group of volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts. There are about 160 volcanoes, 29 of them still active. They are in the six UNESCO World Heritage List sites in the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, most of them on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The highest volcano is Klyuchevskaya Sopka (4,750 m or 15,584 ft), the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere.Press Releases - Public Affairs Office - The University of Nottingham The most striking is Kronotsky, whose perfect cone was said by volcanologists Robert and Barbara Decker to be a prime candidate for the world's most beautiful volcano.Robert Decker & Barbara Decker 2005. Volcanoes. San Francisco: Freeman, 4th ed. ISBN 978-0716789291 (general reference only) In the center of Kamchatka is Eurasia's world famous Geyser Valley which was partly destroyed by a massive mudslide in June 2007. Deep seismic events and tsunamis are fairly common. Intense volcanism is caused by the subduction of the Pacific Plate.The Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath the Okhotsk Plate along the Kurilâ€“Kamchatka Trench A pair of huge earthquakes occurred off the coast on October 16, 1737, and on November 4, 1952, in magnitudes ~9.3 and 8.2 respectively. More shallow earthquakes were recorded as recently as April 2006. == References == Category:Volcanoes of Russia Category:Mountains of Russia Category:World Heritage Sites in Russia Category:Siberia",
