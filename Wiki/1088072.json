 "text": "Yahya ibn Zakariya (John, son of Zecariah) is a prophet in Islam, who was sent to the Children of Jacob to guide them. He is mentioned 5 times in the Quran. He is honored in Sufism due to his good character and kindness.Encyclopedia of Islam, Yahya ibn Zakkariya, Online web. Sufis claim that both Jesus and Yahya are similar due to both being given wisdom by God and phrases being similarly used to describe the prophets.Whereas the Quran itself gives blessings of peace to Yāhya (Quran 19:15), Jesus, in contrast, gives himself the blessings of peace. (Quran 19: 16–33) Various hadiths say he died without any sins and the Quran says he was blessed both on the day he was born and the day he died. == References == Category:Islam",
