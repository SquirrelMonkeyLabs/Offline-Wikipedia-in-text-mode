He had a career .263 Batting average, and 583 Home Runs. Although McGwire has never admitted to or been convicted of any steroid use, many of his accomplishments, particularly his historic home run surge late in his career, have come into question due to his connection to the steroid scandal in Major League Baseball. == Other websites == * Category:1963 births Category:American League All-Stars Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States Category:Baseball players from California Category:Living people Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:National League All- Stars Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Sportspeople from Pomona, California Category:St. Louis Cardinals players",
