 "text": "The farmland green tree frog (Zhangixalus arvalis) is a frog. It lives in Taiwan. These frogs live on and near farms, in bamboo forests, in fruit tree farms, sugar cane farms, and scrubby places. People have seen this frog 50 meters above sea level. This frog lays eggs in rain water. The female frog lays about 200 eggs at a time. The tadpoles become frogs about 40 days after they hatch. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives to make towns and because of bad chemicals from farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
