 "text": "The Arizona Coyotes are an inactive professional ice hockey team that used to play in the National Hockey League (NHL). They played in Tempe, Arizona until 2024 when they went inactive. ==History== In 1996, the team moved to Phoenix from Winnipeg, Canada, where they were known as the Jets. The team moved to the suburb of Glendale in December 2003. They have never won a Stanley Cup. Their head coach is Andr√© Tourigny and their general manager is Bill Armstrong. Wayne Gretzky resigned as head coach on September 14, 2009. In May 2009, the Coyotes filed for bankruptcy protection. They officially changed their name from the Phoenix Coyotes to the Arizona Coyotes on June 27, 2014. On April 10, 2024, it was reported that the Coyotes had permission from the NHL to look at relocation to Salt Lake City, Utah and that progress was being made. The NHL finalized the deal on April 18. If the state is able to build a new arena by 2029 then it will rejoin the NHL as an expansion team with all previous team history, records and uniforms being transfered to the team. After a land auction for a 110 acre parcel of land in North Phoenix was cancelled, Coyotes owner Alex Muruelo said that he didn't have any plans to seek more arena options for the team. This leaves the future of the team unknown. On June 25, it was announced that Meruelo would be walking away from ownership of the Coyotes. == References == ==Other websites== * Official website Category:1990s establishments in Arizona",
