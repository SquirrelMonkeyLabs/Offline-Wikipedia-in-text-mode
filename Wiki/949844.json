 "text": "On August 8, 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) performed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, the personal residence of former U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida. The search was about a safe owned by Trump that might have had classified documents from the White House when Trump was president. Trump was at Trump Tower in New York City during the search. The White House said that President Joe Biden did not know about the search before it happened. Many Republicans including Marco Rubio, Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Kevin McCarthy and some Democrats including Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Cuomo and Andrew Yang did not support the FBI raid and criticized the FBI. ==References== Category:2022 in Florida Category:August 2022 events Category:Donald Trump Category:Federal Bureau of Investigation",
