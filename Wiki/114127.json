 "text": "A social network is a website or service where people talk to or connect with other people. A Social Network Service can connect people with the same interests (like football, schools, dogs) and friends. Social Networking was first proposed in the early development of the World Wide Web. The most popular websites like Facebook and Twitter are helping to speed up the process of communication. Phone and mail services are slowly becoming less popular thanks to a quick and easy way of sharing messages through such networks. A social network is used for people to get to know each other more and create new friends/connections. Many social networks are available on phones and smartphones. A 2011 survey found that 47% of American adults use a social networking service. Hispanics and African Americans are more likely to use social media. Nigerians are more likely to spend more time on social media. African Americans often use social media more than any other ethnicity or racial group.
