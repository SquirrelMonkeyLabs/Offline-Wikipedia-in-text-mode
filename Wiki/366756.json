 "text": "Hinglaj Shakti Peeth is a place of worship and pilgrimage of Hindu religion. It is in Surendranagar District, in Kadasar village, Rajkot, Gujarat. It is also known by the names Hingdaj, Bhavani and Hingraj Mata. ==History== To stop the divine dance (Tandava) of Lord Shiva after the death of Dakshayani, Lord Vishnu scattered Shiva's remains over many places on the Indian subcontinent. It is said that the head fell at Hingula or Hinglaj. Because of this, this place is considered the most important of the 51 Shakti Peeths. At each of the Peeths, Bhairava (a manifestation of Shiva) accompanies the relics. The Bhairava at Hinglaj is called Bhimalochana. It is in Koteshwar, Kutch. The Sanskrit texts mention the part as 'Brahmadreya' or vital essence. Shri Hingdaj Mata brought from Pakistan (Balochistan) to Kadasar village. Kadasar is in Rajkot, Gujarat. Historically, this area is called Saurashtra. It is the worship place for Mata Hingdaj. One day, Harsidhhi Mata and Vikram Raja came to Hingdaj ‘Shakti Peeth’. ==Kuldevi== Hinglaj is worshiped as Kuldevi by many Kshatriya, Bhavsar, Barot and Rao of India. ==Temples== *Hinglaj Mata Temple also known as Hingdaj Mata, Hingraj Mata Temple in India. *Hinglaj Mata Temple in Mahesana (hinglajpura), Gujarat. *Shri Hinglaj Mata Temple at Rajula, Gujarat(MAHUVA RAJULA ROAD). *Hinglaj Mata Temple at Rajasthan, India. *Hinglaj Mata Temple at Pakistan (Balochistan) *Hinglaj Mata Temple at Tikamgarh, Madhya Pradesh *Hinglaj Mata Mandir (Bhuti)Takhatgarh, Rajasthan *Hinglaj Mata Mandir at Mumbai. *Shree Hinglaj Mata (Hingula Mata) Temple at Talcher, Orissa, Purihttps://www.flickr.com/photos/hinglajmataji/7976125066/in/photostream *Hingdaj Mataji temple at Bapunagar, Ahmedabad.https://www.flickr.com/photos/hinglajmataji/6943773986/in/photostream *Hinglaj mataji Temple at Ambada, India.https://www.flickr.com/photos/hinglajmataji/7089852825/in/photostream ==References== Category:Hindu temples Category:Gujarat",
