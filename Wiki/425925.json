Tyler created the hip-hop collective Odd Future in 2007, with some of his close friends, Hodgy, Left Brain, Casey Veggies and Jasper Dolphin. The group was known for their rebellious and inappropriate lyrics. They released their first mixtape in 2008. Tyler made his first album Bastard in 2009. He made the song Yonkers in 2011, getting a lot of attention from several media outlets. Tyler released his second album Goblin in 2011, known for its horrorcore aesthetic and lyrics.
