 "text": "The College of Saint Rose was a private, Catholic affiliated college in Albany, New York. The college was founded in 1920 and operated for over 100 years. It closed suddenly in June, 2024 after running out of money. This left many students unable to complete their degree programs and being forced to transfer. The College of Saint Rose expanded programs and campus buildings drastically between 2010 and 2015, which required a lot of funding. The enrollment was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-2022, likely playing a role in the closing of the college. The College of Saint Rose offered degree programs in many fields, including broadcasting, nursing, education, technology, art and others. ==References== Category:Albany, New York Category:Colleges and universities in New York (state)",
