 "text": "Erich von Tschermak-Seysenegg (15 November 1871 – October 11 1962) was an Austrian botanist. Von Tschermak is one of three men – the others were Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns – who were credited with independently rediscovering Gregor Mendel's work on genetics. Von Tschermak published his findings in June 1900. By a quirk of history, Correns had been a student of Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli. Nageli was a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas, but who failed to understand how significant Mendel's work was. Von Tschermak was a grandson of a man who taught Mendel botany during his student days in Vienna. == Reassessment == Though von Tschermak was originally also credited with the rediscovery, this is no longer generally accepted, because he did not understand Mendel's laws. == References == == Other websites == * Article relating the work of Gregor Mendel Category:1871 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Austrian botanists",
