 "text": "Maria I (English: Mary I) (17 December 1734 – 20 March 1816) was the Queen of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Known as Maria the Pious (in Portugal), or Maria the Mad (in Brazil), she was the first undisputed Queen (in her own right) of Portugal. Her court, then under the direction of her eldest son and heir Dom João, the Prince Regent, moved to the then Portuguese colony of Brazil. Later on, Brazil would be elevated from the rank of a colony to that of a Kingdom. This led to the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. ==Early life== Maria was born at the Ribeira Royal Palace in Lisbon. On the day of her birth, her grandfather, King João V, created her the Princess of Beira. She was the eldest of all her four siblings. When her father succeeded to the throne in 1750 as José I, Maria became his heiress presumptive and was given the traditional titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza. She was also an Infanta of Portugal from birth and thus entitled to the style of Royal Highness. She grew up during the dominating Marquis of Pombal ==Marriage== In 1760 Maria married her uncle Pedro, younger brother of her father Jose I.António Henrique R. de Oliveira Marques, History of Portugal: From Lusitania to empire (New York: Columbia University Press, 1972), p. 424 They had six children, of whom the eldest surviving son succeeded Maria as João VI on her death in 1816. === Titles and Styles === * 17 December 1734 – 31 July 1750 Her Royal Highness The Princess of Beira, Duchess of Barcelos * 31 July 1750 – 24 February 1777 Her Royal Highness The Princess of Brazil, Duchess of Braganza * 24 February 1777 – 16 December 1815 Her Most Faithful Majesty The Queen of Portugal and the Algarves * 16 December 1815 – 20 March 1816 Her Most Faithful Majesty The Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves == Notes == == References == Category:1734 births Category:1816 deaths Category:People from Lisbon Category:House of Braganza Category:Kings and Queens of Portugal Category:Heirs and heiresses presumptive",
