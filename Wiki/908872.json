 "text": "Lean, also known as purple drank, purp, or oil is a drug drink, made by mixing cough or cold syrup containing codeine and promethazine with a drink, like Sprite. Sometimes, Jolly Rancher candy is added. The drink originated in Houston, Texas, and is popular in hip hop culture or those who live in the southern United States. Jokes have been made about this drug, most commonly \"I LOVE LEAN\". Lean has killed a lot of people, most often rappers, and it often leads to addiction. The addition is partly to the codeine and is difficult to quit. It was used before rappers (like those on SoundCloud and the so-called mumble rappers) by country/blues singers, in Texas. It is dangerous. == References == Category:Opioids",
