 "text": "Prignitz () is a Kreis (district) in the northwestern part of Brandenburg, Germany. The present district was formed in 1993 by joining the old districts of Pritzwalk and Perleberg and some municipalities from the district of Kyritz. The westernmost part of the district was a part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and changed to be part of Brandenburg on August 1, 1992. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms shows a goose, the symbol of the Gans zu Putlitz family (Gans is German for goose), one of the families who brought Christianity and German culture to Prignitz. The pearls around the goose symbolize Perleberg (which means the Mountain of Pearl). The wolf in bottom stands for the former capital city Pritzwalk, as walk is from the slavonic wolk meaning wolf. The wavy line is the river Elbe. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Ämter #Perleberg #Pritzwalk #Wittenberge Amt-free municipalities #Groß Pankow #Gumtow #Karstädt #Plattenburg 1\\.
