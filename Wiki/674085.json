 "text": "John McCririck (17 April 1940 - 5 July 2019) was an English television horse racing pundit, journalist and presenter. He began his career in journalism at The Sporting Life, where he twice won at the British Press Awards. He joined the Daily Star, but was later fired by the newspaper. During 1984 and 1985, horse racing moved from ITV to Channel 4 as Channel 4 Racing. In early 2018, McCririck suffered from pneumonia, which caused a dramatic weight loss. He died on 5 July 2019 at a hospital in London at the age of 79. The cause of death was lung cancer. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Interview inThe Guardian, 4 July 2001 * Channel 4 Horse Racing * John McCririck profile at Biogs.com Category:1940 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Cancer deaths in London Category:English journalists Category:English television presenters Category:English sports commentators Category:Writers from Surrey",
