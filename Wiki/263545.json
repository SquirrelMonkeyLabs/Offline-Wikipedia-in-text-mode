 "text": "Manganese(IV) fluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is MnF4. It contains manganese and fluoride ions. The manganese ions are in the +4 oxidation state. It is a light blue-green solid. It is very reactive. It can form very reactive fluorine gas easily. It can be made by reacting fluorine or strong oxidizing agents containing fluorine with several manganese compounds. It was used to make fluorine without using electrolysis. It is much more reactive than manganese(IV) oxide. ==Related pages== *Manganese(III) oxide *Manganese(III) fluoride *Manganese(VII) oxide Category:Manganese compounds Category:Fluorine compounds",
