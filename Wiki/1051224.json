 "text": "Frankenberg's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus frankenbergi) is a frog. It lives in the hills in the middle of Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it between 1850 and 2135 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 26.7 â€“ 29.3 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color with red-bown spots. There is some webbed skin on its feet and spikes on the skin of its back. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks are yellow in color. There are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans cut down trees to get wood to build things with and to make places to grow food and places for animals to eat grass. Scientists named this frog after Regina Bauer Frankenberg. She sent money and made a charitable foundation to help scientists study frogs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
