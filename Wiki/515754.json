 "text": "Maqbool Fida Husain (17 September 1915 â€“ 9 June 2011; ) commonly known as MF Husain, was a modern Indian painter. He was a founding member of The Progressive Artists Group of Bombay (PAG). He is thought to be one of the greatest painters of India. M. F. Husain died, aged 95, on 9 June 2011, following a heart attack. He had been unwell for several months. He died at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery on 10 June 2011. Despite his acclaim, Husain faced significant controversy, especially later in his life, due to his unorthodox depictions of Hindu deities, which some found offensive. This led to legal challenges and threats in India, and Husain lived in self-imposed exile for the latter part of his life, spending time in countries like Qatar and the United Kingdom. Some of his works: \"The Volodarsky Husain\" (1954); The painting was sold (by a European country) in 2025; The price at auction was [$11 million or] $11.6 million.https://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/i/Avg1ox/ullevaal-sykehus-fikk- bilde-i-gave-i-1964-solgt-for-over-120-millioner-kroner.
