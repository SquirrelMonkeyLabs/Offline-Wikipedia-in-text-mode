 "text": "Budō is a Japanese term describing modern Japanese martial arts. Budō, which means \"the martial ways\", has its origins in bushidō, \"the way of the warrior\". The budō arts include aikido, judo, jūkendō, Kendo, Kyūdō, naginata, shorinji kempo and sumo. In battle, budō teaches defense with the ideas of nonviolence and spiritual enlightenment. Originally designed for warfare, budō became a way of self-defense. From his book Meditations on Violence, Rory Miller wrote: \"It is better to avoid than to run; better to run than to de- escalate; better to de-escalate than to fight; better to fight than to die. Budō is based on the principles of Zen. The term budō is often used in another sense to refer to specific martial arts such as Akai Budo, Judo and Kendo.Hosokawa Dogen, Omori Sogen; The Art of a Zen Master (London; New York, Routledge, 2011), p. 103 == References == Category:Japanese martial arts Category:Spirituality",
