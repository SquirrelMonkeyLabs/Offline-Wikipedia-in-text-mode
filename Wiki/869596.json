At that time, it consisted of mostly portable buildings. The first permanent building, Aspen Hall, which currently houses the admission office and student services center, opened in 2001. Folsom Lake College was established on January 9, 2004. In 2005, the college expanded with the addition of the school library in Aspen Hall and the addition of Buckeye Hall and Cypress Hall. Cypress Hall houses science labs and the reading and writing center. The school cafeteria, Falcons Roost, opened in 2006 and currently includes the bookstore and career center. Both Dogwood and Lilac Halls, the former which houses a music lab and practice rooms and an early childhood education lab, opened in 2007. In 2009, the physical education building, located near the Falcon's Roost, opened. In 2011, the Visual Performing Arts building, then known as Three Stages, opened. It includes an 850-seat main theater, a 200-seat city stage, and a 100-seat recital hall. A year later, the center was renamed the Harris Center in honor of Brice Harris, former chancellor of the Los Rios Community College District. Meanwhile, the recital hall was named after Thelma Scott-Skillman, founding president of Folsom Lake College. In 2013, the athletic complex expanded to include a soccer field, baseball and softball stadiums, tennis courts, a track and field complex, and a cross country course. The portable buildings on the main Folsom campus were demolished and replaced with a gymnasium, which opened in 2015. In October 2015, the Rancho Cordova Center opened. In 2016, the DSPS center relocated to a space in Aspen Hall just across from the library. It was originally located next to the admission office. In 2018, the innovation center opened in Aspen Hall.
