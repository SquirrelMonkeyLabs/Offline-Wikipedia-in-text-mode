 "text": "Lester B. Pearson International Airport , called the Toronto Pearson International Airport (or simply Pearson Airport or Toronto Pearson) is an international airport in the Greater Toronto Area. The airport is northwest of downtown Toronto, in Mississauga. The airport is named after Lester B. Pearson, Nobel Peace Prize winner and 14th Prime Minister of Canada. The airport's IATA code, YYZ, may seem unusual at first. However, the code gets its last two letters, YZ, from the old railway station code for Malton, west of the airport. Most Canadian airports start with Y, which gives the code YYZ. YYZ is also the name of a song by the Canadian rock band named Rush. ==Accidents== Accident in 2025: A passenger airplane crashed (February 17) and stopped in upside-down position; There were no deaths;https://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/melding-om-flyulykke-i-toronto- passasjerer-og-mannskap-er-gjort-rede-for/s/5-95-2292461.
