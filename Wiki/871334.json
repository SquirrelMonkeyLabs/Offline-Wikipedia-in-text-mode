The feathers on the front and underside of its body are light gray. Its bill and legs are yellow-green. Its eyes are red. ==Habitat and food== Baillon's crakes live in wetlands, for example swamps. They sometimes run across the top of the water on floating plants. Baillon's crakes eat animals without bones, for example insects, crustaceans, and snails. They catch them in the mud at the edges of wetlands and from floating plants. ==Breeding== Baillon's crake makes a simple nest out of dry plants. It hides the nest in little raised bits of ground near the edge of the swamp. Both the male and female crake sit on the eggs and watch the chicks. ==References== Category:Rallidae",
