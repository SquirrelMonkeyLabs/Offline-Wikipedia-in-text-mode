 "text": "Mount Ararat (Turkish: Ağrı Dağı; Armenian: Արարատ; Kurdish: Grîdax or Çiyayê Agirî) is the tallest peak in the Armenian Highlands and modern-day Turkey. The mountain is always capped with snow, and it is a dormant volcano. It is in Iğdır Province, near the northeast corner of Turkey, 16 km west of Iran and 32 km south of the Armenian border. == History == The people and area who lived in this area was the Armenian kingdom of Ararat (in Assyrian: Urartu). Armenians lived here for nearly 3000 years. In the 16th century the mountain became part of the border between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid dynasty of Persia. Later it was the border of Russia. In 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne put Ararat in the administration of Turkey. It is a national symbol of Armenia and an object of irredentism. == Gallery == Image:Arar sil.jpg|Ararat, Climbing route at 4,700m Image:Arar vrh1.jpg|Ararat, View on snow covered top from 4,900m Image:Arar_dalj5.jpg|Ararat, from 2,700m Image:Ararat dalj1.jpg|Ararat, from a village Image:Arar_dalj2.jpg|Ararat, View with truck driving mountiners Image:Mount Ararat 2, Ararat Plain, Armenia.jpg|Ararat from Ararat plain Image:Ararat.JPG|Ararat, from a Western Armenia perspective Image:Armenia Khorvirap.jpg|Khor Virap monastery in front of Mount Ararat Image:Yerewan with Ararat.jpg|Yerevan, Armenia with Mount Ararat Image:Yerevan Mount Ararat.jpg|Yerevan, Armenia with Mount Ararat in the background Image:Ararat at sunset.jpg|Ararat at sunset == References == Category:Volcanoes of Turkey Category:Mountains of Turkey",
