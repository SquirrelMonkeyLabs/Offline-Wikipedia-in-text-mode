 "text": "The Meitei people (), also called Manipuri people (), is one of the minority ethnic groups in Meghalaya. == History == In 1829, Meitei King Gambhir Singh () of Manipur kingdom, had victory over the Khasi people, which became one of the three largest communities in the contemporary Meghalaya state. Among the Meitei people, the Khasi people, or the Khasiyas, were called \"Khahi\" (). To celebrate the victory of the Meiteis over the Khasis, a historical account titled \"Khahi Ngamba\" () was composed in Meitei language by Chingakham Chaobaton (), a scholar of the Meitei royal court. When the Britishers constructed roadways from Sylhet to Guwahati passing through Shillong (Khasi predominant area), the Khasi people stopped the Britishers and even killed two Britishers and numerous coolies. Afterwards, David Scott, the then British officer, requested Gambhir Singh, the then Meitei king of Manipur kingdom through special letter, for help. Gambhir Singh marched with his armies from Manipur. He was received by the Britishers at Sylhet. He warned the Khasi ruler not to stop the Britishers. The Khasi ruler didn't step back. Afterwards, there was a battle between the Khasi and the Meitei armies. The Khasis were defeated. The Khasi ruler and his men were captured and handed over to the Britishers. The Khasi capital city was controlled. Both the Khasi and Jaintia Hills were under the control of the Meiteis. == Geographical distribution == In the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, there are six Meitei populated settlements, namely Ichamati, Koilaghat, Bairong/Mawbang, Kurikhal, Nayabasti and Bholaganj. These are located 100km from Meghalaya's capital Shillong, near the international border line of Bangladesh. == Language and literature == Only few Meitei people especially of Bholaganj village of Meghalaya can speak Meitei language (alias Manipuri language) properly. There is a fear among the Meitei people that their mother language might be replaced by other languages. The Manipuri Sahitya Parishad (), which is a group working for the development of Meitei language and literature, has its branch office in Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya. It functions as one of the leading associations and organizations to promote the literary culture of the Meitei people. It annually organises literary events, including award ceremonies, etc. Books are also published in Meitei language in Meghalaya. == Culture == === Architecture === Unlike others, the houses of the Meitei people of Bholaganj village usually do not follow the traditional Meitei architecture rules and regulations (known as \"Yumsarol\" in Meitei language). === Cinema === In 2023, in the first Meghalaya International Film Festival in Shillong, a Meitei language movie named \"Eikhoigee Yum\" (, ), directed by Romi Meitei, was shown. === Clothing === Meitei men wear Khudei (, traditional loincloth) and women wear phanek (, traditional sarong) in Meghalaya. === Family names === People with Meitei family names (surnames) including Naorem, Yensenbam, Moirangthem, Soraisam, Khongbantabam, Lukram, Nongmaithem, Ngangbam, Meisnam, Khuirem, Leimapokpam, Thokchom and Laishram among many, are found in Meghalaya. === Festivals === The holy and sacred Meitei festival of Umang Lai Haraoba () is celebrated in Meghalaya. It is specifically celebrated in Koilaghat region. === Religion === In Meghalaya, Meitei people worship Lainingthou Sanamahi () and Leimarel Sidabi () like other Meiteis. == Education == === Students in election === General Assembly of Shillong Manipuri students is annually organised by the Shillong Manipuri Students' Union (SMSU) for the selection of its key official members for the administration of the group. == Discrimination == Certain Meitei settlements in Meghalaya, especially those living in the Bholaganj village along the Indo- Bangladesh, are facing discrimination of not being recognised by the government of Meghalaya. Thus, the residents couldn't access to any benefits of government schemes. == Support to Manipur == Meitei civil society organizations (CSOs) based in Meghalaya grouped together and organised protests against the government of India, urging the then prime minister Narendra Modi, in Shillong, to bring back peace and stability in the state of Manipur, which was then suffering from violence. The Manipuri Elders Consortium Shillong (MECS) is one of leading associations and organizations among them. == Associations and organizations == * Manipuri Elders Consortium Shillong (MECS) == Related pages == * Meitei people in Assam * Meitei people in Bangladesh * Meitei people in Myanmar * Meitei people in Tripura == References == == Other websites == Category:Meitei people Category:Meghalaya",
