The device let deaf people communicate by telephone. Although Robert Weitbrecht did much of the actual design work, Marsters promoted the device's use. Marsters was born in Norwich, New York. Marsters died in Pasadena, California from heart disease and West Nile virus, aged 85. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Deaths from heart disease Category:Deaths from West Nile virus Category:American inventors Category:Scientists from New York (state)",
