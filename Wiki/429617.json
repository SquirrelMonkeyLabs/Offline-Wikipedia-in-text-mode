Advocates receive training on the laws of child abuse and neglect.George F Cole; Christopher E Smith; Christina DeJong, The American System of Criminal Justice, 13th Edition (Mason,OH: Cengage Learning, 2013), p. 369 They learn how to interview children and how to work with children with special needs. All advocates are trained to evaluate a family's situation. The typical training is about 30 hours spent in workshops and 10 hours spent in observing court cases and procedures. They also receive 12 hours of in-service training each year. Each CASA location has a volunteer coordinator. Together with a location's overseer (manager) they give help and advice to the advocates. == Notes == == References == Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States Category:Child abuse Category:1977 establishments in the United States",
