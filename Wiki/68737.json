 "text": "Lolo Ferrari (9 February 1963 – 5 March 2000) was the stage name of a French dancer and actress billed as \"the woman with the largest breasts in the world\", though their size was artificially achieved. She was born Eve Valois in Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dome. She started as a model and a prostitute. Encouraged by her husband, Ferrari underwent numerous plastic surgery operations to create a silicone-enhanced bust (22 enlargements, a Guinness world record). She became a regular guest on the television series Eurotrash on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Ferrari committed suicide by drug overdose in Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes. == References == Category:1963 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Drug-related suicides Category:French movie actors Category:French models Category:French television personalities Category:Actors from Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Category:People from Clermont- Ferrand Category:Pornographic actors Category:Prostitutes Category:Suicides in France Category:World record holders",
