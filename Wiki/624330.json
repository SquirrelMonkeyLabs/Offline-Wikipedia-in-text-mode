 "text": "Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop FAA is a physicist and academic at the University of Queensland. She has led pioneering work in atom optics, laser micromanipulation, laser physics, linear and nonlinear high resolution spectroscopy, and nano-optics. Halina Rubinsztein (later Rubinsztein-Dunlop) was born in Poland. She emigrated to Sweden and took her B.Sc. and PhD degree from the University of Gothenburg. == Career == Rubinsztein-Dunlop moved to Australia in 1989, after her marriage to engineer Gordon Dunlop. She joined the staff of the Department of Physics at the University of Queensland. Rubinsztein-Dunlop established a research team that conducted research in laser physics. In 1995, she and a colleague established a Science in Action program, that was used to outreach educational programs for schools relating to the physical sciences. Rubinsztein-Dunlop was appointed Professor of physics in 2000. She became Head of the University of Queensland Department of Physics, and later School of Mathematics and Physics from 2006-2013. She is Director of Quantum Science Laboratory and Manager of one of the scientific programs of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems. She initiated experimental programs in laser micromanipulation and atom optics at the University of Queensland. Her team was successful in demonstrating dynamical tunnelling in the Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) Laboratory in a modulated standing wave. Rubinzstein-Dunlop's team has observed dynamical tunnelling in quantum chaotic systems. Rubinsztein-Dunlop was made a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2016. Rubinsztein-Dunlop was awarded with an Order of Australia (AO) in the 2018 Queenâ€™s Birthday Honours List for \"distinguished service to laser physics and nano-optics as a researcher, mentor and academic, to the promotion of educational programs, and to women in science\". == Published works == Rubinsztein-Dunlop has published over 200 works in journals and books. She has also featured on radio and television. == Awards == * 2003 AIP Women in Physics lecturer * Fellow of SPIE * Fellow of OSA * 2016 Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science * 2018 Order of Australia == Memberships == * Rubinsztein-Dunlop is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of NTT Basic Research Laboratories, Japan. * She is a member of the Editorial Boards of IOP Journal of Optics and Journal of Biophotonics. * She is a member of the Advisory Board of Laser Beckmann Institute. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2018 Category:Living people Category:Polish scientists Category:Physicists Category:Australian academics Category:1950 births Category:Officers of the Order of Australia",
