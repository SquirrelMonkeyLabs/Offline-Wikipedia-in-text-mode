The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University is named after Walter Cronkite. == Career == Cronkite was born on November 4, 1916 in St. Joseph, Missouri. He studied at the University of Texas at Austin. In 1935 he left school to work for the Houston Post. He later worked for several midwestern radio stations.

He was the only non-NASA recipient of a Moon-rock award. Cronkite was well known for his departing catchphrase \"And that's the way it is,\" followed by the date on which the appearance aired. Cronkite made history when he became the first television reporter to announce the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In the newsroom at CBS, the cameras were not ready when the news came in over the wire service. Cronkite's voice was broadcast over a blank CBS placard on the screen: \"Bulletin . . . In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade. The first reports say the President was seriously wounded, that he slumped over in Mrs. Kennedy's lap, she cried out, 'Oh, no!' and the motorcade went on . . . The wounds perhaps could be fatal . . .\"'America's Long Vigil', TV Guide, Issue 565, Vol. 12, No. 4 (January 25, 1964), p. 79 For three and a half days there was no entertainment, no commercials, just the news. Cronkite's reporting of Vietnam was controversial. He reported the events on the evening news. But at the Tet Offensive he traveled there to see the results. What he saw upset him. On February 27, 1968, Cronkite reported the war in Vietnam could not be won. This was a major change from his usual objective reporting. He was voicing his own opinion on national television. It was the view of David Halberstam and others that Cronkite's broadcast turned many Americans against the war. Also that it played a part in Lyndon B. Johnson's decision not to run for another term as President. The other viewpoint is that Americans had already turned against the war before Cronkite's broadcast. After watching Cronkite's broadcast, Lyndon Johnson said to his press secretary, George Christian, \"If I have lost Walter Cronkite, Iâ€™ve lost Middle America.\" Whatever effect Cronkite's broadcast had, by 1967 Johnson's approval rating on the war was down to 32%. == Personal life == Cronkite was married to Mary Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Maxwell from 1940 until her death in 2005. They had three children. Cronkite died on the morning of July 17, 2009 in New York City, New York from cerebrovascular disease, aged 92. == References == == Other websites == * Walter Cronkite Honored by NASA with a Moon Rock as an Ambassador of Exploration * Walter Cronkite Narration for Chatham Radio WCC documentary by Mooncusser Films * Walter Cronkite: A Living Legend Still Loving Animals * Biography on InterfaithAlliance * Spacefacts biography of Walter Cronkite * Amateur Radio Today (video) * Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University * University of Texas TV ads * Cronkite's personal blog * Cronkite's filmography on IMDB * Web ZIne from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University * Signature of Walter Cronkite * YouTube clip of Cronkite's famous Tet Offensive commentary on February 27, 1968 edition of CBS Evening News Category:1916 births Category:2009 deaths Category:American television news anchors Category:American war correspondents Category:Deaths from cerebrovascular disease Category:American Emmy Award winners Category:Peabody Award winners Category:Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients Category:Writers from Missouri",
