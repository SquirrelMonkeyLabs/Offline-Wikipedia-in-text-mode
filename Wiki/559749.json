 "text": "The 2013–14 NHL season was the 97th season of operation (96th season of play) of the National Hockey League (NHL). This season had a realignment. The league's 30 teams changed from six divisions to four divisions. The regular season began October 1 and ended April 13. The 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs began April 16. For the first time since 1973, only one Canadian team made the playoffs: the Montreal Canadiens. There was no all-star game this season, due to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Prior to the season, the NHL, International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and Olympic officials reached an agreement to send NHL players to the Olympics game. The league took a break on February 9 and resumed play on February 25. The new divisions are: Western Conference Pacific Division Central Division Anaheim Ducks Chicago Blackhawks Calgary Flames Colorado Avalanche Edmonton Oilers Dallas Stars Los Angeles Kings Minnesota Wild Phoenix Coyotes Nashville Predators San Jose Sharks St. Louis Blues Vancouver Canucks Winnipeg Jets Eastern Conference Atlantic Division Metropolitan Division Boston Bruins Carolina Hurricanes Buffalo Sabres Columbus Blue Jackets Detroit Red Wings New Jersey Devils Florida Panthers New York Islanders Montreal Canadiens New York Rangers Ottawa Senators Philadelphia Flyers Tampa Bay Lightning Pittsburgh Penguins Toronto Maple Leafs Washington Capitals ==References== ==Other websites== *NHL.com Category:2013 in ice hockey Category:2014 in ice hockey Category:National Hockey League seasons Category:2014 in North America",
