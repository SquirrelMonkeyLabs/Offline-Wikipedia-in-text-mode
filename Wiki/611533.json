The total land area of the eight states is 855,767 square miles (2,216,426 square kilometers). The words \"Mountain States\" generally refer to the U.S. states that cover the Rocky Mountains, which are oriented north-south through parts of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico. Arizona and Nevada, as well as other parts of Utah and New Mexico, have other smaller mountain ranges and scattered mountains located in them as well. Sometimes, the Trans-Pecos area of the far west of Texas is considered part of the region. Category:Regions of the United States",
