 "text": "Le nozze di Figaro, ossia la folle giornata (The Marriage of Figaro, or The Day of Madness) is an opera buffa with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Lorenzo Da Ponte wrote the Italian libretto (the text of the opera). The opera premiered at the Burgtheater, Vienna on 1 May, 1786. It was well received and nearly every scene received an encore, which made the performance really long. The Emperor did not like how long the perfomance was and wanted it to stop. The opera is based on the 1784 French play, La folle journ√©e, ou le Mariage de Figaro by Pierre Beaumarchais. The play was very controversial in its day (and even banned briefly in France). But, Da Ponte removed the play's questionable material and the Viennese censors approved the opera. ==Cast== * Count Almaviva * Countess Almaviva (soprano), the Count's wife * Figaro, Count Almaviva's servant and Susanna's betrothed * Susanna (soprano), the Countess' maid and Figaro's betrothed * Cherubino, a page boy ==Story== The opera is set in the palace and gardens of Count Almaviva in Seville, Spain.
