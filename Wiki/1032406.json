 "text": "Santali cinema, also known as Sollywood Production, has its presence in the Indian states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, and parts of Nepal (especially Jhapa District and Morang District), where Santals live. Santali films are made in the Santali language. ==History== Although some initiatives have been taken to support Santali cinema, allowing it to prosper, only three films managed to make it to the big screen : Chando Likhon, which was released in 2001, was the first film to be made on 35 mm movie film; second in this series was Sagun Ena Sohag Dular (2003), which was loosely based on the 1982 Bollywood film Nadiya Ke Paar; Jewee Jurie (Life Partner) (2009) was produced by Santali Speed Production and released widely in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, and others. Bonodal (The Change) (2016), Nepal's first historic Santali feature film, was produced and directed by Kiran Khatiwada. ==Overview== Santali cinema has not been able to create an identity as a film industry like most other cinemas in India. Every year about 8 to 10 films are made and released directly, on CDs only. None of them are released in cinema halls, due to low budget and little support by the state government in development of the cinema. Music albums are preferred over video films, as the budget is very low and production cost is easily recovered. The number of these ranges from 10 to 20. Santali cinema has a good scope in the states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam and Odisha. Most of its viewers reside in these regions. ==Present status== As there is no film development corporation in Jharkhand, the Santali film industry is in a difficult position. Films and music albums are made less in number and distributed inefficiently. In Jharkhand, Dhanbad, Jamshedpur and their surroundings, don't have proper cinema halls and ticket prices are very low compared to multiplexes all over India. So releasing a film in cinema halls is not very profitable. ==Santali films== * Sondhayni (2019) directed by Seral Murmu * Raawah (2017) directed by Seral Murmu * Chando Likhon (The Script Of God) (2001) first film to be made on 35 mm film * Hai Re Aree Chali (Alas!
