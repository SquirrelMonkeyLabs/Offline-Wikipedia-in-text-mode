 "text": "Morning glory is a family of common flowering plants known as Convolvulaceae which includes bindweed. == Behaviour == Most morning glory flowers curl up and close during the warm parts of the day, and are wide open in the morning, like their name. On a cloudy day, the flower may last until night. The flowers usually start to fade a few hours before the petals start curling. They prefer full sun throughout the day. Some morning glories - such as Ipomoea muricata - are night-blooming flowers. == Cooking uses == Ipomoea aquatica (known as \"water spinach\", \"water morning-glory\", \"water convolvulus\", \"Ong-Choy\", \"Kang-kung\", or \"swamp cabbage\") is used as a green vegetable. == References == Category:Convolvulaceae Category:Epiphytes Category:Flowers",
