 "text": "In economics, the consumption function shows a relationship between consumption and disposable income.Algebraically, this means C = f(Y_{d}) where f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{+} is a function that maps levels of disposable income Y_{d}—income after government intervention, such as taxes or transfer payments—into levels of consumption C. It is believed that John Maynard Keynes introduced the idea in macroeconomics in 1936. He used it to develop the idea of a government spending multiplier. ==Details== Its simplest form is the linear consumption function. It is used often in simple Keynesian models: :C = a + b \\times Y_{d} where a is the autonomous consumption that is independent of disposable income; in other words, consumption when there is no income. The term b \\times Y_{d} is the induced consumption that is influenced by the economy's income level. It is generally assumed that there is no correlation or dependence between Y_{d} and C. ==References== ==More reading== * (Undergraduate level discussion of the subject.) * (Graduate level discussion of the subject.) ==Other websites== * An essay examining the strengths and weaknesses of Keynes's theory of consumption Category:Macroeconomics",
