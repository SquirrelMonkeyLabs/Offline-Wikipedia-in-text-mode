 "text": "The belly-spooted frog or belly spotted frilled tree frog (Kurixalus baliogaster) is a frog. It lives in Laos and Vietnam. Scientists think it could also live in Cambodia. People have seen it between 600 and 1780 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests with evergreen trees, near streams. This frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings change the places where the frog lives to build farms for rubber, coffee, and tea. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
