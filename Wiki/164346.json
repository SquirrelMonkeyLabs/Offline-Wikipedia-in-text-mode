Probably also implementations of RFC 2810, RFC 2811, RFC 2812, RFC 2813, and possibly IRCX. * +channels (In early IRCds, these were simply named channels. At least one modern IRCd (IRCD) uses the + prefix for modeless channels, i.e. no chanops and channel mode forced to +nt. This is described in RFC 2811.) * #channels (\"+channels\" were later replaced with \"#channels\" in version 2.7, numeric channels were removed entirely and channel bans (mode +b) were implemented.) * &channels; (irc2.8, those that exist only on the current server, rather than the entire network) * !channels (irc2.10, those that are theoretically safe from suffering from the many ways that a user could exploit a channel by \"riding a netsplit\"; IRCds using timestamping provide (most of) this functionality on #channels) * %#channels (#channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX) * %&channels; (&channels; whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX) * %!channels (!channels whose name are in UTF-8 for IRCX) IRC daemon Channel Types Halfop Support (+h %) Admin/Protect Support (+a/+u &/!/*) Founder/Owner Support (+q ~/.)
