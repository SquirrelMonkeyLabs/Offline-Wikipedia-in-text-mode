 "text": "In Aeronautics, the angle of attack is the angle between an airfoil and the direction the air is flowing in relative to the wing. For small angles of attack, a higher angle creates more lift. The angle where the wing makes the most lift is called the critical angle of attack. If the angle goes above this point, the wing will stall. Angle of attack is the tilt of an object, like a wing, against the wind it is moving through. == References == Category:Technology Category:Aircraft",
