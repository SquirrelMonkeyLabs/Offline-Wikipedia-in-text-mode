 "text": "In 2020, Freedom House ranked Egypt as \"Not Free\" in its annual Freedom in the World report. It gave Egypt a \"Political Rights\" score of 7/40 and a \"Civil Liberties\" score of 14/60, with a total score of 21/100. The same year, Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt at 166th place in its annual Press Freedom Index. ==LGBT rights== Homosexuality is considered taboo. Until recently, the government denied that homosexuality existed in Egypt, but recently official crackdowns have occurred for reasons felt to include the desire to appease Islamic clerics, to distract from economic issues, or as a cover-up for closet homosexuals in high places. In 2002, 52 men were rounded up on the Queen Boat, a floating nightclub, by police, where they were beaten and tortured. Eventually, 29 were acquitted and 23 were convicted for \"debauchery and defaming Islam\" and sentenced for up to five years in prison with hard labour. Since the trial was held in a state security court, no appeal was allowed. ==References== Egypt Category:Egypt",
