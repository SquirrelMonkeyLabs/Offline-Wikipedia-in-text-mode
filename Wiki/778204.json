 "text": "Male privilege is the system of advantages or rights that men have because of their sex. Special privileges and status are granted to males in patriarchal societies. Many men have responded to this by saying that they do not feel that they have been given any unearned advantages, such as in their struggles to find success in employment, education, or relationships. Supporters for men's rights and father's rights as well as anti-feminist men often accept that men's traditional roles are damaging to men. ==References== Category:Feminism",
