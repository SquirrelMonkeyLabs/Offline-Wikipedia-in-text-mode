 "text": "The Lorentz transformations is a set of equations that describe a linear transformation between a stationary reference frame and a reference frame in constant velocity. The equations are given by: x'=\\frac{x-vt}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} , y'=y , z'=z , t'=\\frac{t-\\frac{vx}{c^2}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} where x'represents the new x co-ordinate, v represents the velocity of the other reference frame, t representing time, and c the speed of light. On a Cartesian coordinate system, with the vertical axis being time (t), the horizontal axis being position in space along one axis (x), the gradients represent velocity (shallower gradient resulting in a greater velocity). If the speed of light is set as a 45Â° or 1:1 gradient, Lorentz transformations can rotate and squeeze other gradients while keeping certain gradients, like a 1:1 gradient constant. Points undergoing a Lorentz transformations on such a plane will be transformed along lines corresponding to t^2-x^2=n^2 where n is some number Category:Equations of physics Category:Relativity Category:Functions and mappings Category:Time",
