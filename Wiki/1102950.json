People say that this temple is named after Kullu Wali Mata. It is named after the city of Himachal Pradesh, Kullu. This city is hundreds of kilometers away from Rajasthan. This local goddess of Himachal, Bhuvaneshwari Mata, changed her place and became famous as Shri Kullu Wali Mata in Kishangarh Renwal. Nathuram, a resident of Renwal, decorated the idol of Mata from Bhuvaneshwari Dham and seated it in a chariot and brought it to Rajasthan in 2006. Goddess Bhuvaneshwari Mata of Himachal was first brought to the famous Shaktipeeth Jeen Mata temple of Rajasthan. Here, she was anointed with holy water. The priest of Jeen Mata temple worshiped Mata. Here Nathuram performed the night vigil of Mata and then seated the idol of Mata in the chariot and brought it to his home in Renwal. Mata remained seated on the roof of Nathuram's house for years. In the year 2023, the idol of the mother was consecrated under the guidance of Saint Hirapuri Maharaj and Mahant Dr. Jugal Kishore Sharan. After worshiping Mata Bhuvneshwari for three days, the mother appeared in the dream of devotee Nathuram and said that my temple will become famous from Renwal Dham. I will be worshipped as \"Kullu Wali Mataji\". Since then, Kullu Wali Mata is being worshipped as Shakti Swaroop. Every year, on the day of the arrival of the mother in Rajasthan, huge programs are held in the temple premises in which thousands of devotees participate and fulfill their wishes by seeing the mother.
