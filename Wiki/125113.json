The party is now headed by Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Awami League has been in government twice, about eight and a half years, since Bangladesh's independence in 1971. The party was openly involved in terrorist activities and hampering freedom of speech. Head of party Sheikh Hasina has also been widely refered to as an autocrat sometimes a dictator even. Despite once having wide support, the party has lost it due to the immense amount of corruption and other inhumane activities it has been involved in. Category:Political parties in Bangladesh",
