 "text": "Red Square (, ) is the most famous city square in Moscow, Russia. The square separates the Kremlin, the former royal citadel and currently the official residence of the President of Russia, from a historic merchant quarter known as Kitay-gorod (China-Town). As major streets of Moscow radiate from here in all directions, being promoted to major highways outside the city, the Red Square is often considered the central square of Moscow and of all Russia. Red Square and the Kremlin are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Joseph Stalin's body was preserved near Red Square, in Lenin's mausoleum. It was later moved and reburied deep behind the Kremlin Wall without any ceremony. Red Square is a popular tourist attraction in Russia. == Other websites == * Red Square in Moscow, the most important place in the country's largest. - Thewotme Travel Blog * Moscow-Life: A guide to Moscow's Red Square * 3D model of Red Square * Visiting Red Square â€“ Useful information for visitors to Red Square and the Kremlin *Red Square and surrounding area time-lapse video Category:Moscow Category:World Heritage Sites in Russia Category:National squares Category:Town squares in Europe",
