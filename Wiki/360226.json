 "text": "The Life and Loves of a She-Devil is a 1983 novel by British feminist author Fay Weldon. It is about a highly unattractive woman who goes to great lengths to take revenge on her husband and his attractive lover. The book, Weldon says, is about envy, rather than revenge. The novel was made into two movies. In 1986 it was as an award-winning BBC television serial. It starred Patricia Hodge as Mary Fisher, Dennis Waterman as Bobbo and Julie T. Wallace as Ruth. In 1989 it was made as She-Devil. This version starred Roseanne Barr as the \"she-devil\" and Meryl Streep as her adversary, Mary Fisher. ==Other websites== * * * Category:1983 books Category:British television series Category:BAFTA Award winners",
