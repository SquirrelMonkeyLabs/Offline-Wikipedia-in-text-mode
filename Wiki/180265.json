His mother, Patricia (née Laidlaw), died when he was 29 and his father, W.G.R.M. \"Ran\" Laurie, was a doctor and an athlete who won the gold medal in rowing 1948 in London.

He became world-famous as Dr. Gregory House in the long-running television series House. Laurie studied at Eton and then went to Selwyn College, Cambridge: he took a degree in archeology and social anthropology. He was an athlete like his father, but he became an actor after meeting Emma Thompson, who introduced him to his future best friend and co-worker, Stephen Fry.
