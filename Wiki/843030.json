In New Zealand and Australia, it is known as Porterhouse and Sirloin (striploin steak) and can be found in the Handbook of Australian Meat under codes 2140 to 2143. In the UK and Ireland it is called sirloin. In Canada, most meat sellers refer to this cut as a strip loin; in French it is known as contre-filet. Delmonico's Restaurant, an operation opened in New York City in 1827, sold as one of its signature dishes a cut from the short loin called a Delmonico steak. Due to its association with the city, it is often called a New York strip steak. ==Preparation== Like most steaks, the Strip steak can be cooked with different methods. ==References== Category:Cuts of beef",
