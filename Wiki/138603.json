The village is 33 kilometres north of Salzburg, four kilometres east of the German border and can be travelled to in half an hour by car from the town of Petting, in Bavaria. == History and name == Fugging (which was Fucking at the time) has existed since at least 1070 and is named after a man from the 6th century called \"Fuko\". In old Germanic, \"-ing\" is used to describe people as belonging to their leader; so \"Fucking\" means \"(place of) Fuko’s people.\"Brits steal carloads of Fucking Austrian roadsigns Although the village has a population of 104 , it has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its name, which is spelled the same as the continuous form of the profane English-language verb \"fuck\". Fucking's most famous feature is a traffic sign with its name on it, which tourists often photograph. This street sign is often stolen.Urban Legends Reference Pages: Welcome to Austria Significant public funds have been spent on replacing the stolen signs.What’s the F---ing joke? In 2004, because many signs had been stolen, a vote was held to change the village name, but the villagers voted not to change. In August 2005, the road signs were welded to a very strong pole. This made it more difficult to steal them. Fucking changed its name to Fugging, the name change came to affect on 1 January 2021. == References == == Other websites == Category:Settlements in Upper Austria",
