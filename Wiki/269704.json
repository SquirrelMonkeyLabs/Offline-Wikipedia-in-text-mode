 "text": "The Scottish Green Party (also known as the Scottish Greens) is a political party in Scotland that has close relations to the Green Party of England and Wales. The party's policies usually promote green politics, nuclear disarmament, anti-nuclear power, proportional representation, and the creation of an independent Scotland free from the United Kingdom but within the European Union. If Scotland becomes an independent country the party wants the country to be a republic, and no longer be part of the monarchy of the United Kingdom. It also wants an independent Scotland to have its own currency. In the Scottish Parliament the party is an opposition party with 7 out of 129 seats. It does not have any seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The co-leaders of the party are Patrick Harvie (MSP) and Lorna Slater (MSP). ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Political parties in Scotland Category:Green political parties",
