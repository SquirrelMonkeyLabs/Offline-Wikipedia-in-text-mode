 "text": "Women and girls in the United States join gangs for different reasons than males. Female gangs and female gang membership have been documented by historians dating back to the early 20th century. Suburban counties and smaller cities have more female gangs. According to one survey, 2% of all gangs in the United States have only female members. Independently functioning units are all-female gangs. They operate by their own gang colors and name. They do not have oversight from any existing male gangs. ==References== Category:Women Category:Gangs Category:Crime in the United States",
