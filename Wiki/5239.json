 "text": "Grace Patricia Kelly (November 12, 1929 – September 14, 1982) was an American actress and royal. She later married Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and became Her Serene Highness The Princess of Monaco. == Early life == Grace Patricia Kelly was born at Hahnemann University Hospital, Philadelphia on November 12, 1929. Her father was an Irish and her mother was a German. == Acting career == Grace Kelly graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1949. She made her film debut in Fourteen Hours (1951) and gained stardom from her roles in Fred Zinnemann's western film High Noon (1952), and John Ford's adventure- romance Mogambo (1953). Other notable works include Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, and To Catch a Thief. In 1955 she won an Academy Award for The Country Girl. She was the first actress to appear on a postage stamp. She was also mentioned in Billy Joel's song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" and in Mika's song \"Grace Kelly\" (2007). The classic head-cover of a silk scarf crossed under the chin and knotted at the side or nape of the neck is universally known as the \"Grace Kelly\". This chic look is still copied by many female Hollywood stars when they wish to retain a degree of anonymity in the public eye. == Life as a royal == Grace Kelly retired from acting at age 26 to marry Rainier III of Monaco. With Prince Rainier, she had three children: * Princess Caroline of Monaco (born January 23, 1957) * Albert II, Prince of Monaco (born March 14, 1958) * Princess Stéphanie of Monaco (born February 1, 1965) As Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly was known for her charity work. == Death == On September 13, 1982, Kelly suffered a stroke while she was driving her 1972 Rover P6 3500, which caused her to crash the car. She died in hospital the next day. Her 17-year-old daughter, Stéphanie sustained a hairline fracture of a neck vertebra but survived. Her son, Prince Albert, helped establish the Princess Grace Awards in 1984. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:American Academy Award winning actors Category:Actors from Philadelphia Category:American movie actors Category:American stage actors Category:American television actors Category:Golden Globe Award winning actors Category:Road accident deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:1929 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Recipients of the Order pro merito Melitensi Category:Princes and princesses of Monaco",
