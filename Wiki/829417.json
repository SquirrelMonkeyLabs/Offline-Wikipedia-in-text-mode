 "text": "The Heysel Stadium disaster (; ; ; ; ; ; ) was a human stampede that occurred on 25 May 1985, when Juventus fans escaping from a breach by Liverpool fans were pressed against a collapsing wall in the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, Belgium, before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final. 39 people were killed and 600 were injured in the confrontation. The tragedy resulted in all English football clubs being banned indefinitely by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) from all European competitions (lifted in 1990–91), with Liverpool being excluded for an additional three years. The Liverpool ban would later be reduced from 3 years to 1 year. 14 Liverpool fans would be found guilty of manslaughter and each sentenced to three years' imprisonment. The disaster was later described as \"the darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions\".Quote from UEFA Chief Executive Lars- Christer Olsson in 2004, uefa.com == Deaths == Of the 39 people killed, 32 were Italian (including two minors), four Belgian, two French, and one from Northern Ireland.The 39 victims who died at Heysel Stadium -liverpooldailypost.co.uk == References == == Other websites == * Heysel Disaster Original reports from The Times, at Internet Archive * Heysel Tragedy article on LFC Online * BBC Sports columnist Alan Hansen – Reds tie evokes Heysel memories * Football Violence in Europe Paper by the Social Issues Research Centre * Partial article by Paul Tompkins Category:1985 disasters Category:1985 in Europe Category:1980s crimes in Europe Category:1980s disasters in Europe Category:1980s in Belgium Category:Football in Belgium Category:Brussels Category:Juventus F.C.
