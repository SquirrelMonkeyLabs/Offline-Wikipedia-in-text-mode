Scientists think it might also live in French Guiana, Colombia, and Venezuela. The adult male frog is 39-53 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 49-57 mm. The skin on the back is brown with spots. There may be white spots on the back and sides. The belly is light in color. The legs are dark with stripes across. The iris of the eye is gold in color with black marks. These frogs live in trees and move around at night. They live in forests. The males sit on plants or other things .5 to 4 m off the ground when they sing. The female frog lays about 33 eggs at a time. She lays them in small bodies of water. For example, she may lay them in water in the leaves of a palm tree, hole in a tree, or leaves of a small plant that grows on a tree. The adult female frog comes back to the water and lays more eggs. The tadpoles eat the eggs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
