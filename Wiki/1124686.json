 "text": "A rapid antigen test (RAT), or more commonly known as an Antigen Test kit, is a rapid diagnostic test. It can detect and find the presence and absence of antigens. Rapid tests usually give the results in 5 to 30 minutes.https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical- devices/understanding-home-otc-covid-19-antigen-diagnostic-test-results Sometimes these tests give the wrong result (a false positive). For this reason, a test that gives a positive result needs to be confirmed by another test. That test must not be a rapid antigen test. There are the different rapid antigen test kits, that are made to test for: *HIV-1 & HIV-2 * SARS- CoV-2 & COVID-19 Antigen * Flu A&B; * RSV * Rabies Ag * Pregnancy test (PT). ==Antigen test kits== ; COVID-19 Antigen Since the COVID-19 pandemic, The COVID-19 Ag test has been available. When the COVID-19 cases were increasing across the world, the COVID-19 and the SARS-COV2 kits were used to detect the virus. The \"C\" is for (control), the \"T\" is for (test), and no results means it is invalid.https://diagnostics.roche.com/global/en/products/lab/sars- cov-2-and-flua-b-rapid-antigen-test-cps-000862.html ; Flu A&B; The Influenza test kits are used for people who are suspected of contracting the flu virus. A swab is taken for samples, like the COVID preemptive measures. ; HIV-AIDS The HIV/AIDS or HV-2 test is used to detect if a person may be infected with the HIV virus. The blood sample is taken and dropped 3 times into kit. ; Pregnancy test A pregnancy test (PT) is a kit that shows the possibility of pregnancy by taking a sample of urine. However these tests can be inaccurate and show a positive result because of infection (and blood in urine), hormones, or cancer. They might also show up positive for trans (originally male) people. ; Rabies Ag When the Rabies endemic began, the test kits antigen for rabies were also available for patients who were possibly infected with the rabies virus.https://www.woodleyequipment.com/product/792/Anigen-Rapid- Rabies-Ag ==Related pages== * Vaccine * Wilderness, Concerts and festivals ==References== Category:Medical tests Category:Medical equipment Category:Molecular biology Category:Epidemiology Category:Virology Category:COVID-19 pandemic Category:Pregnancy and childbirth",
