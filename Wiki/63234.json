 "text": "Vande Mataram is the national slogan and national marching song of India. It is not to be confused with the national anthem of India. The lyrics were written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, in a mix of Sanskrit and Bengali. The song was written in 1876, but published in 1882. The title means \"Long live the Mother[land]\". The first version of the Flag of India had \"वन्दे मातरम्\" (Vande Mataram) written on it. == Controversy == Jana Gana Mana was chosen over Vande Mataram as the National Anthem of independent India in January 24, 1950, although before this date, Vande Mataram was treated as such. Vande Mataram was rejected because it offended Muslims by calling India \"Mother Durga\" (a Hindu goddess), equating the nation with Hinduism, and by its origin as part of Anandamatha, a book they felt had an anti-Muslim message. == Lyrics == === English === ==== Full version ==== ===== Translation ===== Mother, I salute thee! Rich with thy hurrying streams, bright with orchard gleams, Cool with thy winds of delight, Green fields waving Mother of might, Mother free. Glory of moonlight dreams, Over thy branches and lordly streams, Clad in thy blossoming trees, Mother, giver of ease Laughing low and sweet! Mother I kiss thy feet, Speaker sweet and low! Mother, to thee I bow. Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands When swords flash out in seventy million hands And seventy million voices roar Thy dreadful name from shore to shore? With many strengths who art mighty and stored, To thee I call Mother and Lord! Thou who saves, arise and save! To her I cry who ever her foe drove Back from plain and sea And shook herself free. Thou art wisdom, thou art law, Thou art heart, our soul, our breath Though art love divine, the awe In our hearts that conquers death. Thine the strength that nerves the arm, Thine the beauty, thine the charm. Every image made divine In our temples is but thine. Thou art Durga, Lady and Queen, With her hands that strike and her swords of sheen, Thou art Lakshmi lotus-throned, And the Muse a hundred-tone, Pure and perfect without peer, Mother lend thine ear, Rich with thy hurrying streams, Bright with thy orchard gleems, Dark of hue O candid-fair In thy soul, with jewelled hair And thy glorious smile divine, Loveliest of all earthly lands, Showering wealth from well-stored hands! Mother, mother mine! Mother sweet, I bow to thee, Mother great and free! translated by Sri Aurobindo ==== Official version ==== वन्दे मातरम् सुजलां सुफलां मलयजशीतलाम् सस्य श्यामलां मातरम् | शुभ्र ज्योत्स्ना पुलकित यामिनीम् फुल्ल कुसुमित द्रुमदलशोभिनीम्, सुहासिनीं सुमधुर भाषिणीम् सुखदां वरदां मातरम् || ===== Translation ===== Mother, I salute thee!
