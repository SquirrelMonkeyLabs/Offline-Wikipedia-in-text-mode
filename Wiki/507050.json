Serving 16 years in prison before being released, he has claimed his innocence many times. In 2013 Bjørg Njaa, a daughter of a judge in the 1958 trial said that her father was prejudiced against Torgersen even before being assigned to the trial. In 2014 he was denied access to official recordings of then leader of the Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine, Bjørnar Olaisen, answering to Criminal Cases Review Commission.Fasting får ikke utlevert lydbånd [Fasting will not receive audio tape] ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Norwegian murderers",
