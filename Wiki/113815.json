 "text": "The 1990–91 NHL season was the 74th regular season of the National Hockey League. Twenty-one teams each played 80 games. The Stanley Cup winners were the Pittsburgh Penguins, who won the best of seven series 4–2 against the Minnesota North Stars. The North Stars defeated the Edmonton Oilers to become the first Norris Division team to appear in the Stanley Cup Finals since all the teams were moved around in 1981. The championship was the first in Penguins history. A record high 92 playoff games were held, and for the first time since the 1973 playoffs, no team was beat in four games in a playoff series. This was the last NHL season to end in the month of May. == Regular season == === Final standings === Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF= Goals For, GA = Goals Against, Pts = Points 'Wales Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Team W L T GF GA Pts Boston Bruins 44 24 12 299 264 100 Montreal Canadiens 39 30 11 273 249 89 Buffalo Sabres 31 30 19 292 278 81 Hartford Whalers 31 38 11 238 276 73 Quebec Nordiques 16 50 14 236 354 46 Campbell Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Team W L T GF GA Pts Chicago Blackhawks 49 23 8 284 211 106 St. Louis Blues 47 22 11 310 250 105 Detroit Red Wings 34 38 8 273 298 76 Minnesota North Stars 27 39 14 256 266 68 Toronto Maple Leafs 23 46 11 241 318 57 === Scoring leaders === Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points, PIM = Penalties in minutes Player Team GP G A Pts PIM Wayne Gretzky Los Angeles Kings 78 41 122 163 Brett Hull St. Louis Blues 78 86 45 131 Adam Oates St. Louis Blues 61 25 90 115 Mark Recchi Pittsburgh Penguins 78 40 73 113 John Cullen Pittsburgh Penguins / Hartford Whalers 78 39 71 110 Joe Sakic Quebec Nordiques 80 48 61 109 Steve Yzerman Detroit Red Wings 80 51 57 108 Theoren Fleury Calgary Flames 79 51 53 104 Al MacInnis Calgary Flames 78 28 75 103 Steve Larmer Chicago Blackhawks 80 44 57 101 == Stanley Cup playoffs == Note: All dates in 1991 === Playoff bracket === === Division semi-finals === ==== Wales Conference ==== {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Boston vs. Hartford Date Away Home April 3 Hartford 5 2 Boston April 5 Hartford 3 4 Boston April 7 Boston 6 3 Hartford April 9 Boston 3 4 Hartford April 11 Hartford 1 6 Boston April 13 Boston 3 1 Hartford Boston wins series 4–2 ==== Campbell Conference ==== {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Chicago vs. Minnesota Date Away Home April 4 Minnesota 4 3 Chicago OT April 6 Minnesota 2 5 Chicago April 8 Chicago 6 5 Minnesota April 10 Chicago 1 3 Minnesota April 12 Minnesota 6 0 Chicago April 14 Chicago 1 3 Minnesota Minnesota wins series 4–2 === Division Finals === Wales Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Boston vs. Montreal Date Away Home April 17 Montreal 1 2 Boston April 19 Montreal 4 3 Boston OT April 21 Boston 3 2 Montreal April 23 Boston 2 6 Montreal April 25 Montreal 1 4 Boston April 27 Boston 2 3 Montreal OT April 29 Montreal 1 2 Boston Boston win series 4–3 Campbell Conference {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" St. Louis vs. Minnesota Date Away Home April 18 Minnesota 2 1 St. Louis April 20 Minnesota 2 5 St. Louis April 22 St. Louis 1 5 Minnesota April 24 St. Louis 4 8 Minnesota April 26 Minnesota 2 4 St. Louis April 28 St. Louis 2 3 Minnesota Minnesota wins series 4–2 === Conference Finals === {| cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\" Boston vs. Pittsburgh Date Away Home May 1 Pittsburgh 3 6 Boston May 3 Pittsburgh 4 5 Boston OT May 5 Boston 1 4 Pittsburgh May 7 Boston 1 4 Pittsburgh May 9 Pittsburgh 7 2 Boston May 11 Boston 3 5 Pittsburgh Pittsburgh wins series 4–2 and Prince of Wales Trophy === Finals === Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Minnesota North Stars Date Away Score Home Score Notes May 15 Minnesota 5 Pittsburgh 4 May 17 Minnesota 1 Pittsburgh 4 May 19 Pittsburgh 1 Minnesota 3 May 21 Pittsburgh 5 Minnesota 3 May 23 Minnesota 4 Pittsburgh 6 May 25 Pittsburgh 8 Minnesota 0 Pittsburgh wins series 4–2 and Stanley Cup Mario Lemieux (Pittsburgh) wins Conn Smythe Trophy == NHL Awards == Presidents' Trophy: Chicago Blackhawks Prince of Wales Trophy: Pittsburgh Penguins Clarence S.
