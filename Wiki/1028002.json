She was with her partner, César Sena, who is defendant in the case of her disappearance. Also involved are César's parents, Emerenciano Sena and Marcela Acuña. They are social leaders who have strong political ties to Chaco Province Governor Jorge Capitanich. The prosecutor in charge of the case has said that the act is an alleged homicide. The case has generated attention and outrage at the local and national level. The disappearance report was filed on June 5 by Gloria Romero, Cecilia's mother. According to security cameras, Cecilia was seen entering Sena's house on June 2, but there is no record of his departure. In addition, the videos show Obregón leaving the home with black bags, which are presumed to be the body of the young woman. Later, Emerenciano and Acuña get into the vehicle and leave the house. On June 18, the primary elections of the 2023 Chaco Provincial Elections were held, and the media agreed that the case had an influence on the results, which resulted in a victory for the opposition to the government. ==Background== Cecilia Strzyzowski worked as an administrative employee at the Emerenciano Sena health center and lived with her partner, César Sena, 19, at the house of Cecilia's aunt, Mercedes. According to the testimony of Gloria Romero, Cecilia's mother and complainant in the case of her disappearance, the relationship between Cecilia and César began in December 2021 through Tinder. However, problems arose in the relationship, especially due to the resistance of César's mother towards their union. In addition, possible control by César over Cecilia's movements through WhatsApp and the possession of weapons by César, who claims to be politically persecuted, has been mentioned. On September 16, 2022, Cecilia and César were married, but four days later they began divorce proceedings, allegedly influenced by César's mother who did not support the relationship. The young couple handed out invitation cards for a wedding party to be held on December 23, however the divorce decree came out two days before and the celebration was postponed indefinitely. Cecilia's mother was unaware of this divorce at the time of her disappearance. The affective relationship between Cecilia and César continued and they were seen together regularly. Cecilia's mother stated that for her, César was an excellent partner and expressed surprise at the version of a friend of Cecilia's, who alleged that on May 3, César would have physically assaulted Cecilia. According to this same statement, Sena was medicated, he would have hit his own mother at one point, and he was manipulating Cecilia. ==Disappearance== On June 1, 2023, Cecilia had a video call with her mother Gloria Romero and told her that she would have a trip to Ushuaia with her partner, César Sena; the reason was a job opportunity.
