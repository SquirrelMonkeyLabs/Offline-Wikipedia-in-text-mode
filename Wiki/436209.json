 "text": "WWE Vengeance, known as NXT Vengeance Day since 2021, is a series of professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming shows made by WWE. The first Vengeance event took place in 2001, replacing Armageddon that year because of the possible insensitivity of the latter's name with respect to the September 11 attacks. In 2002, Vengeance took over Fully Loaded's July pay- per-view slot. The 2003 event was exclusive to the SmackDown! brand, while from 2004 to 2006, the events were Raw-exclusive. In 2005, Vengeance was moved again, this time changing positions with The Great American Bash. The 2007 event was named Vengeance: Night of Champions, with the Night of Champions series replacing Vengeance the following year. In October 2011, the Vengeance name returned for one more pay-per-view event. In February 2021, WWE made NXT TakeOver: Vengeance Day for the NXT brand, renaming it NXT Vengeance Day the following year after the NXT TakeOver series ended. == Events == Raw-branded event SmackDown!-branded event NXT-branded event # Event Date City Venue Main Event Ref. 1 Vengeance (2001) December 9, 2001 San Diego, California San Diego Sports Arena Stone Cold Steve Austin (WWF) vs. Chris Jericho (World) in a match to make the WWF Championship and World Championship into one as the Undisputed WWF Championship 2 Vengeance (2002) July 21, 2002 Detroit, Michigan Joe Louis Arena The Undertaker (c) vs. Kurt Angle vs. The Rock in a triple threat match for the WWE Undisputed Championship 3 Vengeance (2003) July 27, 2003 Denver, Colorado Pepsi Center Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle in a triple threat match for the WWE Championship 4 Vengeance (2004) July 11, 2004 Hartford, Connecticut Hartford Civic Center Chris Benoit (c) vs. Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship 5 Vengeance (2005) June 26, 2005 Paradise, Nevada Thomas & Mack Center Batista (c) vs. Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship 6 Vengeance (2006) June 25, 2006 Charlotte, North Carolina Charlotte Bobcats Arena D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) vs. The Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey) in a 2-on-5 Handicap tag team match 7 Vengeance: Night of Champions June 24, 2007 Houston, Texas Toyota Center John Cena (c) vs. Bobby Lashley vs. King Booker vs. Mick Foley vs. Randy Orton in a Five-Pack Challenge for the WWE Championship 8 Vengeance (2011) October 23, 2011 San Antonio, Texas AT&T; Center Alberto Del Rio (c) vs. John Cena in a Last Man Standing match for the WWE Championship 9 TakeOver: Vengeance Day February 14, 2021 Orlando, Florida Capitol Wrestling Center at WWE Performance Center Finn BÃ¡lor (c) vs. Pete Dunne for the NXT Championship 10 Vengeance Day (2022) February 15, 2022 WWE Performance Center Bron Breakker (c) vs. Santos Escobar for the NXT Championship 11 Vengeance Day (2023) February 4, 2023 Charlotte, North Carolina Spectrum Center Bron Breakker (c) vs. Grayson Waller in a Steel Cage match for the NXT Championship 12 Vengeance Day (2024) February 4, 2024 Clarksville, Tennessee F&M; Bank Arena Ilja Dragunov (c) vs. Trick Williams for the NXT Championship == References == == Other websites == * Category:2001 establishments in the United States Category:Professional wrestling Category:WWE Vengeance Category:World Wrestling Entertainment pay- per-view events",
