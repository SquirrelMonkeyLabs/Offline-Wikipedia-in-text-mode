 "text": "Cupid, also called Amor (Latin for love), is the god of sexual desire in Roman mythology. He fired golden arrows at people to make them fall in love, and lead arrows to make people fall out of love. He was mainly drawn as a cherub, but he might have looked like a normal teenager. He had large feathery wings which he used to fly around in the sky and mainly shot people with his love arrows by flying above them. He secretly did this. And many people asked him for help. ==Related pages== *Eros â€“ Greek mythology version of Cupid. Category:Roman gods and goddesses Category:Gods and goddesses of love and lust",
