Knatchbull was the elder sister of Lady Pamela Hicks, and first cousin to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and the last surviving baptismal sponsor to Prince Charles, Prince of Wales. ==Biography== Mountbatten succeeded her father when he was assassinated in 1979, as his peerages had been created by the Crown with special remainder to his daughters and their heirs male. This inheritance accorded her the title of countess and a seat in the House of Lords, where she remained until 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 removed most hereditary peers from the House.
