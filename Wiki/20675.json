In it, a lady who does not like Spam is talking to a waitress in a restaurant when a bunch of Vikings cut their conversation by singing the word \"Spam\" over and over again.

It was first recorded in 1988. == References == ==Other websites== * â€“ United States * Collection of mid-twentieth century advertising featuring Spam from The TJS Labs Gallery of Graphic Design.
