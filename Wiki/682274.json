 "text": "Serotiny is an ecological adaptation of some seed plants. In these plants, seed release occurs in response to an environmental trigger. The most common and best studied trigger is fire. However, the term serotiny may refer more broadly to plants that release their seeds over a long period of time, irrespective of the trigger or whether release is spontaneous. In this sense, the term is synonymous with bradyspory. == References == Category:Plant physiology",
