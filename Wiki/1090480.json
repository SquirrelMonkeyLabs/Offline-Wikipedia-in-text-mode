The vast majority of mainline trains to and from Bucharest start there. ==History== The original North railway station was built between 1868—1872. The foundation stone was placed on 10 September 1868 in the presence of King Carol I of Romania. The building was designed as a U-shaped structure. The first railways between Roman – Galați – Bucharest – Pitești started on 13 September 1872. Between 1895—1896 a new wing of the station was built, which included a \"Royal Hall\", in anticipation of the visit of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. The station and its surroundings were heavily bombed by the Allies in April 1944 during a campaign aimed at Axis supply lines. During the Communist era the station was electrified During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, from 27 February 2022 onwards, the station served as a coordination point for Ukrainian refugees. On the first day, almost 100 Ukrainian refugees arrived on five trains owned by Romanian state operator CFR Călători; the trains came from Iași and Suceava, in northeast Romania. At midnight on 4 March 2022, approximately 1,000 refugees arrived from Iași and were later accommodated at Romexpo. ==Current status== There are 14 tracks and 8 platforms. ==References== Category:Rail transport in Romania Category:Buildings and structures in Bucharest Category:Railway stations in Europe Category:1872 establishments in Europe Category:19th-century establishments in Romania Category:Railway stations opened in 1872",
