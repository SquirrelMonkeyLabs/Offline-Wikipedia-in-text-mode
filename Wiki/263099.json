Lead azide is an explosive. Most other azides just burn rapidly. It is used as a detonator to detonate other explosives. It is made by reacting lead(II) nitrate and sodium azide. It can be destroyed by sodium dichromate. It can react with other metals such as copper to make even more sensitive azide explosives. It does not become less of an explosive when wet. It will explode if it is dropped . ==Related pages== *Lead(II) oxide *Sodium amide Category:Lead compounds Category:Nitrogen compounds Category:Explosives",
