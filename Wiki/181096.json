 "text": "Liz Cohen (born 1973) is a performance artist. Her best known project is called Bodywork. She changed an old East German small car (a Trabant), so that it can transform into a larger American car (a Chevrolet). She hired a personal trainer and dieted so she could appear in a bikini to be the model for the car. She currently teaches at Cranbrook Academy of Art and lives in Detroit, Michigan. ==References== *Creative Capital listing *Wired magazine *Fast Company magazine Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:American artists",
