The Small Business Administration wants \"to maintain and strengthen the nation's economy by enabling the establishment and viability of small businesses and by assisting in the economic recovery of communities after disasters\". The Small Business Administration (SBA) Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) maximum amounts have changed numerous times since the inception of the popular COVID loan program in March 2020. From the original $2 million, it was quickly reduced to $150,000 when millions of business owners were applying in droves. In 2020 it was raised to $500,000 and in September 2021, it was restored back to the original $2 million maximum for those small businesses that qualify for this size EIDL loan. ==References== Category:United States government agencies",
