 "text": "Abudefduf troschelii, the Pacific sergeant major or Panama sergeant major, is a species of damselfish belonging to the family Pomacentridae that can be identified by the highly visable black stripes on the sides of the fish.Wibowo, K., Koeda, K., Muto, N. et al. Ichthyol Res (2018) 65: 471. Its specific name honors the zoologist Franz Hermann Troschel (1810–1882). It is native to the neritic pelagic zone of the shallow water coral reefs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and they are an omnivorous (mesat and vegetable eating) species feeding on plankton and algae attached to their coral habitat. Abudefduf troschelii is a sister-species of A. saxatilis. Males, like in many other marine species, take care of and defend newborn A. troschelii after they have been hatched by eggs from the female. There are currently no major threats to the species and there is no indication of a current decline in its population size. The IUCN Red List lists this damselfish as being of “least concern”. ==References== Category:Abudefduf",
