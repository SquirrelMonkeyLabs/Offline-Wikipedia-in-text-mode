 "text": "Dryophytes is a genus of tree frogs in the family Hylidae. Most of the frogs live in North America, but some live in eastern Asia. == Description == All frogs in Dryophytes are small and can climb trees. Most of them are green or gray in color. They have disks on the ends of their toes for climbing. The disks help them stick to the trees as they climb. == Habitat == These tree frogs live in wetlands and in forests where the seasons change. They live on the ground and in trees. == Taxonomy == Scientists have changed their minds about whether this is its own genus and how these frogs are related to other frogs: Fitzinger first described (formally wrote about) this genus in 1843. In 1882 scientist George Albert Boulenger, moved it to the genus Hyla, the true tree frogs. In 2014 Fouquette and Dubois wrote that Dryophytes was a subgenus inside Hyla. In 2016, William E. Duellman and his team wrote that scientists should start using Dryophytes as its own genus again. The true difference between frogs in Dryophytes and Hyla is where they live. Scientists do not think they have important differences in their bodies. Hyla frogs live in the Old World, which is Africa and Eurasia, and most Dryophytes frogs live in the New World, which is the Americas. Only three Dryophytes frogs live anywhere but North America: D. immaculata, D. japonica, and D. suweonensis live in Asia. == Species == The genus Dryophytes has 20 species of frogs in it.
