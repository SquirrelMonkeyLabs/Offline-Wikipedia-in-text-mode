It was a collaboration between Indiana University and Purdue University that gave undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees from both universities. Managed primarily through Indiana University as a core campus and secondarily through Purdue University as a regional campus, it was Indiana's primary urban research and academic health sciences academy. The former IUPUI campus is located in downtown Indianapolis along the White River and Fall Creek. In 2022, the IU and Purdue systems agreed to shut down IUPUI at the end of the 2023–24 school year and replace it with separate universities affiliated with each system.Most academic programs became part of the new Indiana University Indianapolis. The computer science, engineering, and technology programs became part of the new Purdue University in Indianapolis, an extension of the main Purdue campus in West Lafayette. The IUPUI athletic program transferred to IU Indianapolis with a new brand name of IU Indy. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Purdue University Category:Indiana University",
