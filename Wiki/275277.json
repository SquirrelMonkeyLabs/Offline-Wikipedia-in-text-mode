 "text": "Thallium(I) chloride, also known as thallous chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is TlCl. It has thallium and chloride ions in it. The thallium is in its +1 oxidation state. ==Properties== Thallium(I) chloride is a colorless odorless solid. It is very toxic. It is insoluble (does not dissolve) in cold water but dissolves a little in hot water. Otherwise, it is somewhat similar to potassium chloride in being colorless and silver chloride in being insoluble in water. ==Preparation== Thallium(I) chloride is made by reacting any soluble chloride such as hydrochloric acid with thallium(I) sulfate. This makes a thallium(I) chloride solid. It can also be made by reacting thallium metal with hydrochloric acid. ==Uses== It is the result of a certain way to make hexafluorophosphates from chlorides. ==Related pages== *Thallium(I) bromide *Thallium(III) oxide *Thallium(I) carbonate Category:Thallium compounds Category:Chlorine compounds",
