 "text": "Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish writer, poet and playwright. He wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray, and the plays Salomé, The Importance of Being Earnest, An Ideal Husband, and Lady Windermere's Fan. Wilde was bisexual. He had a wife and two children. He had an affair with a younger man named Lord Alfred Douglas. This affair ruined his life. ==Biography== Wilde was born in Ireland in 1854. He went to school at Trinity College in Dublin. Then he went to the Magdalen College (part of Oxford University.) In London, he worked as a journalist for four years. He was very well known in his time. This was because he dressed well and was very good at conversation. He was also well known because he wrote a novel called The Picture of Dorian Gray. He also wrote plays. In 1891, he wrote a play called Salomé. He wrote it in French while living in Paris. No one could perform it in England, because there were characters from the Bible in it. This did not discourage him. He then wrote four comedic plays in the early 1890s. He was one of the most successful playwrights of the time. His masterpiece was the play called The Importance of Being Earnest. When he was very famous, he sued his lover's father for libel (lying about someone in print). There were many trials. In the end, the court sentenced Wilde to two years of work in Reading Gaol (jail). The crime was gross indecency (sexual contact with other men). After he went to prison, his wife went to Switzerland with their children. She changed their last names to Holland. While he was in prison, he wrote a long letter called De Profundis. De Profundis was about his experiences during the trials. It was very sad compared to his earlier work. When he got out of prison, he went to France. He never went back to the British Isles. In France, he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which was a poem about prison. It was his last work. In Paris, he lived in a hotel. He did not have very much money, or very many friends. He died of cerebral meningitis (swelling in his brain) in Paris. He was forty-six. Before he died, he said, \"My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go\".p546 == The affair == Wilde was in a romantic relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas. Douglas was the son of the Marquess of Queensberry. Queensberry argued a lot with his son. He spoke to Wilde and Douglas several times about their relationship. In June of 1894, Queensberry visited Wilde with no warning. Queensberry threatened to beat up Wilde if he saw Wilde with his son in a restaurant again. ==Trials== ===Wilde vs Queensberry=== The Marquess of Queensberry left Wilde a calling card on February 18, 1895. On the card he wrote: \"For Oscar Wilde, posing as a sodomite\".Holland, Merlin, ed 2003. Irish Peacock and Scarlet Marquess: the real trial of Oscar Wilde. New York: Fourth Estate. p300 Sodomy (men having sex with other men) was a crime. This note accused Wilde of having committed a crime. Because of this, Wilde sued him for libel (lying about someone else in print). His friends thought this was a bad idea, but Douglas encouraged him. In the trial, Queensberry only had to prove that Wilde had posed as a sodomite. But he also presented evidence that suggested Wilde had committed sexual acts with male prostitues. On the advice of his lawyer, Wilde withdrew his case. The court decided Queensberry was not guilty. They thought Queensberry was telling the truth when he wrote that Wilde was posing as a sodomite.Trial transcript Because of the Libel Act of 1843, Wilde had to pay Queensberry's lawyers. After this, Wilde was declared bankrupt. ===The Crown vs Wilde=== Wilde left court. The government wanted to arrest him for sodomy and gross indecency. His friends told him to try to flee to France, but his mother said he should stay in England. The government put him in prison before his trial. Douglas visited him daily, until Wilde told him to go to Paris to avoid punishment. Wilde's trial began on April 26, 1895. He pled not guilty. During the trial, he spoke about \"the love that dare not speak its name\". He described it as strong love between an older and a younger man. He said it was misunderstood and that it was the reason he was on trial.Transcript of Wilde's trial, published online by University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School ; See also Ellmann (1988:435) Saying these things was not helpful, because it convinced the jury that he had sex with men. The jury could not decide what to do. His lawyer got the court to agree on a bail.Oscar Fingal O'Fflahartie Wills Wilde, Alfred Taylor, Sexual Offences > sodomy, 22nd April 1895\".

The lawyer for the government wanted to give up the case, but many people knew about it. Another government lawyer thought it was too well known to give up.p435 Wilde went to court again. The court sentenced him to (made him do) two years of work in prison. They also sentenced another man, named Alfred Taylor.Oscar Fingal O'Fflahartie Wills Wilde, Alfred Waterhouse Somerset Taylor, Sexual Offences > sodomy, 20th May 1895\".

Wilde tried to respond to the judge, but others in the courtroom yelled \"Shame\", so that no one could hear him.Sentencing Statement of Justice Wills .
