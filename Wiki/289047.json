 "text": "Monzón is a city in Aragón, in Spain. It is about 60 km east of the capital of the province (Huesca). As of the 2010 census, 17,115 people lived there. The city has a long history. In it, the James I of Aragon was trained in its castle by the knights templar, being a strategic spot between Segre and Cinca valleys. Furthermore, the city owned the Aragonese corts in many times. Cardinal Richelieu and Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares signed a treaty here, ending the conflict over Valtelline in 1626. In the present, Monzón has a sporty tradition, with its slogan Monzón, cuna de deportistas (Monzón, birthplace of sportmen). Among them are Conchita Martínez, the only Spanish woman to win the most important and ancient tournament in tennis, Wimbledon, and Eliseo Martín, bronze medal winner in the 3000m steeplechase in the Paris World Championships (2003) - the only non African athlete to get a medal in those Champìonships since 1993. But Monzon has also been home to Olympic athletes, including Javier Moracho (110 m hurdles) - Spanish record holder for almost 20 years - the decathlete Álvaro Burrell, and the renowned pole vaulter Javier Gazol.
