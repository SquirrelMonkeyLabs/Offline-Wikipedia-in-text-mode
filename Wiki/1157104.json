 "text": "The Battle of Krusi happened on 3rd October, 1796, between the Ottoman army, led by Kara Mahmud Pasha, and the Montenegrin tribes, led by Metropolitan Petar I Petrović Njegoš and Jovan Radonjić. It took place at Krusi in Lješanska nahija. ==Prelude== After Kara Mahmud Pasha was beaten at Martinići in 1796, he planned to attack Montenegro again. He moved his army from Scutari to Podgorica and set up more troops near the border. From Podgorica, he went to Lješkopolje to prepare for an attack on Cetinje. Petar I found out about the plan and set up defenses. He placed most of his army near Sađavce mountain, and another group led by Jovan Radonjić camped near Krusi. One of the first stories about the battle was written by Archimandrite Stefan Vukčević in 1811. ==Battle== The battle took place on October 3, 1796, when Bushati's troops crossed the Sitnica River to attack Montenegrin positions. Russian deacon Aleksije wrote that the battle started at 8:30 am and ended in the evening. After a full day of fighting, the Montenegrins won, killing Bushati. The Ottomans retreated to Podgorica, losing 7,000 men.: \"Војвода Мирко у свом извјештају тврди да је на бојишту остало 7.000 турских лешева, ...\" While Montenegrins had 132 dead and 237 wounded. ==References == == Sources == * * * * * * * Category:18th-century battles",
