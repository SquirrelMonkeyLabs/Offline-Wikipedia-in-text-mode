 "text": "Orlando International Airport is a major international airport in Orlando, Florida. It is the second busiest airport in Florida. Miami International Airport is the busiest. It is the 13th busiest airport in the United States and the 29th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic. The airport serves as a hub for AirTran Airways and as a focus city for Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways. The airport is the home of AirTran's corporate headquarters but the airline has its main hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. Southwest Airlines is the airport's largest carrier in terms of passengers traveled. SWA carried one-fifth of all passenger traffic at the airport in 2006. The airport code MCO stands for the airport's former name, McCoy Air Force Base. It was named for Colonel Michael Norman Wright McCoy, USAF. In the early 1960s, with the creation of commercial jet airline service to the Orlando area, the installation became a civil-military facility. After the Vietnam War, McCoy AFB was to be closed. All Air Force flight operations ended in early 1975. The airport was known as Orlando-McCoy Jetport until being renamed as Orlando International Airport. The Greater Orlando area is also served by Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB). Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB), Melbourne International Airport (MLB), and Tampa International Airport (TPA) are also near by. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== {{Airport

transportation service to all twenty four Walt Disney World resort hotels used to be available. The motor coach service was operated by Mears Transportation and was available to Disney guests with resort reservations. An agreement with BAGS Incorporated also provided checked luggage pickup and delivery system for Disney guests utilizing the Disney's Magical Express service. However, as of January 1st, 2022, Disney World announced the discontinuation of the Magical Express service, leaving guests without this transportation option. Families planning to visit the theme park will now need to seek alternative transportation services, such as a paid ride on either Mears or Sunshine Flyer buses, a rental car, or Uber/Lyft ride share services to reach the most magical place on Earth. ===Cruiseline transportation=== The airport serves as a major inbound gateway for cruise line passengers departing out of Port Canaveral on lines including Royal Caribbean International, Carnival Cruise Lines, Disney Cruise Line, SunCruz Casinos, and Sterling Casinos, all operating motorcoach transportation to Port Canaveral, primarily with partnerships with Mears Transportation. ==References== ==Other websites== * * *Orlando Transportation Services | Private Car Service and Limo Service Category:Airports in Florida Category:Orlando, Florida",
