 "text": "Ramon del Fierro Magsaysay (August 31, 1907 â€“ March 17, 1957) was a Filipino politician. He was the seventh President of the Philippines, from December 30, 1953 until his death in a plane crash. He was elected president under the banner of the Nacionalista Party. ==Presidency== Because of the success of his campaign against the Hukbalahap rebellion, he became popular among the Filipino people. He was elected president under the banner of the Nacionalista Party during the 1953 elections and defeated former president Elpidio Quirino. Under his presidency, his administration involved: * improving public works and social programs especially those in rural areas, *helping the creation of SEATO and the National Marketing Corporation, * and the revision of the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 under the Laurey-Langley agreement. The Laurey- Langley agreement, however, ended up creating a competition between American products and Filipino products. Magsaysay also wished to improve every aspect of Filipino life but was frustrated that his efforts were limited because of a disobedient congress. This resulted on failure of land reforms over which small farmers did not like. He died on March 17, 1957 because of a plane crash near Cebu. His vice president, Carlos P. Garcia, became president. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Presidents of the Philippines Category:Aviation deaths Category:Politicians from Zambales",
