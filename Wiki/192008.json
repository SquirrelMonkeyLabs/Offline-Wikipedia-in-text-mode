 "text": "£sd (pronounced, and sometimes written, L.s.d.) was the popular name for the pre-decimal currencies (sterling) used in the United Kingdom and in most of the British Empire. This abbreviation meant “pounds, shillings, and pence”. It is different when compared to American currency. \"Pound sterling\" has originally meant a troy pound (~373 g) of sterling alloy, consisting of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. The £sd system was originally created by Emperor Charlemagne in the 8th century, putting end to the money chaos of the Dark Ages. It was used all around Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, but it was little by little superseded by decimal currency. It remained in use in the United Kingdom until 1971.
