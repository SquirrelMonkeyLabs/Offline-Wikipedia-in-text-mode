The north east rises steeply from the sea to a height of at Mynydd Enlli.Cycling North Wales : Cycle Ride from Aberdaron Retrieved 2009-08-16 The western end is low and flat farmland. On the south, the island narrows to a peninsula with a lighthouse.Gwynedd Archaeological Trust : Bardsey Retrieved 2009-08-16 It is the fourth-largest island in Wales. Bardsey has several names, including the \"Island of 20,000 saints\". In Welsh the name means \"The Island in the Currents\". In English the name means the \"Island of the Bards\",Samuel Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, 1849, S Lewis and Co, London, 474 pages or possibly the \"Island of Barda\", a Viking chieftain. The island has been an important religious site. In AD 516, Saint Cadfan built a monastery on Bardsey. In medieval times many pilgrims visited the island, and by 1212 the monastery was part of the Augustinian Canons Regular. In 1537 Henry VIII closed the monastery and had the buildings pulled down, but pilgrims still visit the island. Bardsey Island is famous for its wildlife and rugged scenery. A bird observatory was set up in 1953 as the island is on important migration routes. It is a nesting place for Manx shearwaters and choughs. It also has rare plants, and habitats undisturbed by modern farming practices. It is a good place to see grey seals, dolphins and porpoises. The spirituality and sacredness of the island, its relative remoteness, and its legendary claim to be the burial site of King Arthur, have given it a special place in the cultural life of Wales. It has attracted artists, writers and musicians to its shores. It has inspired award winning literature. ==Geology== The island is formed from rocks of the late Precambrian Gwna Group, part of the Monian Supergroup. The rocks are a mélange, often called Gwna Mélange, which have an unusual mix of clasts of all sizes up to 100m across. These are also very varied types, including both sedimentary and igneous rocks. Blocks of sheared granite in the melange can be seen in the northwestern coastal cliffs of the island. In other places there are clasts of quartzite, limestone, sandstone, mudstone, jasper and basalt. The deposit is an olistostrome, a very large underwater landslide possibly caused by an earthquake some time after 614 million years ago. A dolerite dyke of Ordovician age can be seen in the melange at Trwyn y Gorlech in the north. There is an olivine dolerite dyke of Tertiary age at Cafn Enlli in the southeast. Further dykes can be seen in the cliffs at Ogof y Gaseg and at Ogof Hir. A thin spread of glacial till stretches across the centre of the island. This was left behind by the Devensian Irish Sea Icesheet. There is a small patch of blown sand at Porth Solfach on the west coast and a landslip at Briw Cerrig at the foot of the cliffs on the east coast.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map sheet 133 (England and Wales) Aberdaron and Bardsey Island (BGS, Keyworth, Notts) (with 1:10,00 inset map of Bardsey)Howells, M.F. 2007 British Regional Geology: Wales (BGS, Keyworth, Notts) pp15-20 ==History== People lived on the island in Neolithic times, and traces of their hut circles remain. During the 5th century the island became a place of refuge for Christians and a small Celtic monastery existed.Mysterious Britain and Ireland : Bardsey Island Retrieved 2009-08-16 In 516 Saint Cadfan arrived from Brittany and directed the building of St Mary's Abbey.British Broadcasting Corporation : Pilgrims : The Northern Path Retrieved 2009-08-16 In medieval times three pilgrimages to Bardsey Island were said to be equal to one visit to Rome.Aberdaron and District Tourist Link : Places to Visit Retrieved 2009-08-16 In 1188 the abbey was still a Celtic institution, but by 1212 it belonged to the Augustinians. Many people still walk to Aberdaron and Uwchmynydd each year in the footsteps of the saints. Only ruins of the old abbey's 13th-century bell tower remain. A Celtic cross in the ruins commemorates the 20,000 saints claimed to be buried on the island. Saint Deiniol, the bishop of Bangor, was buried on the island in 584. Saint Dyfrig was also buried on Bardsey Island, although in 1120 his remains were moved to Llandaff. The Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, on the orders of Henry VIII, resulted in St Mary's Abbey being closed and its buildings pulled down in 1537.Bardsey Island Trust : The Island : History Retrieved 2009-08-16 The choir stalls, two screens and the bells were moved to Llanengan, where the parish church was then being built. For many years Bardsey Island formed part of the Newborough Estate. Between 1870 and 1875 the island's farms were rebuilt. A small limestone quarry was opened, and a lime kiln set up.Bardsey Island Trust : Landmarks Retrieved 2009-08-16 Carreg and Plas Bach are separate buildings, but the remaining eight were built as semi- detached houses, each pair with outbuildings set around a shared yard. The buildings are Grade II listed.

It was given money by the Church in Wales and many Welsh academics and public figures. The trust gets its money from membership subscriptions, grants and donations. It wants to protect the wildlife, buildings and archaeological sites of the island. It also promotes its artistic and cultural life, and wants people to visit as a place of natural beauty and pilgrimage.Bardsey Island Trust : The Trust Retrieved 2009-08-16 In 2000, the trust advertised for someone to run the sheep farm on the island.

It is believed to be all that is left of an orchard planted by the monks who lived there a thousand years ago. In 1998, experts on British apples said this tree was the only example of the Bardsey Apple (). The tree has been propagated by grafting and is available commercially. ==Bardsey Lighthouse== Bardsey Lighthouse stands on the south end of the island and guides vessels passing through St George's Channel and the Irish Sea.Genuki : A Topographical Dictionary of Wales 1833 by Samuel Lewis Retrieved 2009-08-16 It is the only square lighthouse looked after by Trinity House. Lt. Thomas Evans R.N., asked for a light on the island in 1816. In 1821 Trinity House built the lighthouse at a cost of £5,470 12s 6d with another £2,950 16s 7d for the lantern.Douglas Bland Hague, Lighthouses of Wales Their Architecture and Archaeology, 1994, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, Aberystwyth, 102 pages, Joseph Nelson was the engineer and builder. He had served under Daniel Alexander, a Trinity House architect, whose influence can be seen on parts of the design including the heavy weathered string-course near the base and the blocked and hooded directional-light window. Joseph Nelson is linked to the design of at least 15 lighthouses, mostly in the Bristol Channel. The Lighthouse is built of ashlar limestone and is not plastered. It is painted in red and white bands on the outside. The Lighthouse tower is 30 m (98 ft) high and is unusual because it is square, not round. Unlike many other lighthouses, it has kept its original gallery railings, which are of iron and bellied (i.e. curved out in width at their crowns) towards the top. The present lantern, fitted in 1856, did not need the original railings to be taken down. The walls are 1.2 m (4 ft) thick at the base and 0.9 m (3 ft) at the top. At first, the light had reflectors but changed to a dioptric (refracting) mechanism in 1838. The present lantern of 1856 is a 4.27 m (14 ft) wide chamfered octagon and the light is fixed, instead of revolving. The present revolving apparatus was put in place in 1873. It gives a group of five flashes, at first with an oil-lamp, but changed to electric in 1973. The Lighthouse is unusual in lacking any sort of harbour. As it is on an established migratory route, the tower has many bird casualties. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and Trinity House have tried to help the problem by providing perches on the lantern top and flood-lighting the tower, but this does not seem to have helped. In 1987 the Lighthouse was changed to automatic operation, and is now checked by the Trinity House Depot at Harwich.Trinity House : Bardsey Lighthouse Retrieved 2009-08-16 A local person does regular maintenance. Y Storws, also known as The Boathouse, was built a few years before the lighthouse, near the landing place at Y Cafn. ==Wildlife== The island was made a National Nature Reserve in 1986,British Broadcasting Corporation : Bardsey Island Retrieved 2009-08-16 and is part of Glannau Aberdaron ac Ynys Enlli Special Protection Area ().

Chiffchaffs, goldcrests and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, whitethroats and spotted flycatchers. About 40 species of bird regularly nest on the island, including ravens, little owls, oystercatchers and the rare chough. Hundreds of sea birds, including razorbills, guillemots, fulmars and kittiwakes, spend the summer nesting on the island's eastern cliffs. There are no land predators such as rats or foxes on the island. On a dark moonless night an eerie cackling can be heard across the island as 27,000 pairs of Manx shearwaters, 3.5 per cent of the British population, come ashore to lay and incubate their eggs in abandoned rabbit warrens or newly dug burrows.Joint Nature Conservation Committee : Manx Shearwater, Puffinus puffinus Retrieved 2009-08-16 The island is one of the best places in Gwynedd to see grey seals. In mid summer over 200 can be seen, lying in the sun on the rocks or swimming in the sea. About 15 pups are born each autumn. Their sharp teeth and strong jaws are perfect for breaking the shells of lobsters and crabs which live in the waters. It is also possible to see bottlenose and Risso's dolphins, and porpoises. The currents around the island carry food-rich water. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been carrying out surveys since 1999 to find out which areas are important for feeding and nursing calves. The seas around the island are rich in marine life. There are forests of strap seaweed; in the rock pools are sea anemones, crabs and small fish; and in deeper waters, the rocks are covered by sponges and sea squirts. The yellow star anemone, found offshore, is more common to the Mediterranean. ==Culture== It was tradition for the island to elect the \"King of Bardsey\" (Welsh:Brenin Enlli).

His son, John Williams II, the third of the recorded kings, was deposed in 1900, and asked to leave the island as he had become an alcoholic. At the start of World War I, the last king, Love Pritchard, offered himself and the men of Bardsey Island for military service. He was refused as he was considered too old at the age of 71. Pritchard was angry and declared the island a neutral power. In 1925 Pritchard left the island for the mainland, to seek an easier way of life, but died the following year.Bardsey Island Trust : History Retrieved 2009-08-16 Yorkshire born poet Christine Evans lives half the year on Bardsey Island, spending the winters at Uwchmynydd.
