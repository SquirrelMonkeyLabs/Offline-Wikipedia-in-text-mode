 "text": "Gyalo Thondup (), (1928 â€“ 8 February 2025) was the second-eldest brother of the 14th Dalai Lama. He often acted as the Dalai Lama's unofficial ambassador, and was involved in many political controversies around the Tibetan society. In the later years of his life, Thondup repeatedly said that the only way to achieve progress is with China. In 1998, the Central Tibetan Administration (the political arm of the Dalai Lama's anti-China diaspora faction) criticized Thondup for not letting the Dalai Lama know about the CIA's involvement in Tibet. Thondup died at his home in Kalimpong, West Bengal, India, on 8 February 2025, at the age of 97. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2025 deaths Category:Tibetan people Category:Prime ministers",
