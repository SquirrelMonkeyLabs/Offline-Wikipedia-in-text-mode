 "text": "The DC Universe (DCU) is an upcoming American media franchise and shared universe based on characters from DC Comics publications. It was created by James Gunn and Peter Safran, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of DC Studios. The franchise is a soft reboot of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The DCU will keep some of the cast members of the DCEU while replacing others. For example, cast members such as Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) and John Cena (Peacemaker) will return, with their characters to be put into the new storyline. Others, such as Henry Cavill (Superman), Ben Affleck (Batman), and Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) will see new actors take on new versions of their characters. The story of the DCU is divided into chapters, starting with \"Gods and Monsters\" which will begin in 2024 with the animated series Creature Commandos. Gunn and Safran said the chapter's first movie, Superman (2025), will be the real beginning of the DCU. In June 2023, it was confirmed that a new Batman would appear in the universe in the movie The Brave and the Bold and would be directed by The Flash director Andy Muschietti. This first chapter will include movies about Superman, Batman, Supergirl, The Authority and Swamp Thing. ==Movies== Film U.S. release date Director Screenwriter Producer(s) Status Chapter One: Gods and Monsters Superman James Gunn Peter Safran Filming Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow June 26, 2026 Craig Gillespie Ana Nogueira Pre-production The Authority In development The Brave and the Bold Andy Muschietti James Gunn, Peter Safran, and Barbara Muschietti Swamp Thing James Mangold Other movies Untitled Teen Titans movie Ana Nogueira In development == Television series == Series Seasons Episodes Original release Showrunners(s) Status Chapter One: Gods and Monsters Creature Commandos 1 7 Late James Gunn In production Peacemaker 2 8 James Gunn Filming Waller 1 Christal Henry & Jeremy Carver In development Lanterns 1 Paradise Lost 1 Booster Gold 1 Other series Untitled Arkham series 1 Antonio Campos In development Untitled Blue Beetle series 1 Miguel Puga ==References== Category:DC Comics",
