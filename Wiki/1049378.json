 "text": "Curtained hair or curtains is a simple hairstyle. It has long fringe divided in the middle or a side parting, with short sides and back. This style is mostly for males. It became very popular in Europe, North America, and Japan in the 20th and 21st centuries. ==History== Curtained hair started in the Edwardian era. People used it as a practical alternative to longer hair. It was popular because it was easy to manage during sports like rugby football. This style stayed popular for a long time. In the early 20th century, young working-class men and street gangs also liked this haircut. It was useful in street fights because long hair could be a disadvantage. ==Comeback== In the late 1980s and 1990s, curtained hair came back. Fans of different music styles and bands like The Happy Mondays and Blur popularised it in the UK. Famous people like David Beckham and Tom Cruise also wore this style. In the early 2020s, the hairstyle became popular again because of social media app TikTok and K-pop. Many young people find it attractive. ==In Popular Culture== Many famous actors like Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible 2 and Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic have worn this hairstyle.
