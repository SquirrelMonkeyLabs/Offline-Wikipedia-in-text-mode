 "text": "The Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) is a subspecies of the cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii). It is a freshwater fish in the salmon family (family Salmonidae). It lives in only to a few U.S. states. Its original range was upstream of Shoshone Falls on the Snake River and tributaries in Wyoming, across the Continental Divide in Yellowstone Lake and in the Yellowstone River and its tributaries downstream to the Tongue River in Montana. The species is also found in Idaho, Utah and Nevada. == Description == The Yellowstone cutthroat trout is often golden brown with relatively big spots clustered toward its tail. Its body is compressed like most trout. == Population threats == Their population has decreased a little due to overfishing and mining. The most serious threats are interbreeding with introduced rainbow trout to make cutbows in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem. === Introduction to the Yellowstone River === Yellowstone cutthroat trout were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions. ==References== ==Other websites== * Wyoming Fish & Game Commission website Category:Freshwater fish Category:Salmoniformes Category:Western United States",
