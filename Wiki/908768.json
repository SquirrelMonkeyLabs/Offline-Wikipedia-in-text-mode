 "text": "Nord Stream (, Severny potok) is a system of offshore natural gas pipelines in Europe. They are running under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. It includes two pipelines running from Vyborg in northwestern Russia to Lubmin near Greifswald in northeastern Germany forming the original Nord Stream (also known as Nord Stream 1; and two further pipelines running from Ust-Luga in northwestern Russia to Lubmin termed Nord Stream 2. Russia's gas behemoth Gazprom constructed the pipelines. Nord Stream 1 operated between 2011 and 2022. Nord Stream 2 was finalized in 2021 but remained unused as Germany suspended the project shortly after Russia's extensive invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. On 26 September 2022 Nord Stream 1 and 2 were sabotaged. ==References== Category:Economy of Russia Category:Germany Category:Baltic Sea Category:Pipelines",
