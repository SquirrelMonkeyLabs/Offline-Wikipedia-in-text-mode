 "text": "Speed is a measure. It is velocity but without the direction. == Finding speed == Speed is the distance an object moves in a given amount of time. The distance is never negative. If a train takes 1 hour to travel 100 kilometers, it has a speed of . In fact this is the average speed. During this one hour, the train may become slower and faster, it may even drive backwards. The average speed of an object in a certain time is the distance the object traveled divided by the time. The instantaneous speed is the average speed when the time is very small, almost zero. == Units == There are many units of measurement. Since the 20th century following units were widely used by humans: * miles per hour (mph), * kilometers per hour (km/h), and * meters per second (m/s), which is the SI-unit for speed. Different units are used for different applications. People controlling planes and ships frequently use Knot (speed). Sometimes a Mach number is used. == Range == The smallest speed is . A “negative speed” would be in fact a velocity. The biggest speed is the speed of light. You can write bigger speeds, but they are not possible in this universe. == Read also == * Orbital speed * Speedometer – a thing showing speed * Speed limit – a law telling people a maximum speed * Speed of sound * Wind speed == Sources == Category:Measurement Category:Physical quantity",
