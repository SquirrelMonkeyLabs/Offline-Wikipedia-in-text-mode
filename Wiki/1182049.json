 "text": "According to the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) is a movement that forms the so-called manosphere. ==Overview== The MGTOW movement is seen by many scholars as misogynist, anti- feminist and male supremacist, though it is denied by its followers. * * * * * * ==Origin== The MGTOW reportedly started online in the early 2000s when some bloggers wrote about their desire to avoid women and form a single-gendered society. It gradually became popular with the rise of social media, and was seen as one of the causes for Donald Trump to get elected as the President of the United States in 2016 and 2024. Social media seen as having contributed to MGTOW's popularity include Reddit, which has long been criticized for allowing widespread disinformation and antisemitism IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism : * Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. on its platform. * * * * * ==Beliefs== Scholars claimed that the MGTOW held the following beliefs: * Men should limit their contact with women * All cultures are feminist unless proven otherwise * Third-wave feminism seeks to turn men into objects of women * Double standards that hurt men exist in dating, workplace and the legal system * Western society has been corrupted by third-wave feminism, which seeks to redefine traditional gender roles ==Causes== Scholars claimed that some men supported the MGTOW ideas because of rejection by women, perceived discrimination, unrealistic beauty standards or changing cultural norms. ==Similar movements== The incel movement is seen by scholars as a similar movement to the MGTOW. Followers of the incel movement are called incels. Scholars claimed that the incels believed that they were unable to get sex or any romantic partners. Contrary to public misconceptions, incels can be men, women or non-binary people. ==Reception== Groups associated with the incel or MGTOW movement are often criticized by left-wing academics due to their disagreement with these groups' opposition to certain progressive values. However, many believe that those criticizing the incel or MGTOW movement ignore the cause and effect of their existence. Some critics see those criticism as \"alarmist, inaccurate, and misrepresenting\" the problem. Mass media have also been criticized for their coverage of these groups, some of which directly compare the problem to Islamic terrorism regardless of context. ===Media=== In January 2023, The Times claimed that half of the persons referred to the Prevent, a British counter-extremism programme, were \"incels\" in the year ending March 2021. However, critics pointed out that there was no evidence to support such a claim. ===Government=== ====United Kingdom==== The public data from the UK Home Office showed that only 22~25% of those referred to the Prevent were classified as having \"mixed, unstable or unclear ideology\" (MUU) – a category for anything other than right-wing or Islamist extremism. Among the small percentage of the referred, a small number of them were seen as potential terrorists, with some referrals dropped by specialists as they did not know the definition of incel. ===Academia=== Some scholars emphasized that most incels or MGTOW were lonely, depressed young men, many of whom were neurodivergent, of diverse ages, religions, ethnicities and sexual orientations. The social stigma is said to be refutable but repeatedly promoted by self-declared experts against the \"lonely, depressed young men\". The self-declared experts were also criticized for misusing dubious statistics (e.g. cherry-picking) to support their bias. ==References== Category:21st century Category:Controversies Category:Social movements",
