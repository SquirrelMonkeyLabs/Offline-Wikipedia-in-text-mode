 "text": "Asunta Yong Fang Basterra Porto (born Fang Yong; September 30, 2000 – September 21, 2013) was a Chinese-born Spanish girl. Her body was found in Teo, A Coruña, Galicia, Spain, on 22 September 2013, shortly before her thirteenth birthday. ==Events== Asunta's adoptive parents, Alfonso Basterra and Rosario Porto, were found guilty of her murder on 30 October 2015. The couple drugged her with Lorazepam for three months. They finally asphyxiated her before disposing of her body. The parents, who maintained their innocence, were sentenced to eighteen years in prison. ==Aftermath== ===Investigation=== The coroner determined she had died by asphyxiation. She had been given at least twenty-seven lorazepam pills on the day of her death, more than nine times the normal dosage for an adult. The investigation into the death became known as the Asunta Basterra case (Spanish: Caso Asunta Basterra). ===Perpetrators in prison=== In 2020, Asunta's adoptive Mother died of suicide still being in prison. Every year of her incarceration until her death, she posted obituaries in memory of Asunta. Her adoptive father's sentence is to be concluded in early 2030s. He said that he was to stay the entire sentence in prison to prove his innocence. ==Responses== The case attracted widespread media interest in Spain and around the world. A \"statement of concern\" from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also made. ==Documentary== A four- part documentary series about the case debuted in 2017. It was made available internationally on Netflix in 2019. ==References== Category:2000 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Murdered children",
