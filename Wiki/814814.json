 "text": "Estelle Bennett (July 22, 1941 - February 11, 2009) was an American singer who was in the group the Ronettes with her sister Ronnie Bennett and their cousin, Nedra Talley. Over many years after the group ended, Bennett had anorexia and schizophrenia, and was homeless many times. When the Ronettes were added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, Bennett was too frail to perform, and only said a few words \"I would just like to say, thank you very much for giving us this award. I'm Estelle of the Ronettes, thank you\". Bennett died on February 11, 2009 at the age of 67 from colon cancer. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:2009 deaths Category:African-American singers Category:Singers from New York City Category:Cancer deaths in New Jersey Category:Deaths from colorectal cancer Category:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Category:The Ronettes members Category:People with anorexia",
