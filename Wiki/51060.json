The Mount Rushmore Memorial is a part of the United States Presidential Memorial, which covers and is above sea level (altitude). == History == Before the memorial was carved, the native Lakota Indian Tribes called the mountain \"Six Grandfathers\". Later, the mountain was named after Charles E. Rushmore, a well-known later, after an expedition in 1885. The memorial was carved to help increase tourism in the Black Hills, where the mountain was. Doane Robinson first formed the idea in 1923. Robinson convinced many influential people in the United States government to build the memorial. Congress soon allowed construction to begin. After gaining Congress's approval, Gutzon Borglum, a famous American sculptor, was hired to begin the project. The work of carving the heads began on March 3, 1925. It was completed on October 31, 1941. == References == Category:Mountains of the United States Category:Geography of South Dakota Category:National Memorials of the United States Category:Symbols of the United States",
