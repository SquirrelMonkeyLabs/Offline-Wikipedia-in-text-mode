 "text": "Kurixalus berylliniris is a frog. It lives in Taiwan. People have seen it between 225 and 1250 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog high in the place where the tree branches come together like a roof in forests in Taitung and Hwalien. This frog lays eggs in holes in trees that have water in them. People have seen its eggs and tadpoles in the water. Scientists believe this frog may be threatened by cutting down the forests where it lives, but there is less tree cutting in Taiwan than there was. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Kurixalus eiffingeri, but they changed their minds after looking closely at the frogs' DNA. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
