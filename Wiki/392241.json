 "text": "Azkaban is the jail of wizards in the fiction fantasy series by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter. It holds most of the Death Eaters in prison. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Rowling described Azkaban as \"Cold, dark, and all your greatest memories you can't remember, and all you can think about are your worst.\" Dementors are the guards of Azkaban. Azkaban was inspired by the real inescapable Alcatraz Prison and is named, in part, for the Hebrew word “Abaddon” meaning: “Place of destruction” or “Depths of hell”.
