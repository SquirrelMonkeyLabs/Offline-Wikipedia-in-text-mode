To determine whether the seat would stay in Bristow or relocate to Sapulpa, which was said to be more centrally located, the county, however, called a special election on August 20, 1908. Bristow boasted greater railroad connections and a larger population. Although Bristow alleged there were voting anomalies, Sapulpa won the election. A second vote was held on November 20, 1912, After the election was declared void. Once more, Sapulpa emerged victorious in both the election and the county seat. Category:Cities in Oklahoma",
