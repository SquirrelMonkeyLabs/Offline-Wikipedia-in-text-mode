 "text": "Eggs Benedict is a dish usually served at breakfast. It starts with a lightly toasted English muffin. The muffin is topped with cooked bacon or Canadian bacon, and poached eggs. The dish is completed with a small amount of hollandaise sauce. Many variations on the dish exist. There are several stories about the origin of Eggs Benedict. ==Origin== There are several stories about how Eggs Benedict started. There have been many “Benedicts” who have tried to claim credit for the invention of the dish, but they are all frauds. A “benedict” was slang for a newly married gent who had been single for a very long time. Many of these\"benedict\" did not take well to married life and often sought refuge of strange beds and bedfellows. It is for them that the dish was named. In an interview in The New Yorker magazine in 1942, Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, said that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered \"buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon and a hooker of hollandaise.\" Oscar Tschirky, the maître d'hôtel, was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham and a toasted English muffin for the bacon and toast. Notes: This hasn't been verified at the source, but is instead taken from the letter to Karpf by Cutts Benedict and the page of J.J. Schnebel. Craig Claiborne, in September 1967, wrote a column in The New York Times Magazine about a letter he had received from Edward P. Montgomery, an American living in France. In it, Montgomery related that the dish was created by Commodore E.C. Benedict, a banker and yachtsman, who died in 1920 at the age of 86. Montgomery also included a recipe for eggs Benedict, stating that the recipe had been given to him by his mother, who had received it from her brother, who was a friend of the Commodore. Mabel C. Butler of Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts in a November 1967 letter printed in The New York Times Magazine responded to Montgomery's claim by correcting that the \"true story, well known to the relations of Mrs. Le Grand Benedict\", of whom she was one, was: ==Variations== * Eggs Benedict XVI was created in honour of Pope Benedict XVI by food historian Mary Gunderson in 2005. Benedict XVI was born in Germany, so this variation uses traditional German ingredients. Most importantly the English muffin is replaced by rye bread, while sausage or sauerbraten is used instead of bacon. * Eggs Blackstone substitutes ham for the bacon and adds a tomato slice. Notes: Title of recipe is poached eggs Blackstone. Uses fried slice of flour dipped tomato, minced bacon, poached eggs, and hollandaise. No bread for base. Notes: Located in Mendocino, California. Notes: Located in Ithaca, New York. * Eggs Florentine substitutes spinach for the ham. “Eggs Florentine ($3.95), eggs poached and topped with Hollandaise sauce, served on spinach and English muffin” Notes: Not directly verified. Viewed through Google News Archive snippet view. Notes: Located in Hermosa Beach, California. Notes: Located in Boulder, Colorado. Older versions of eggs Florentine add spinach to poached or shirred eggs Mornay – eggs covered in Mornay sauce. * Eggs Hussarde substitutes Holland rusks for the English muffin and adds Marchand de Vin sauce. Notes: Located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Notes: Located in New York, New York. * Eggs Montreal substitutes salmon for the ham. This is a common variation in Australia and New Zealand. Notes: Located in Auckland, New Zealand. * Eggs Neptune or Crab Benedict substitutes crabmeat for the ham. * Eggs Sardou substitutes artichoke bottoms and crossed anchovy fillets for the English muffin and ham, then tops the hollandaise sauce with chopped ham and a truffle slice. The dish was created at Antoine's Restaurant in New Orleans in honor of the French playwright Victorien Sardou. Notes: Antoine Alciatore left the U.S. in 1874 so that he could die and be buried in France. If the quote be true and the recipe unchanged since inception, eggs Sardou predates eggs Benedict by a good twenty years. First reference returned by a search of the NYT archive for eggs-Sardou/oeufs-Sardou occurs in 1960. First reference returned by a search of Google Books occurs in 1927. First reference returned by a search of the Google News Archive occurs in 1958. Notes: Located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Page viewed differs from archived page in URL and price, but the description was unchanged. “It consists of poached eggs served in artichoke bottoms crossed with anchovy fillets. The eggs are then served with a bit of hollandaise sauce spooned on top, along with a garnish of truffles and/or finely chopped ham. Some recipes call for creamed spinach as a base on which to place the artichokes; a nice idea, but not, I believe, a part of the original.” A more widespread version of the dish starts with a base of creamed spinach, substitutes artichoke bottoms for the English muffin, and drops the ham. “BRENNAN'S EGGS SARDOU” Notes: Located in Bethesda, Maryland. * Artichoke Benedict replaces the English muffin with a hollowed artichoke. Notes: Archive.org doesn't have a copy of the page. The recipe is a near copy of the one provided by the California Artichoke Advisory Board, but scaled up by a factor of twelve and substitutes the company's hollandaise sauce base. * Country Benedict, sometimes known as Eggs Beauregard, replaces the English muffin, ham and hollandaise sauce with a biscuit, sausage patties, and country gravy. The poached eggs are replaced with eggs fried to choice. \"There is Country Benedict, which is two fried eggs with country sausage on biscuits topped with hollandaise sauce.\" Notes: This was viewed through a Google News Archive keyhole, rather than directly verified with its source. Notes: Located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Archived page doesn't match current one. The archived menu item is \"Country Biscuit Benedict\" and the description is slightly different. Notes: Both Big Biscuit restaurants are located in Missouri. * Irish Benedict replaces the ham with corned beef hashAlthough rare in Ireland itself, corned beef and cabbage is a common Irish-American dish, “James O'Shea … this amazing American idea of Irish food: that it's corned beef and cabbage and that's it.” “You'd never see corned beef on an Irish menu” with over half of the 47 million pounds of corned beef sold annually in the United States sold in the two weeks prior to Saint Patrick's Day. “More than 47 million pounds of corned beef are sold annually in the United States, according to FreshLook Marketing, with more than half of the corned beef in the United Sates each year sold in the two weeks prior to St. Patrick’s Day.” or Irish bacon. “Irish Benedict ($7.50): two poached Eggs and corned beef hash on an English muffin covered with hollandaise sauce” Notes: Not directly verified.
