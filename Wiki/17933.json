He is well known for the invention of dynamite and for creating the Nobel Prize. He left instructions in his will that his money should create the Nobel Prize after reading an article in a French newspaper that called him the \"merchant of death\" and said that he would be remembered for his invention of dynamite and its ability to kill more people than ever before. Nobel left 31 million kronor (the Swedish currency) to the awards after his death on December 10, 1896. The artificial element Nobelium is named for him. ==Early life== Nobel was born on October 21, 1833. His father, Immanuel Nobel, was an engineer and inventor. His mother was Andriette Ahlsell Nobel.
