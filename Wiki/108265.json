Unlike Napoleon, Snowball's plans and projects are targeted at improving the quality of Manor Farm. He is a vivacious pig, quick in speech, and a brilliant inventor, because he had the idea to build the windmill. He was the leader and also wanted to be democratic because he wanted that the farm stick together. He payed attention that everyone is treating each other right. Most of the animals like Snowball because of that and because he is very kind and helpful. He also helped other animals to read and write. He also got the ´´Animal Hero, First Classˋˋ prize because he fought against mean farmers and won. Snowball created a flag for the Animal Farm and seven rules. Snowball was forced to leave the farm because Napoleon wanted to get rid of him, to be the one and only leader of Animal Farm. He gets the fault that he destroyed the windmill because Napoleon wants that the other animals do not like him anymore. Napoleon told the other animals that Snowball is a bad pig and that he didn’t had the idea to build the windmill. Napoleon also said so many false facts about Snowball that the othter farm animals start to forget the real Snowball. Even trough he didn‘t destroyed the windmill. Because of all that the animals live now a horrible life. The reason of that is that Napoleon treats the animals wrong, they have to work too much and barely eat. While the pigs live a luxurious life, breaking the rules. Snowball is based on Trotsky of the October Revolution, who was exiled by Stalin and later murdered by the KGB (Soviet secret police) on Stalin's order.
