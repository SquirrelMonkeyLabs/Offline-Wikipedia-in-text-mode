Soldiers on pick-up trucks entered the Soundiata military base in the town of Kati, where gunfire was exchanged before weapons were given from the armory and senior officers arrested. Tanks were seen on the town's streets, as well as military trucks heading for the capital, Bamako. The soldiers captured several government officials including President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta who later the same day resigned and dissolved the government.
