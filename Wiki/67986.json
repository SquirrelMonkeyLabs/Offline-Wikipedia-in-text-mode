If the school costs money, they don't have to pay as much money. A person who stays at a boarding school is called a \"boarder\". In the UK 1% of children go to boarding schools and 13% of private school pupils are boarders. Most boarding schools are private. This means that as well as having to pay to sleep there, students have to pay for their education. In Ghana most secondary schools are boarding. Famous private boarding schools include Eton College, Rugby School and Harrow School in the United Kingdom, Phillips Exeter Academy in the United States and Cornway College in Zimbabwe.
