 "text": "Area code 809 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan. Established in 1958, area code 809 originally served the entire Caribbean region, including Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and other nearby islands. However, due to increasing demand for phone numbers, many regions were split off into new area codes, such as 787 and 939 for Puerto Rico, and 868 for Trinidad and Tobago. As of 1996, it simply covers the Dominican Republic. It was overlaid by 829 in 2005 and 849 in 2009. Category:Area codes",
