 "text": "Misael Eduardo Pastrana Borrero (14 November 1923 – 21 August 1997) was the 23rd President of Colombia from 1970 to 1974. During his four years in office, Pastrana was cautiously progressive. He sought to increase employment opportunities with a famous four-point strategy. He attempted to boost national savings as a way of moving away from dependency on foreign investment and credit, and he extended pensions rights for many people. His son, Andrés Pastrana Arango, later became the 30th President of Colombia. Pastrana died in Bogotá, Columbia on 21 August 1997 of a stroke at the age of 73. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Presidents of Colombia Category:Colombian lawyers Category:Huila Department",
