 "text": "K-Meleon is a free and open-source, lightweight web browser for Microsoft Windows. Unlike cross-platform browsers, it uses the Windows API to create its user interface. Early versions of K-Meleon render web pages with Gecko, Mozilla's browser layout engine. The Firefox web browser and the Mozilla Thunderbird email client also use Gecko. K-Meleon became a popular browser for Windows. It was available as an optional default browser in Europe. After Mozilla deprecated embedding Gecko, K-Meleon continued to use it for several years. K-Meleon 76 uses the Goanna layout engine. Goanna is a fork of Gecko created for the Pale Moon browser. K-Meleon began as a competitor to Mozilla's original internet suite. It had the goal of being faster and lighter. Until 2011, K-Meleon embedded Gecko in a stripped-down interface. Throughout its lifespan, K-Meleon has required small amounts of memory. K-Meleon 76 uses the Goanna fork. It supports platforms no longer supported by Mozilla after their Gecko rewrite. K-Meleon supports older computers and older computer software. It maintains active support for Windows XP and Windows Vista. Customization is another primary design goal of K-Meleon. Users can change the toolbars, menus, and keyboard shortcuts from text-based configuration files. Besides conventional extensions, K-Meleon also supports macros. Macros are small, human-readable extensions. Users can examine, write, or edit them in a text editor. K-Meleon's custom configuration files can trigger macros. Because it is adaptable, experts recommended K-Meleon for internet cafes and libraries in the early 2000s. == Screenshots == == References == * * * (Version 1.0-75.1) * * * (Version 0.7) * * * * * * * * * * * ==Other websites== * K-Meleon Homepage. * Roytam's repositories on GitHub Category:Web browsers Category:Mozilla Category:Free software Category:Microsoft Windows software",
