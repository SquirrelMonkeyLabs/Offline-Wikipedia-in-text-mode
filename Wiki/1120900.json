At one point, the Russian Empire had the largest Jewish population in the world.https://web.archive.org/web/20070328175501/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/table.jsp?table_id=427&volid;=11&title;=STATISTICS In these regions, mostly Ashkenazi Jewish communities thrived and developed many important parts of modern Judaism. They also faced antisemitism, discriminatory policies, and violent attacks called pogroms. Since the beginning of the 21st century, some say there has been a \"renaissance\" in the Jewish community in Russia.
