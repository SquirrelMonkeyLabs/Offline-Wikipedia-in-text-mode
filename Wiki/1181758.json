 "text": "Namayan is one of 27 modern-day barangays in the city of Mandaluyong â€” which in turn was originally a barrio of the ancient river polity of Santa Ana de Sapa. It was the center of a pre-Hispanic kingdom that covered much of the modern city of Manila and surrounding cities in southern and eastern Metro Manila. It was also spelled as Lamayan. Today, Barangay Namayan is located in the western part of Mandaluyong along the Pasig River banks bordering present- day Santa Ana, Manila and the city of Makati. ==Gallery== Image:85Pasig_River_Ferry_Stations_22.jpg Image:85Pasig_River_Ferry_Stations_39.jpg ==References== Category:Namayan",
