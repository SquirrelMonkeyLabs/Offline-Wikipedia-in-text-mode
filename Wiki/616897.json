Miller wrote several books, including Me & John Biffar: A Love Story, which chronicles her friendship with filmmaker John Biffar. Another work, Swing, Baby Swing! follows the evolution of swing dance into the 21st century. Swingin' at the Savoy: The Memoir of a Jazz Dancer was her autobiography. In 2003, Miller was honored with a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts for creating and continuing to preserve “the acrobatic style of swing dancing known as the Lindy Hop”. Miller died at her home in Fort Myers, Florida from heart failure on May 5, 2019 at the age of 99. ==References== ==Other websites== * * *Biography on National Endowment for the Arts site *DC Swing Dancers and Musicians Interview Norma Miller *Norma Miller's oral history video excerpts at The National Visionary Leadership Project Category:1919 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:American dancers Category:American choreographers Category:American movie actors Category:American stage actors Category:American autobiographers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Comedians from New York City Category:Singers from New York City Category:Actors from New York City Category:Writers from New York City",
