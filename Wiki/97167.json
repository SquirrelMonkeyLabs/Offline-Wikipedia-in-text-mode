 "text": "The Kuril Islands (; ; ), also called the , are a group of islands (archipelago) between Russia and Japan. The northern islands are an undisputed part of Russia and four southernmost islands are disputed by Japan. Both countries say that they own the four islands in the south of the group. This disagreement is called the Kuril Islands dispute. Japan is asking for return of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and Habomai subgroup. They say that these islands are being illegally held by Russia. Several political parties in Japan are asking for return of all Chishima Islands. Russia has said that it would return Shikotan and Habomai subgroup in 1956 but Japan did not agree to this agreement because it meant the United States would keep the island of Okinawa. == North-Chishima / North Kurils == * Shumshu (占守島/) * Araido (阿頼度島/Atarasov) * Paramushiru (Paramushiru, Horomushiro / 幌筵島) * Shirinki( 志林規島/Antsiferov) * Makanru (Makanru / 磨勘留島 Makanrusi) * Onnekotan (温禰古丹島/Onekotan) * Harimukotan (春牟古丹島) * Ekaruma ( 越渇磨島/Ekarma) * Chirinkotan (知林古丹島) * Shiashukotan (捨子古丹島 Shaskotan) * Raikoke (雷公計島) * Matsuwa(松輪島 Matuwa) * Rashowa(羅処和島 Rasowa) * Ushishiru ( 宇志知島/Uchicir) * Ketoi ( 計吐夷島/Ketoy) * Simushiru ( 新知島/Shimushir) * Buroton (武魯頓島/Buroton) * Chirpoi (知理保以島/Chirihoy) * Chirihoinan (知理保以南島/Brat Chirpoyev) * Uruppu ( 得撫島/Urup) == South Chishima / South Kuril == * Etorofu (Iturup / 択捉島) * Kunashiri (Kunashiri / 国後島) == Little Kuril == Japan says these are not a part of the Chishima Islands at all (Habomai shoto (歯舞諸島) → 2008.3.21 - Habomai Gunto（歯舞群島）): * Shikotan （色丹島） * Todo/Kaiba（海馬島), Lisii/Shishki * Taraku(多楽島), Polonskogo * Shibotsu(志発島), Zelyoni * Yuri (勇留島) * Akiyuri(秋勇留島), Anuchina * Harukaru (春苅島), Dyomina * Suishō （水晶島), Tanfilyeva * Kaigara(貝殻島), Signalny ==Related pages== * Provinces of Japan * Prefectures of Japan * List of regions of Japan * List of islands of Japan * Chishima Islands dispute Category:Pacific islands Category:Islands of Japan Category:Islands of Russia Category:Territorial disputes",
