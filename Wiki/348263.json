New World direct-developing frogs (Anura: Terrarana): molecular phylogeny, classification, biogeography, and conservation. Zootaxa 1737: 1-182. There are 185 species of Eleutherodactylus. Many of them are commonly called \"rain frogs\" or \"robber frogs\". This is because of their sharp, high-pitched, and insect-like calls. The common coquí (Eleutherodactylus coqui) is the best known species. They are a national symbol of Puerto Rico. They are also an invasive species in the US state of Hawaii. Two Eleutherodactylus species, E. limbatus and E. iberia, belong to the smallest known frogs. They measure only 8½ mm in length. == References == Category:Frogs",
