 "text": "A lunar base, moon base, or lunar colony are a (planned) research station, resort or similar establishment on the Moon. Construction of outposts on the Moon, is thought to be helpful for testing how to build settlements on other planets and natural satellites. The Moon is only 360,000 kilometers or 250,000 statute miles away from the Earth. ==Plans that are led by the U.S, and by China== There are plans for building outposts. \"Humankind's first settlement of the Moon [is expected to go from, or] will progress from pressurized landers and rovers to ... bases that look like the International Space Station\", according to media (2024).https://www.aerospacetestinginternational.com/news/space/what-will-the- first-moon-bases-really-be-like.html. Retrieved 2025-05-12 === Project led by the United States === The Artemis program has scheduled several landings (with humans onboard), at the Moon's south polar region. Artemis III is planned for [2027] at the earliest. The mission is supposed to have two astronauts land on the surface of the Moon, for a stay of about one week. During later space flights, five temporary base camps are supposed to be created. Those bases are supposed to use the Human Landing Systems (HLS);Artemis VIII is planned to set up the Foundational Surface Habitat (FSH) of the Artemis Base Camp in the 2030s; That thing is supposed to be (staying in one place, or) fixed. === China-led project === Making an International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) on the Moon, is expected to happen some time after Chang'e 7, and 8, as well as the Russian missions Luna 26, and 27.Jessie Yeung (10 March 2021) China and Russia agree to build joint lunar space station Flights in regard to the construction of ILRS, are expected to begin after the Chang'e 8 mission has finished; That flight is supposed to happen no earlier than 2028. ==Other ideas about moonbases== In regard to construction of a moonbase inside lava tubes on the Moon: Arguably the best moon colony option would be to place it within one of the Moon's lava tubes (or lunar lava tube), where it would be protected from radiation, micrometeorites, and the wild temperature swings due to the lack of any substantial atmosphere and the lunar day being 672 hours long.https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/lunar-lava-tube-could- shelter-a-future-moon-base/.
