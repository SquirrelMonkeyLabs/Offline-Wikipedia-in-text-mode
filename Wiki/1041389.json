 "text": "The fast-calling shrub frog (Raorchestes drutaahu) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists saw this frog in Kodaikanal in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1000 and 1450 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in special forests called shola forests and in the grassy places just outside the forests. They saw the frogs .5 to 1.4 meters above the ground. People have also see them in tea farms. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpoles. Scientists think that humans cutting down the forests to make tea farms could be bad for this frog and that chemicals meant to kill pests could kill the frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
