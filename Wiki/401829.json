 "text": "Jayne Mansfield (born Vera Jayne Palmer; April 19, 1933 – June 29, 1967) was an American actress and Playboy Playmate. A sex symbol of the 1950s and 1960s, Mansfield was known for her numerous publicity stunts. She won a Theatre World Award and Golden Globe Award, and was dubbed as of Hollywood's \"smartest dumb blonde.\" Mansfield gained popularity after playing the role of fictional actress Rita Marlowe in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1955–1956). Her other film roles include the musical comedy The Girl Can't Help It (1956), the drama The Wayward Bus (1957), the neo-noir Too Hot to Handle (1960), and the sex comedy Promises! Promises! (1963). Mansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public relations businessman Paul Mansfield. Mansfield married three times, each marriage ending in divorce, and had five children. On June 29, 1967, she died in a traffic collision at the age of 34. ==Early years== Mansfield was the only child of Herbert William Palmer (1904–1936) and Vera Jeffrey Palmer (1903–2000). She was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Her father was of German descent and her mother was of English descent. After her father's death in 1936, Jayne, her mother, and stepfather Harry Lawrence Peers moved to Dallas, Texas. After high school graduation, she studied acting at Southern Methodist University and the University of Texas at Austin. While in college, she had a number of small jobs such as hat check girl and nightclub photographer. She won many beauty pageants. She performed in local theater productions around Austin. ==Career== In 1955, Mansfield went to New York City. She appeared in the Broadway production of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? The critics praised her performance. She appeared in 400 plus shows of the play between 1955 and 1956. She went to Hollywood in 1956. 20th Century Fox signed her to a six-year contract in an effort to replace the troubled Marilyn Monroe.

On television, she made guest appearances on drama series, game shows, variety shows, and many talk shows. Mansfield was one of Hollywood's original blonde bombshells. When the demand for big-breasted blonde bombshells decreased in the early 1960s, she became a box-office has-been. She remained a popular celebrity however.

Mansfield became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood movie. The movie was Promises! Promises!.

He was tried in Chicago city court on obscenity charges, but was acquitted. ==Personal== Mansfield married public relations professional Paul Mansfield in 1950.

Matteo Ottaviano, né Thomas Vitale Ottaviano) in 1964. They had one son, Antonio Raphael Ottaviano (Tony Cimber). The couple separated in 1966. Their divorce was pending when Mansfield was killed in 1967. ==Death== Mansfield was killed in a car crash in June 1967.
