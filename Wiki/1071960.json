 "text": "The Australia–New Zealand soccer rivalry is a soccer rivalry between the Australia men's national soccer team (the Socceroos) and the New Zealand men's national football team (the All Whites), as well as between the Australia women's national soccer team (the Matildas) and the New Zealand women's national football team (the Football Ferns). It is one of many sports rivalries between Australia and New Zealand, which are rivalries because the two countries are close to each other and are culturally very similar. The first match New Zealand played was against a team representing the state of New South Wales, with New Zealand losing 1–0 before playing them again and drawing 3–3.https://www.rsssf.org/tablesn/nsw-nz-1904.html The first official international match for both teams was played in 1922. New Zealand won the match 3–1. This led to the creation of the Soccer Ashes. Australia is by far the more successful team in both men's and women's soccer matches. ==Overall summary== Men's Team Australia 67 43 11 13 160 70 +90 New Zealand 67 13 11 43 70 160 –90 Women's Team Australia 53 35 8 10 95 43 +52 New Zealand 53 10 8 35 43 95 –52 ==Related pages== * Australia–New Zealand relations * Australia–New Zealand sports rivalries ==References== New Zealand Soccer Category:Football rivalries in New Zealand",
