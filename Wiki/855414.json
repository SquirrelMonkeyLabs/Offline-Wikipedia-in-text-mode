 "text": "Cuban art has been known since the 16th century. In the 16th century, painters and sculptors began arriving from Europe. They made decorations (including paintings and sculptures), in Cuban churches and public buildings. By the mid-1700s, native-born artists were painting in Cuba, in the European tradition of painting.

He was opposed to Cuban independence, and that cost him some of his popularity with the public.Cernuda Arte: Víctor Patricio Landaluze http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/victor-patricio- landaluze/; retvd 1 31 16 ==After the Colonial Era== By the late 1920s [an Avant-garde movement,] the Vanguardia, had rejected convention [or some norms] of Cuba's national art academy. Most of the Vanguardia artists had been students at the national art academy. Many had lived in Paris (France), where they learned (more) about Surrealism, Cubism, and modernist Primitivism. Those genres (or styles) gave inspiration to the Vanguardia artists.Ades, Dawn. Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820-1980\\. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989: 7. Pioneer s (or the first to be part) of the movement included Eduardo Abela, Antonio Gattorno, Victor Manuel, Fidelio Ponce de León, and Carlos Enríquez Gómez.Eduardo Abela Cubanet Other famous artists of the original Vanguardia were Amelia Peláez, Jorge Arche, Marcelo Pogolotti, Aristides Fernandez, Rafael Blanco, Domingo Ravenet, Alberto Peña, and Lorenzo Romero Arciaga.

During stays in Paris, he had been impressed by the works of Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin. (The painting is in a museum in Havana, Cuba.) Between 1934 and 1940, Cuba was searching for its cultural identity in its European and African roots. The landscape, flora, fauna, and lore of the island, as well as its peasants - the often neglected, but important part of Cuba's soul and economy - was shown, more and more, in its art.Cruz-Taura, Graciella; Fuentes-Perez, Ileana; Pau-Llosa, Ricardo. Outside Cuba. New Jersey: Office of Hispanic Arts Mason Gross School of the Arts, 1988: 44. In 1938, the Second National Salon of Painting and Sculpture, showed art works. Some of the artists there, have been called part of a second generation of modern artists, including Cundo Bermudez, Mario Carreño, Rita Longa, Alfredo Lozano, Luis Martinez-Pedro, and René Portocarrero The painting The Jungle (1943) has been called a masterpiece (or a painting by a master) of Cuban art.

In 1951 in Paris (France), an exhibition of modern Cuban art was shown at the Musée National d'Art Moderne. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, some artists made a decision to leave Cuba. Because the creation of art, was sponsored (or paid for) by the Cuban government, implied censorship occurred, since artists wouldn't want to make art that was against the government that was financing (or paying for) the art.Padura Fuentes, Leonardo. \"Living and Creating in Cuba: Risks and Challenges\".
