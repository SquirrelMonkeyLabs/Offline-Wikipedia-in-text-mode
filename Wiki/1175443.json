 "text": "Pass laws is the name for a number of laws and regulations, that were in use in South Africa, and neighboring countres during the era of Apartheid. The idea was to control the movement of the black population, mainly the black workforce. The basis was mainly the Native Urban Areas Act, introduced in 1923. These laws also segregated the population based on race, they only applied to black people. The laws were valid until 1986, when they were abolished. Using these laws, areas were defined where the different racial groups (mainly blacks) were allowed to live and work. The pass laws only applied to men; making them cover women failed several times. In summary they are based on laws introduced in the 17th and 18th century introduced by the British and the Dutch to regulate slave economy in the Cape Colony. Category:Apartheid",
