 "text": "WordPress Photo Directory is an open-source image directory for open images. It is managed by the WordPress project. ==Images== All images are licensed under an open CC Zero license. Images are created and uploaded by volunteers. The service is still partially under development stage. The program used in it is licensed under the GNU GPLv2.0 license. ==Mission== The image directory aims to provide an open alternative to closed image banks, such as Unsplash, Pixbaby, and Adobe Stock, whose licensing terms have become restrictive in recent years. Use in WordPress themes, for example, is restricted. ==Statistics== WordPress Photo Directory has 2,388 images as of April 2022. == History == On December 14, 2021, Matt Mullenweg announced the WordPress Photo Directory at State of the Word 2021 event. In January 2022, the project began to gather volunteers and already in February its own developer website was launched. Then team representatives were selected. == Related pages == * Open content * WordPress * WordPress Foundation * Wikimedia Commons == References == == Other websites == * * WordPress Photo Directory developer site * WordPress Photo Directory developer handbook * WordPress Photo Directory API * WordPress Photo Directory in the Git repository * This Week in WordPress #194 â€“ WP Builds, discussion among other about WordPress Photo Directory Category:Archives Category:Photography Category:WordPress",
