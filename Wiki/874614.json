Innamorato was unopposed in the 2018 general election. She later said: \"My district, which I know is like white working class, poor folk, who are racist, because it’s so much easier for them to look to their side and say, ‘I’m going to blame that person.'\" The Costa campaign head Gary Britcher then said that Innamorato had called the district \"racist\". Innamorato's point was that white working class voters \"are being exploited from all sides\" by economic and political elites who play on racial tensions to distract them from issues of economic injustice. \"Racism exists everywhere,\" she said. \"My job is to represent everyone, and to not shy away from tough conversations.\" Innamorato got almost 85% of the vote in the general election. ;2020 Innamorato's opponent was Stephen Zappala III for the Democratic Party nomination.
