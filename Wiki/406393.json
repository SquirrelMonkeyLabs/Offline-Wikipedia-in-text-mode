 "text": "Godey's Lady's Book was a 19th-century American monthly women's magazine. It began publication in 1830 as The Lady's Book. \"Godey's\" was added to the title about 1840. It was also known as Godey's Magazine. It was published in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Louis Antoine Godey. In 1836, Godey bought the Boston-based American Ladies' Magazine, and merged it with his own magazine. Sarah Josepha Hale became the literary editor. Contents included recipes, etiquette, health advice, fiction, poetry, fashions, household tips, exercises, moral instruction, etc. The monthly fashion plates were hand- colored by 150 women. Unusual for the times, the magazine's contents were copyrighted. Subscriptions dropped off during the American Civil War, though the magazine was careful not to mention politics, war, or other divisive or controversial topics. Public interest in the magazine declined after Godey and Hale retired. The magazine was absorbed by Puritan in 1898. ==References== * Godey's Lady's Book: Publication History * Encyclopaedia Britannica: Godey's Lady's Book Category:American women's magazines Category:American monthly magazines Category:Defunct magazines of the United States",
