 "text": "An acrolith is a type of sculpture or carved art. In an acrolith, the outermost parts, for example the head, hands and feet, are made of stone, and the rest is made in a different material. The different material is usually wood or something else that can wear out or rot, so it does not survive. Museums and other collectors often have only the stone parts. They are often separated from each other. Pausanias, a Greek traveller and geographer who lived during the 2nd century A.D., talked about acroliths. == Examples == * Athene Areia of the Plataeans * Antinous Mondragone * Colossus of Constantine * Hera Farnese * Augustus, dea Roma, Tiberius, Livia from Leptis Magna in Libya == References == Category:Sculpture Category:Ancient Greek statues",
