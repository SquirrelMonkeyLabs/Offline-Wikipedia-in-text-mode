 "text": "The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star was the first fighter jet of the United States Army Air Force. It made a few flyovers of Germany in the last weeks of World War II. From 1948 its designation was changed to F-80 Shooting Star. Early in the Korean War the MiG-15 was shown to be much better and the F-86 replaced it. The United States Air Force was the main operator, but Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Uruguay also used it. This aircraft was the basis of the famous training aircraft T-33 T-Bird and the F-94 Starfire fighter jet. Category:United States Air Force aircraft P-80",
