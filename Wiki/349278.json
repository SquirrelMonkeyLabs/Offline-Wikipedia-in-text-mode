Fourteen contestants will live in the house and compete for $250,000. The premiere was on June 18, 2012. On May 4, 2012, broadcasting company CBS told ABC not to air The Glass House. This was because CBS thought it was the same as their reality television series Big Brother. Nineteen people who used to work on Big Brother are working on The Glass House. On May 10, 2012, CBS started a lawsuit against ABC. ==References== Category:2012 American television series debuts Category:American reality television series Category:English-language television programs",
