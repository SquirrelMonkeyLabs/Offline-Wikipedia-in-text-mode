 "text": "The EFL Cup, known for most of its history as the Football League Cup and also known in the past by several sponsored names, is a national association football competition in England, with a few clubs in Wales also playing. It is like the FA Cup, but has fewer teams, and starts and ends earlier in the season. Unlike the FA Cup, which is open to hundreds of clubs belonging to The Football Association, which runs football in England, the EFL Cup is open only to the 92 teams in the top four divisions of English football—those playing in the top-level Premier League and the English Football League, which includes the next three lower divisions. == Winners == Note: * means after extra time === 1961–1966 (two legs) === Year Home Team Score Away Team Venue 1961 Rotherham United 2 - 0 Aston Villa Millmoor Aston Villa 3 - 0* Rotherham United Villa Park Aston Villa won 3-2 on aggregate won 3-2 on aggregate 1962 Rochdale 0 - 3 Norwich City Spotland Norwich City 1 - 0 Rochdale Carrow Road Norwich City won 4-0 on aggregate won 4-0 on aggregate 1963 Birmingham City 3 - 1 Aston Villa St Andrews Aston Villa 0 - 0 Birmingham City Villa Park Birmingham City won 3-1 on aggregate won 3-1 on aggregate 1964 Stoke City 1 - 1 Leicester City Victoria Ground Leicester City 3 - 2 Stoke City Filbert Street Leicester City won 4-3 on aggregate won 4-3 on aggregate 1965 Chelsea 3 - 2 Leicester City Stamford Bridge Leicester City 0 - 0 Chelsea Filbert Street Chelsea won 3-2 on aggregate won 3-2 on aggregate 1966 West Ham United 2 - 1 West Bromwich Albion Upton Park West Bromwich Albion 4 - 1 West Ham United The Hawthorns West Bromwich Albion won 5-3 on aggregate won 5-3 on aggregate ===Since 1967 (single game)=== 1967 Queens Park Rangers 3 - 2 West Bromwich Albion Wembley Stadium 1968 Leeds United 1 - 0 Arsenal 1969 Swindon Town 3 - 1* Arsenal 1970 Manchester City 2 - 1* West Bromwich Albion 1971 Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 0 Aston Villa 1972 Stoke City 2 - 1 Chelsea 1973 Tottenham Hotspur 1 - 0 Norwich City 1974 Wolverhampton Wanderers 2 - 1 Manchester City 1975 Aston Villa 1 - 0 Norwich City 1976 Manchester City 2 - 1 Newcastle United 1977 Aston Villa 0 - 0* Everton Aston Villa 1 - 1* Everton Replay - Hillsborough Stadium Aston Villa 3 - 2* Everton Replay - Old Trafford 1978 Nottingham Forest 0 - 0* Liverpool Wembley Stadium Nottingham Forest 1 - 0 Liverpool Replay - Old Trafford 1979 Nottingham Forest 3 - 2 Southampton Wembley Stadium 1980 Wolverhampton Wanderers 1 - 0 Nottingham Forest 1981 Liverpool 1 - 1* West Ham United Liverpool 2 - 1 West Ham United Replay - Villa Park 1982 Liverpool 3 - 1* Tottenham Hotspur Wembley Stadium 1983 Liverpool 2 - 1* Manchester United 1984 Liverpool 0 - 0* Everton Liverpool 1 - 0 Everton Replay - Maine Road 1985 Norwich City 1 - 0 Sunderland Wembley Stadium 1986 Oxford United 3 - 0 Queens Park Rangers 1987 Arsenal 2 - 1 Liverpool 1988 Luton Town 3 - 2 Arsenal 1989 Nottingham Forest 3 - 1 Luton Town 1990 Nottingham Forest 1 - 0 Oldham Athletic 1991 Sheffield Wednesday 1 - 0 Manchester United 1992 Manchester United 1 - 0 Nottingham Forest 1993 Arsenal 2 - 1 Sheffield Wednesday 1994 Aston Villa 3 - 1 Manchester United 1995 Liverpool 2 - 1 Bolton Wanderers 1996 Aston Villa 3 - 0 Leeds United 1997 Leicester City 1 - 1* Middlesbrough Leicester City 1 - 0* Middlesbrough Replay - Hillsborough Stadium 1998 Chelsea 2 - 0* Middlesbrough Wembley Stadium 1999 Tottenham Hotspur 1 - 0 Leicester City 2000 Leicester City 2 - 1 Tranmere Rovers 2001 Liverpool 1 - 1* Birmingham City Millennium Stadium Liverpool won the 2001 final 5-4 on penalty kicks. 2002 Blackburn Rovers 2 - 1 Tottenham Hotspur 2003 Liverpool 2 - 0 Manchester United 2004 Middlesbrough 2 - 1 Bolton Wanderers 2005 Chelsea 3 - 2* Liverpool 2006 Manchester United 4 - 0 Wigan Athletic 2007 Chelsea 2 - 1 Arsenal 2008 Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 1* Chelsea Wembley Stadium 2009 Manchester United 0 - 0* Tottenham Hotspur Manchester United won the 2009 final 4-1 on penalty kicks. 2010 Manchester United 2 - 1 Aston Villa Villa 2011 Birmingham City 2 - 1 Arsenal 2012 Liverpool 2 - 0 Cardiff City Liverpool won the 2012 final 3-2 on penalty kicks. 2013 Swansea 5 - 0 Bradford 2014 Manchester City 3 - 1 Sunderland 2015 Chelsea 2 - 0 Tottenham Hotspur 2016 Manchester City 1 - 1* Liverpool Manchester City won the 2016 final 3-1 on penalty kicks. 2017 Manchester United 3 - 2 Southampton 2018 Manchester City 3 - 0 Arsenal 2019 Manchester City 0 - 0* Chelsea Manchester City won the 2019 final 4-3 on penalty kicks. 2020 Manchester City 2 - 1 Aston Villa 2021 Manchester City 1 - 0 Tottenham Hotspur 2022 Liverpool 0 - 0* Chelsea Liverpool won the 2022 final 11-10 on penalty kicks. 2023 Manchester United 2 - 0 Newcastle United 2024 Liverpool 1 - 0* Chelsea 2025 Newcastle United 2 - 1 Liverpool",
