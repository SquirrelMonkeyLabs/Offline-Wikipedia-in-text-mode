 "text": "The House of Bonaparte was an imperial and royal European dynasty founded by Napoleon I of France in 1804, a Corsican military leader who rose to power and transformed the French Republic into the French Empire. The dynasty ruled from 1804 to 1815 and again from 1852 to 1870. == Napoleon I of France == Napoleon Bonaparte is the most significant person associated with the Bonaparte family because he created the First French Empire that conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century. He was elected as first consul of France on November 10, 1799 with the help of his brother, Lucien Bonaparte, speaker of the Council of Five Hundred. He later crowned himself Emperor of the French in December 2, 1804 and King of Italy in May 26 1805. He then made his elder brother Joseph (1768–1844) king of Naples (1806–1808) and then of Spain (1808–1813), his third brother Louis, king of Holland (1806–1810), and his youngest brother Jerome Bonaparte, king of Westphalia(1807-1813). Napoleon's son Napoleon François Charles Joseph (1811–1832) was created king of Rome (1811–1814) and was later styled Napoleon II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication. Charles Louis Napoléon (1808–1873), son of Louis Napoléon, was president of France in 1848 and emperor in 1852 until 1870, reigning as Napoléon III. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme. == Crowns held by the family == === Emperors of the French === * Napoleon I (1804–1814, 1815), also King of Italy (1805–1814) * Napoleon II (1815), styled King of Rome from birth, but never reigned * Napoleon III (1852–1870), nephew of Napoleon I and son of Louis I of Holland File:Gros - First Consul Bonaparte (Detail).png|Napoleon I File:Nap- receis 50.jpg|Napoleon II File:Napoleon3.PNG|Napoleon III === Kings of Holland === * Louis I (1806–1810) * Louis II (1810), also Grand Duke of Berg (1809–1813) File:1778 Louis Napoleon.jpg|Louis I File:Napoléon Louis Bonaparte (1804-1831).jpg|Louis II === Kings of Naples === * Joseph I (1806–1808) * Joachim I (1808–1815), also Grand Duke of Berg (1806–1808) File:Joseph Bonaparte (by Wicar).jpg|Joseph I File:Murat2.jpg|Joachim I === King of Westphalia === * Jérôme I (1807–1813) File:Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte.jpg === King of Spain === * Joseph I (1808–1813) === Grand Duchess of Tuscany === * Elisa Bonaparte (1809–1814) File:Prud'hon-Elisa Bonaparte.jpg Category:House of Bonaparte Bonaparte, House of Category:1804 establishments in Europe Category:1852 establishments Category:1850s establishments in Europe Category:1870s disestablishments in Europe Category:1810s disestablishments in Europe",
