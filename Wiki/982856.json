 "text": "Ichthyodectiformes is an extinct order of marine stem-teleost ray-finned fish. They were most diverse throughout the Cretaceous period. You can see their \"bulldog\" appearance, which is why they are also called bulldog fish. Ichthyodectiforms are usually considered to be called like that because of their unique appearance. There is evidence that at least one species, Xiphactinus audax, may have been endothermic (\"warm-blooded\"). == Classification == === Bardackichthyidae === * †Bardackichthyidae Hacker & Shimada, 2021 ** †Amakusaichthys Yabumoto et al., 2020 ** †Bardackichthys Hacker & Shimada, 2021 ** †Heckelichthys Taverne, 2008 === Chuhsiungichthyidae === * †Chuhsiungichthyidae Yabumoto, 1994 ** †Chuhsiungichthys Lew, 1974 ** †Jinjuichthys Kim et al., 2014 ** †Mesoclupea Ping & Yen, 1933 == Description == The Ichthyodectiformes resembled sea monsters due to their monstrous appearance. Their face resembled that of a bulldog, which is a dog breed. That is why they are called bulldog fish. === Saurodon === Saurodon was quite different from other ichthyodectiforms, because the lower jaw projected in front of the upper. === Xiphactinus === Xiphactinus was one of the largest prehistoric fish ever. In 1982, Carl Baugh found a solitary \"Y-shaped\" fossil that he called Unicerosaurus while he was excavating. == References == # Nelson, Joseph S.; Grande, Terry C.; Wilson, Mark V. H. (2016).
