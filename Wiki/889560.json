 "text": "Causantín mac Cuiléin (, 4 April 954 – 3 July 997) often known as Constantine III and also nicknamed the Bald () was the King of Scotland from 995 until his death in 997. The son of King Culen of Scotland (Cuilén mac Iduilb), Constantine succeded his distant relative, King Kenneth II (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim) in 995. Constantine apparently led a successful rebellion agaisnt Kenneth due to killing Constantine's father 24 years earlier in 971. Just like his predecessors, during Constantine's reign, the kingdom mainly fought off the vikings. He also had control over many other kingdoms and greatly expanded Scotland. In 997 two years after becoming king, Constantine was killed in another rebellion led by his distant relative, Cináed mac Dub who immediately became king as Kenneth III. Apparently, Kenneth killed Constantine in revenge of what Constantine's father did to Kenneth's father, King Dub (Dub mac Maíl Coluim). Category:997 deaths Category:Kings and Queens of Scotland",
