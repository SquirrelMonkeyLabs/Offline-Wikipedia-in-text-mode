The town is very old. It was started around 700 AD. The town centre has almost the exact same medieval street plan and over 660 listed buildings. Many of these buildings have timber framing from the 15th and 16th centuries. There is also Shrewsbury Castle, which was built in 1074, and Shrewsbury Abbey, which was built in 1083. The town centre is almost completely surrounded by the River Severn. Charles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury and lived there for 27 years. The population of Shrewsbury is just over 76,000, making it the second largest town in Shropshire, the biggest being Telford. The town has a railway station and a professional football club, Shrewsbury Town, who compete in League One.
