 "text": "The Alto de Buey poison frog, golden poison frog, or golden poison-arrow frog (Andinobates altobueyensis) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground and in bromeliad plants in forests on the mountains. Scientists do not know whether it can live in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. People have seen this frog between 980 and 1070 meters above sea level. ==Name== The frog's English and Latin names are for Alto del Buey, the mountain where scientists found the frog. ==Young== Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground and that the adults bring the tadpoles to water in bromeliad plants because this is what other frogs in Adinobates do. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out. They have not seen it since the 1970s, but no one went to search for it carefully. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Utria National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
