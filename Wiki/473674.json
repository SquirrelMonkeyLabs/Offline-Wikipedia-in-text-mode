 "text": "Insulated glazing, otherwise known as double glazing or triple glazing, refers to the layers of glass in a window. A double glazed window is two panes of glass (also called a lite) with a sealed air (or gas) space in the middle.Ernst Neufert; Peter Neufert; Johannes Kister, Architects' Data (Chichester; Ames, IA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012), p. 105 The edges are sealed together with an air-tight spacer. This is used so that heat cannot escape through the air space by conduction or convection. Heat radiation is not affected as it can travel through a vacuum space. To increase the R-value of insulated windows are sealed with argon gas.Floyd Vogt, Carpentry (Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, 2014), p. 650 == References == Category:Energy conservation Category:Windows (architecture)",
