 "text": "Adam Guy Riess (born December 16, 1969) is an American astrophysicist. He works at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. He is known for his research in using supernovae as cosmological probes. Riess shared both the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Brian P. Schmidt for \"providing evidence that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating\". This means that the expanding Universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. In 2020, Riess was appointed a Fellow of the American Astronomical Society. == Highly cited articles == These articles have each been cited over 1900 times. * 1998 with V Filippenko, P Challis, A Clocchiatti, A Diercks, et al., Observational evidence from supernovae for an accelerating universe and a cosmological constant, in: The Astronomical Journal.
