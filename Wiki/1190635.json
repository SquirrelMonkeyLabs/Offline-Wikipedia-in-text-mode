 "text": "The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted idea about how the universe began. It says that the universe started as a very small, hot, and dense point around 13.8 billion years ago, and has been expanding ever since. \\---- === Early Ideas About the Universe === Long ago, people believed the universe was unchanging and had always existed. In the early 20th century, many scientists—including Albert Einstein—also thought the universe was static (not expanding or shrinking). However, in 1922, a Russian scientist named Alexander Friedmann used Einstein's equations of general relativity and showed that the universe could be expanding. His ideas were not accepted at first, even by Einstein. \\---- === Expanding Universe and Hubble’s Discovery === In 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble made a big discovery. He saw that galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther away they are, the faster they move. This meant the universe was actually expanding, just like Friedmann had predicted. This supported the idea that the universe started from a smaller state and grew larger over time. \\---- === The Name “Big Bang” === The term “Big Bang” was first used by British scientist Fred Hoyle in 1949 during a radio broadcast. He didn’t like the idea and used the term to mock it, but the name stuck. Hoyle believed in a different idea called the steady state theory, which said the universe was always the same and new matter was constantly being created. However, more evidence later supported the Big Bang theory. \\---- === Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) === In 1965, two scientists, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, accidentally discovered a faint signal from space. This was the cosmic microwave background radiation—the leftover heat from the early universe. This discovery gave very strong support to the Big Bang theory and helped it become the main theory of how the universe began. === Modern Support and Developments === Since then, many discoveries have helped improve and support the Big Bang theory. These include: * Detailed maps of the CMB radiation, * Observations of galaxy formation, * Studies of dark matter and dark energy. Today, the Big Bang theory is the foundation of modern cosmology, the study of the universe’s origin, structure, and future. \\---- === Conclusion === The Big Bang theory has changed how we understand the universe. From Friedmann’s equations and Hubble’s observations to the discovery of cosmic background radiation, the theory has grown with new evidence. It helps explain how the universe started and how it has changed over billions of years. \\---- === Related Pages: === * Big Bang (Main article explaining the theory, history, and evidence) * Timeline of the Big Bang (Detailed timeline from the origin of the universe to the present) * Lambda-CDM model (Current standard model of cosmology based on the Big Bang theory) === Important Scientists: === * Alexander Friedmann (Proposed the expanding universe using Einstein’s equations) * Edwin Hubble (Discovered galaxies moving away – proof of expansion) * Georges Lemaître (Proposed the idea of the \"primeval atom,\" similar to the Big Bang) * Albert Einstein (His general relativity laid the foundation for cosmological models) * Fred Hoyle (Coined the term “Big Bang” and opposed the theory at first) * Arno Penzias & Robert Wilson (Discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation) === Scientific Concepts & Discoveries: === * Cosmic microwave background (Radiation left over from the early universe, key evidence) * Redshift (Used by Hubble to show galaxies are moving away) * Hubble's law (The speed of galaxies increases with distance – supports expansion) * FLRW metric (Mathematical model of the expanding universe) * Steady State theory (Rival theory to the Big Bang, now mostly abandoned) ---- === References === # NASA – What is the Big Bang? https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/big-bang/en/ (Easy-to-understand summary by NASA's Space Place, suitable for students.) # NASA – Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) Mission https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/ (Details about the mission that confirmed the cosmic microwave background radiation.) # Einstein Online – Expanding Universe https://www.einstein- online.info/en/spotlight/cosmology_expanding/ (From the Max Planck Institute, explains the expanding universe and Friedmann’s equations.) # Encyclopædia Britannica – Big Bang Model https://www.britannica.com/science/Big-Bang-model (Thorough article on the history, evidence, and development of the theory.) # University of Cambridge – Fred Hoyle and the Big Bang https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/bb_orig.html (Details the historical debate between the Big Bang and Steady State theories.) # NASA – Cosmic Microwave Background https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_tests_cmb.html (Explanation of why the CMB supports the Big Bang theory.) # HubbleSite – Edwin Hubble’s Discovery https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/the-expanding-universe (Describes how Hubble showed the universe is expanding.)",
