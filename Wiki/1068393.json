 "text": "Puran Appu's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus puranappu) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Sripada Peak in the Peak Wilderness, between 1800 and 2100 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 33.6 â€“ 34.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 51.5 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is light brown in color with a dark red stripe from the nose to the rear end. The stripe can look like an hourglass. The sides of the body can be pink or yellow in color. The legs are dark brown-green in color. There is a mark between the eyes. This frog is active at night, but people have seen it during the day. It sits on rocks in the shade. Like other frogs in Pseudophilautus, this frog hatches from its egg as a small frog. It never swims as a tadpole. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities, to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
