 "text": "\"Cover Me\" is a 1984 song by Bruce Springsteen and is the second single from his seventh studio album Born in the U.S.A.. There is no music video made. It went to number 6 in Ireland, number 7 in New Zealand and the United States, number 12 in Canada, number 13 in Finland, number 15 in Sweden, number 16 in the United Kingdom and number 17 in New Zealand. ==Track listings== ===7-inch single=== #Cover Me – 3:26 #Jersey Girl – 6:15 with an edited spoken introduction, or at 6:10 without a spoken introduction. The B-side of the single, \"Jersey Girl\", was a live performance of a Tom Waits song, recorded on July 9, 1981, at Meadowlands Arena. Springsteen had introduced the song earlier in that special River Tour homecoming stand that opened the arena, slightly rewriting it to replace a Waits line about \"whores on Eighth Avenue\" and adding a verse that included \"that little brat of yours and drop[ping] her off at your mom's.\" \"Jersey Girl\" would become a Springsteen fan favorite, although played rarely as time went on. This same recording would later be released as the closing track of Live 1975-85. Differing pressings of the single had different lengths of \"Jersey Girl\", sometimes dropping most of a spoken introduction of 0:31 seconds in length. The UK 12-inch single contains the full-length version with the complete spoken introduction at 6:36. Both the sleeve and label erroneously state a playing time of 5:50. ===12-inch single=== #\"Cover Me\" (Undercover Mix) – 6:09 #\"Cover Me\" (Dub 1) – 4:02 #\"Cover Me\" (Radio Mix) – 3:46 #\"Cover Me\" (Dub 2) – 4:15 ===CD single (1988)=== #\"Cover Me\" – 3:26 #\"Pink Cadillac\" – 3:33 == References == Category:1984 songs Category:Rock songs Category:Bruce Springsteen songs",
