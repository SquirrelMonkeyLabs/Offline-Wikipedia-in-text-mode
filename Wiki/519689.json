 "text": "A gene family is a set of several similar genes. They occur by the duplication of a single original gene. Usually they have similar biochemical functions. The idea that genes get duplicated is almost as old as the science of genetics.Taylor, John S. & Raes, Jeroen 2004. Duplication and divergence: the evolution of new genes and old ideas. Annual Review of Genetics 38: 615-643. One such family are the genes for human haemoglobin subunits. The ten genes are in two clusters on different chromosomes, called the α-globin and β-globin loci. These two gene clusters are thought to have arisen from a precursor gene being duplicated, about 500 million years ago. The biggest gene family is said to be the olfaction genes.Niimura Y. & Nei M. 2003. Evolution of olfactory receptor genes in the human genome. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 100 (21): 12235–40. The homeobox genes are another important group. Bürglin T.R. Affolter M. 2015.
