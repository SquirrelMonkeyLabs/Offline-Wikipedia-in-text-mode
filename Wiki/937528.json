She has been called the \"grandmother of Juneteenth\". Lee was born in Marshall, Texas. She studied at the University of North Texas. Lee campaigned for many years to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. She began a lead to walk each year, representing the 2.5 years it took for news of the Emancipation Proclamation to reach Texas. At the age of 89, she walked from Fort Worth, Texas to Washington, D.C., leaving in September 2016 and arriving in Washington in January 2017. She was hoping to inspire President Barack Obama to make Juneteenth a holiday. On June 17, 2021, President Joe Biden signed Senate Bill S. 475, making Juneteenth the eleventh federal holiday. Lee was at the White House for the signing. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Lee began working at a food bank, farm and community garden during the pandemic to help communities affected by it. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:Living people Category:American teachers Category:American political activists Category:Educators from Texas Category:People from Fort Worth, Texas",
