 "text": "Münchausen syndrome (pronounced \"MUNCH-house-in\") is a mental illness in which a person repeatedly fakes being ill to get attention or sympathy from others. The illnesses being faked can be physical and/or psychological. ==Overview== Münchausen syndrome sometimes called factitious disorder imposed on self, hospital addiction syndrome, thick chart syndrome, or hospital hopper syndrome. ==Related mental illnesses== A related mental illness is Münchausen syndrome by proxy. People with this condition abuse another person, usually a child, in order to get sympathy or attention for themselves. For example, a parent might make their own child sick in order to get attention and sympathy from friends and medical professionals.Grace, Eunice; Jagannanthan, Nithya (2015). Munchausen syndrome by proxy: A form of child abuse. International Journal of Child and Adolescent Health 8 (3): 259-263. Nova Science Publishers, Inc. ISSN 1939-5930. ==Symptoms== People with Münchausen syndrome exaggerate or create symptoms of mental or physical illness. Some people with Münchausen make up detailed stories about medical problems they have had, or they may fake symptoms. However, others may harm themselves in many different ways in order to make it seem like they are sick. For instance, they might take laxatives to make it seem like they have diarrhea, or take blood-thinning medications to cause bleeding. They might inject themselves with bacteria so that they get an infection. They might cut or burn themselves in order to create wounds. Sometimes, after getting medical treatment, people with Münchausen also do things to slow down or prevent their recovery - for example, by ripping out stitches. The goal of this behavior is to get treatment, attention, sympathy or comfort from medical professionals. For someone with Münchausen, being a patient feels familiar and comfortable. This meets a deep psychological need that the person has. ==Risk factors== There are several risk factors for Münchausen (things which make it more likely for a person to develop the condition). Münchausen is more common in people who: * Have low self esteem * Have a personality disorder * Had a serious illness during childhood * Wanted to work in a medical job, but failed * Went through some kind of trauma during childhood * Did not have their emotional needs met during childhood, because a parent or caregiver had a physical or mental illness ==Types== A few different types of Münchausen syndrome have been identified, which include: * Arrythmogenic Münchausen, in which people fake or cause themselves to have cardiac arrythmia (where the heart beats in ways that are not normal)Vaglio JC, Schoenard JA, Saavedra PJ, et al.
