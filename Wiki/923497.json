He studied the smell of Alpine Trees for five years in Canada. Sämann developed methods to get essential oils from ever-green trees and started an oil company. He sold the interest from the company in 1946. In 1952, a milk driver in Watertown, New York complained to him about the smell of spilled milk. Because of this, he invented Little Trees. == References == Category:1911 births Category:1999 deaths Category:German inventors",
