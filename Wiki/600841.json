 "text": "Carmen Lydia Djuric (17 April 1936 â€“ 9 October 2017), known by her artist name Hessie, was a Cuban textile artist. She lived in France from 1962 until her death. Her creative work was mainly focused on using fabrics, although she also used the technique of collage with waste materials. Hessie did not attend any art school and developed her own creative technique as early as 1956 with materials that were both affordable and easily available. Fabrics and textile cuts were materials she used from the beginning. Hessie died in Pontoise, France on 9 October 2017 at the age of 81. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:2017 deaths Category:French artists Category:People from Santiago",
