 "text": "A referendum on powers of the Welsh Assembly was held in Wales on 3 March 2011. Voters were asked if they wanted the Welsh Assembly to make laws in all the areas it is in charge of. The question was: ‘Do you want the Assembly now to be able to make laws on all matters in the 20 subject areas it has powers for?’ At the time, the Assembly could make some laws (Acts of the Assembly) on its own, but needed approval from Westminster for all others. The rules for the referendum and the powers involved were set out in the Government of Wales Act 2006. The results were announced on 4 March 2011. Overall, 63.49% voted 'yes' and 36.51% voted 'no', with 21 out of 22 local areas voting in favour. The voter turnout was 35.2%. The referendum was not legally binding but allowed the Welsh Government to make an order giving the Welsh Assembly more powers. This order was made on 30 March and started on 5 May 2011, the same day as the Assembly election. == References == Category:Articles containing Welsh-language text",
