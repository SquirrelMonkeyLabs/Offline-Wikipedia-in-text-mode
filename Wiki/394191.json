 "text": "Compound words are words that add together to make a new word, like the word side and walk, to make sidewalk. These words often develop over time. They can start as two words joined with a hyphen, and then become a compound word. There are three types of compound words; closed, hyphenated and open. A closed compound word is joined into one word like keyboard or makeup. A hyphenated word is two words joined with a hyphen like mother-in-law. Open compound words are words which are used together like police station, or fire engine. ==Common compound words== This is a list with some common compound words. * airplane * baseball * basketball * bedroom * butterfly * cupcake * firefighter * firefly * football * handbag * headphones * ice cream * jellyfish * keyboard * lighthouse * lipstick * mailbox * moonshine * notebook * pancake * peppermint * popcorn * rainbow * snowball * sunglasses * sunflower * teapot * toothache * toothbrush * toothpaste * toothpick * waterfall * newspaper ==References== Category:Grammar",
