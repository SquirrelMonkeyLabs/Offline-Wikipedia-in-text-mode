 "text": "A value judgement (or value judgment) is an opinion of the rightness or wrongness or usefulness of something. It is based on what a person thinks or prefers. Value judgments are not true or false. This is because they are not objective. They are decisions about how a person thinks or feels, or about what action a person thinks should be taken. They are opinions. A typical dictionary definition runs: :\"A perspective towards a person, object, principle etc. based on how one values [its] properties or characteristics\".Reber A. & E. 2001.
