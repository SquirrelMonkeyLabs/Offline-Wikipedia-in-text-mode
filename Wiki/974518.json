TeleRadyo Serbisyo is also simulcasted via The Filipino Channel (TFC) and it can be heard and viewed online via its YouTube channel and iWantTFC. TeleRadyo was also included as a digital subchannel on digital terrestrial television seen via the ABS-CBN TVplus digital TV receivers and other digital TV boxes, until its discontinuation on November 1, 2022. The channel was previously used to simulcast the programs of ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station, DZMM 630 before the latter went off the air on May 5, 2020 due to a cease and desist order of the National Telecommunications Commission together with ABS-CBN, S+A, and MOR Philippines. The channel went back on-air and online on May 8, 2020 as TeleRadyo, resuming the programming of the former DZMM. On June 28, 2021, TeleRadyo started to broadcast in high-definition feed on YouTube and Facebook while selected shows are being broadcast on Kapamilya Channel and The Filipino Channel in HD. The channel rebranded to TeleRadyo Serbisyo on June 30, 2023 coinciding with the launch of its radio counterpart Radyo Patrol Serbisyo under the joint venture of Prime Media and ABS-CBN. An international feed called TeleRadyo Serbisyo Global is also available worldwide as part of TFC premium channels via cable, satellite, iWantTFC and TFC IPTV. ==Related pages== * DWAN MMDA TeleRadyo * One PH * DZRH News Television * One Sports * BEAM TV * TV5 * ABS-CBN * DWIZ TeleRadyo 27 * ABS-CBN S+A * DWBL-AM * DWBM-FM * DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 (ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station) * ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs (ABS-CBN's news division) * DZMM Radyo Patrol Serbisyo 630 (ABS-CBN's AM radio station under joint venture with Prime Media Holdings) *DZRB-AM *DZRP ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Television channels in Asia Category:2007 establishments in Asia",
