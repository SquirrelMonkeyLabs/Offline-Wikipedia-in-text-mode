 "text": "The Misfits were a punk rock band from New Jersey. They are usually classified as a hardcore punk or horror punk band. They often played in theatrical makeup to look spooky. They had themes mostly from old movies, especially horror movies. The lead singer was Glenn Danzig. Danzig later formed Samhain and then Danzig. Other members went on to form a new version of the Misfits in the late 2000s. That version eventually included members of the Ramones and Black Flag. The Misfits had many of their records released in limited collectible versions. Sometimes they were released through their fan club called The Fiend Club. They had a huge influence on everything from the way punk is marketed (the Misfits rival Kiss in marketing of their skull logo) to the many celebrities wearing their T shirts.
