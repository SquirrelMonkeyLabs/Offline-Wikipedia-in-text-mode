Kieran O'Neill, Sophia Hayes & Ben Phillips opened the company in December 2007. Playfire was the first website to release a PlayStation gamercard. It attracted a big number of gamers. The site brought in an automatic tracking of Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC gameplay in March 2011. == Investment == Playfire got £1.3m in funding from investors such as Niklas Zennström (the founder of Skype), Michael Birch (the founder of Bebo), Chris Deering (the former Chairman of SCE), William Reeve (the founder of LOVEFiLM) and others. == History == The idea for Playfire came from watching the gamers adding information about themselves such as their PSN ID, recently played games, and other things in their signatures under every forum post. In September 2011 Playfire united with GameSpot to bring Playfire users profile to GameSpot through an API collaboration. On 9 July 2012 Playfire was bought by Green Man Gaming. At the end of 2013, Green Man Gaming said that Playfire service was able to track in-game achievements/trophies and gameplay on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. In January 2014, Playfire started its Rewards BETA. the Rewards BETA motivated users to link their Steam account to their Playfire account in order to earn Green Man Gaming store Credit. Available Rewards are listed daily on the Playfire Rewards. Page and by May 2014, over one million Rewards had been given out to BETA participants Playfire was the sponsor of the Most Played Game Award at the 32nd Golden Joystick Awards, and sponsored the Gamers' Choice Award at the Games Media Awards 2014 in October 2014. In blog post on 7 November 2016, Green Man Gaming said that Playfire is closing. It will be united with their new \"Community\" site that GMG made on the Muut platform.
