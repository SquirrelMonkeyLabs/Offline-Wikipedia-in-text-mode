Absorbing the remaining Deccan Sultanates, specifically the Adilshahi and Qutubshahi kingdoms, into the Mughal Empire, weakening the growing Maratha kingdom, led by Sambhaji. The Deccan wars began in 1680 with annexation of Golconda and Bijapur, Execution of Maratha King Sambhaji and ended with the death of Aurangzeb. It resulted in a stalemate for the both sides as the Mughals were able to Annex Bijapur and Golconda but failed to annex and subdue the Marathas, who rose to power even after the Capture of Sambhaji under the leadership of many successful rulers and generals such as Rajaram I, Shahu I, Bajirao I and Madhavrao I winning battles against the Mughals and eventually placing a puppet ruler i.e Shah Alam II as the Mughal Emperor under the leadership of the Maratha general, Mahadji Shinde ==Conquest of Deccan Sultanates== ===Capture of Bijapur=== In 1685, Aurangzeb sent his son Muhammad Azam Shah with a large army to capture Bijapur Fort, which was defended by 30,000 men under Sikandar Adil Shah. Despite initial efforts to surround the fort and position artillery, the Mughal forces faced challenges, including a deep moat, strong fortifications, and powerful Bijapur cannons like the \"Malik-i-Maidan.\" Maratha forces led by Melgiri Pandit further disrupted Mughal supply lines. The situation worsened when a cannonball struck a gunpowder depot, killing 500 Mughal soldiers. To relieve the siege, Aurangzeb sent reinforcements under Abdullah Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang, who successfully repelled Maratha attempts to resupply the fort. However, the siege stalemated, and in July 1686, Aurangzeb himself led a large army to Bijapur. After eight days of intense fighting, the Mughals breached the fort’s defenses, captured Sikandar Adil Shah, and took control of the city. ===Capture of Golconda=== In 1687, Aurangzeb laid siege to Golconda Fort, home to the Qutb Shahi ruler, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, and the world's only diamond mine, the Kollur Mine. The fort was heavily fortified, with an 8-mile wall and iron-spiked gates to deter Mughal elephants. Despite the Mughal bombardment, including massive cannons like the Azhdaha-Paikar, the defenders, led by Abul Hasan, resisted fiercely, even using bamboo rockets. However, heavy rains, food shortages, and disease weakened the defenders. After eight months, a traitor named Sarandaz Khan revealed a backdoor, allowing the Mughals to breach the fort. Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung was among the first to enter and capture Abul Hasan, who was later imprisoned in Daulatabad Fort. Following the siege, the Mughal forces took control of the Kollur Mine, and the fort was repaired with stronger defenses. Anup Singh, who led the final assault, was honored with the title Maharaja by Aurangzeb. ==Maratha-Mughal Wars== ===Under Sambhaji (1680-1689)=== Sambhaji, born in 1657 to Shivaji and Saibai, became the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire after his father's death in 1680. He faced numerous challenges, notably resisting Mughal expansion led by Emperor Aurangzeb. Sambhaji's forces clashed with the Mughals across southern India, with key engagements at forts like Ramsej, Kalyan Bhiwandi, Mysoreand Janjira. In 1681, Sambhaji disrupted Aurangzeb’s supply routes by attacking Portuguese- held Goa and Burhanpur.Despite the Mughal siege of Maratha territories, the Marathas mounted fierce defenses, including repelling Mughal advances on Raigad and thwarting a pincer strategy in 1683–1685 Shah Alam's Invasion was hateled by Sambhaji even wounding Shah Alam. After Aurangzeb's successful conquest of Bijapur and Golconda in 1686, the Marathas launched counterattacks, including an offensive on Bharuch, Wai here Hammbirrao Mohite lost his life which is considered a key factor for capture of Sambhaji.

As soon as death of Aurangzeb reached Marathas they recaptured all the territories annexed by him. Thus his campaign against Marathas resulted in a complete vain as he gained nothing from it. ==Aftermath== After the Battle of Delhi and Battle of Bhopal in 1737, the Marathas expanded into Malwa and by 1757 had reached Delhi. Meanwhile, the Mughal Empire fractured into regional kingdoms, with the Nizam of Hyderabad, Nawab of Oudh, and Nawab of Bengal asserting nominal independence. The Nizam, aiming to protect his Deccan territories and weaken Mughal influence, encouraged Maratha invasions of Malwa and northern India, using them to his advantage. The Mughal–Maratha Wars weakened both empires, contributing to the Mughal decline and the rise of the Marathas as a major power, while also creating space for European colonial powers to establish themselves in India. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:1680s Category:1690s Category:1700s in Asia Category:Battles involving India",
