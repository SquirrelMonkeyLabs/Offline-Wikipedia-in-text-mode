 "text": "Anomaloglossus blanci is a frog. Scientists found it in French Guiana. ==Body== The adult male frog is 15.9-18.8 mm long from nose to rear end. ==Taxonomy== Scientists used to think this was the same species as A. degranvellei. ==Home== This frog lives in rocky and sandy streams. Scientists saw it between 50 and 200 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in one protected place: Parc Amazonien de Guyane. ==Young== The males sit near streams and call to the female frogs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. They have not seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on the frog, but because the disease chytridiomycosis has killed other amphibians in French Guiana, they think it could have killed many of these frogs too. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
