 "text": "Hospitality Club (HC) is a free hospitality exchange service. It provides places for people to stay, usually when traveling. The service is a gift economy. The people who provide a place for people to stay can not ask for payment for the services. Hospitality Club runs off of a reputation system. In HC, members can leave references about how good the service was. People who use it are usually asked to check each other's passports. This usually does not happen. As of March 2022, the site HC had over 325,000 users from 207 countries. The company was founded in 2000 by Veit KÃ¼hne. ==Related pages== *Couchsurfing == Other websites == * A podcast about hospitality club on German RTL * == References == Category:Social networking",
