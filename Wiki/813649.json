 "text": "In video games, a level (also called a map, mission, stage, course, or round in some older games) is an area that the player plays in while trying to complete an objective. Video game levels usually get harder over time to appeal to players who are good at the game and players who are bad at the game. Each level in a video game might introduce new concepts to keep the player interested so that they play for longer. In some games, levels are parts of a larger world, like Green Hill Zone. Games may also feature levels that represent different locations and are connected to each other. In platformers, levels function like obstacle courses. Players must safely jump between platforms to reach the next area. These puzzles can slow the momentum down for players of fast action games. ==References== Category:Video game terminology",
