 "text": "Satellite DNA has many sections of repeating, non-coding DNA. Satellite DNA is a type of tandem repeat. The repeats sit next to each other, in tandem. These are multiple copies of the same base-pair sequence lying end-to-end.Burt A. & Trivers R. 2006. Genes in conflict: the biology of selfish genetic elements. Harvard University Press. \"Tandem Repeats\" p364/6 & p582.\"Copies of base-pair sequences may be repeated one after another along a chromosome: for example the 40S rRNA genes in somatic cells of toads, of which there are about 500 copies\". Adapted from Biology-Online.org Tandem Repeat at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Tandem repeats also include minisatellite and microsatellite DNA. Satellite DNA is the main component of centromeres. It forms the main part of heterochromatin. The most common type of tandem repeat is the heterochromatin, which sits on chromosomes around the centromeres and elsewhere. It is \"transcriptionally inactive\", meaning, it does not code for proteins.King R.C et al 2006. A dictionary of genetics. 7th ed, Oxford University Press, p202/3.Myers P.Z. 2007.
