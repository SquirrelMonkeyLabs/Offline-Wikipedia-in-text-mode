He became a warrior at the late age of 29. When he arrived in Kyungsang-do province as the navy commander of western part of Jeolla-do province in 1592, he predicted the war with Japan. He disciplined the navy tightly and made the turtle ship, which had at least five different types of cannon and had a fully covered deck with iron spikes to shield from cannon fire and attempts to board the ship, for preparation of the war. In the early days of the war he was successful. At the Battle of Chilchonryang, in 1597 most of Joseon Navy's ships were destroyed and he was killed. == References == * http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b17a0061a * http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_6JOb_A1540_1_0007770 * http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=120173 Category:Korean people Category:1540 births Category:1597 deaths",
