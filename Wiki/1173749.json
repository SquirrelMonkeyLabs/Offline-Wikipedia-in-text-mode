In 1929 he left Vkhutemas after his third year and did not resume his studies. In the summer of 1937 he lived wiith his family in a small town of Tarusa not far from Moscow and worked with Yugoslav-Montenegrin Communist émigré poet Radule Stijenski (1901–1966) on the translation of his poem “Cradle of Warriors”. But in November 1937 he was arrested after Radule Stijenski informed the NKVD of his impudent utterances about pecuilarities of Soviet life and politics, and sentenced to eight years of hrd labour. However, in 1939 Steinberg's mother implored the Supreme Court of the USSR to review his case, and in November 1939 the sentence was overturned and Arkady Steinberg returned to Moscow and to freedom.Аркадий Штейнберг.
