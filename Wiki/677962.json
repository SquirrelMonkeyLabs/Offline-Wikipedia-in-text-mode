 "text": "The Upside is a 2019 American comedy-drama movie directed by Neil Burger and written by Jon Hartmere. It is a remake of the French 2011 movie The Intouchables. It was inspired by the life of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo. The movie is about a paralyzed billionaire (Bryan Cranston) who becomes friends with a recently paroled convict (Kevin Hart) who he hires to take care of him. Nicole Kidman, Golshifteh Farahani, Tate Donovan, Aja Naomi King and Julianna Margulies also star. It is the third remake of The Intouchables after the Indian movie Oopiri and the Argentinian movie Inseparables (both 2016). The movie was originally to be distributed by The Weinstein Company in March 2018, but the movie was shelved and sold off following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. It was released in the United States on January 11, 2019. The Upside has grossed over $69 million and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Hart and Cranston's chemistry and performances but criticized the plot for being \"predictable and clich√©\". ==References== Category:2017 movies Category:2019 movies Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:Movies directed by Neil Burger",
