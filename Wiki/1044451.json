 "text": "Domestic Data Streamers (DDS) is a creative research and design studio. Founded in Barcelona in 2013, the studio is known for producing interactive installations and exhibitions that combine media and technology to generate critical conversations. == History == DDS began in 2013 as an art collective following the success of an interactive street art installation. It was created by the eventual founders: Pau Garcia, Dani Pearson, Alexandra de Requesens followed by the later incorporation to the partners team of Joan Planas, Axel Gasulla, Pol Trias and Martina Nadal. The first years of the studio explored the idea of data physicalisation through street installations. They then moved on to different museums and cultural institutions. In 2017 they expanded to study participatory processes, working with institutions like UNICEF and UNWoman. They appeared in museums like the California Academy of Sciences, the Design Museum in Barcelona and became partners of TED talks. They lectured in several international universities focussing on the political and ethical implications of the use of data, data storytelling and data art. In 2019, they launched the Master in Data & Design , at ELISAVA, school of design and engineering of Barcelona. The course explores the possibilities of data physicalisation and participatory research. In 2021 they started an art residency HeyHuman! The project focusses on encouraging artists to combine data research with their creative practice. In 2022, after researching indoor air quality in schools and hospitals in Barcelona they started the spin off group 16 Times. 16 Times builds tools to visualise and improve air quality in indoor spaces. They push for better regulation of indoor spaces, specifically for the most vulnerable in society. == References == Category:Organizations based in Barcelona",
