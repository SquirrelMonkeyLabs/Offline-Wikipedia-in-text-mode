 "text": "Undetectable AI is an artificial intelligence detection computer program created by Bars Juhasz that was created to find content created by AI, and rewrite AI generated text to make the text more human. The Undetectable AI software has been criticized for the chance students could use it to cheat by making their AI generated essays harder to identify. The Undetectable AI software has been tested by researchers, and used in case studies to identify celebrity apologies that appeared to be written by AI. Since the software launched in May of 2024, according to an article published by Life and Style magazine, the software has amassed a user base of four million people. == References == Category:Generative artificial intelligence Category:Software Category:Web software == Other websites == Undetectable AI - Website",
