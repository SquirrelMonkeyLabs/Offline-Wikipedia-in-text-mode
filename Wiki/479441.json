In 1990, he moved to Spain where he would spend the rest of his career, starting with Rayo Vallecano in Segunda División. In his second season with the Madrid side, Agbonavbare appeared in all 38 league games (3,332 minutes of playing time, 27 goals conceded, second-best in the competition) as the team finished second and returned to La Liga after two years of absence. He continued to be first-choice in the following years, contributing with 31 matches to another top-flight promotion in 1995. In 1995–96, Agbonavbare lost his starting position to Spanish international Abel Resino. In the following summer, he signed for second division side Écija Balompié, being the most used player in his position but suffering team relegation. After one year in his country training to remain fit, Agbonavbare retired due to lack of offers at only 31. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Category:1966 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Nigerian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:1994 FIFA World Cup players Category:Deaths from bone cancer Category:Cancer deaths in Spain",
