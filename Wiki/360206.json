 "text": "Softly, Softly is a British television drama series. It was produced by the BBC and screened on BBC 1. It ran from January 1966 to November 1969. It revolved around the work of regional crime squads, plain-clothes CID officers based in the fictional region of Wyvern. It was about characters from the popular police series Z-Cars. In 1969, to match the BBC's move to colour broadcasting on BBC 1, the series changed. The main characters were promoted and moved to the South East of England. The series was going to change its name to Taskforce. The BBC did not want to drop a popular brand and it became Softly, Softly: Taskforce. ==Cast== *Stratford Johns -- DCS Charlie Barlow /...
