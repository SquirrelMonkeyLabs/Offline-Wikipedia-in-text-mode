 "text": "Al-Masih ad-Dajjal ( , \"the false messiah\", or \"the deceiver\") is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology.Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Al-DajjƒÅl, p. 43. He is to appear, pretending to be al-Masih (i.e. the Messiah), before Yawm al-Qiyamah (the Day of Resurrection). According to Islamic belief, at the end of days he will gather together everyone he has deceived into a great army.Theresa Bane, Encyclopedia of Demons in World Religions and Cultures (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., Publishers, 2012), p. 16 His army will then confront the Messiah and his army. The Dajjal is not mentioned directly in the Qur'an.Oliver Leaman, The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia (London; New York: Routledge, 2006), p. 165 This may be because he is only human and is mentioned in the future. == References == Category:Islam Category:Asian mythology",
