 "text": "Insight Hospital and Medical Center, formerly known as Mercy Hospital and Medical Center is a 292-bed general medical and surgical Catholic teaching hospital in Near South Side, Chicago, Illinois. It was built in 1852. The hospital was the first chartered hospital in Chicago. In 1859, Mercy Hospital became the first Catholic hospital to affiliate with a medical school—Lind Medical School—and the first to require a graded curriculum. Mercy also is the hospital used by the Daley family: all of their children were born there. Mercy sold a plot of land to the north of their hospital for 60 million dollars in 2008. It is also the main women's cancer center in Illinois. It accepted patients from Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center and absorbed the ambulance routes when the hospital closed in 2008. In 2012, Mercy Hospital and Medical Center was ranked #35 for all hospitals in the State of Illinois and #27 in the Chicago metropolitan area by U.S. News & World Report. On November 19, 2018, four people were shot near the hospital. Robert Francis Prevost, the future Pope Leo XIV, was born at Mercy in 1955. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Chicago Category:University hospitals in the United States Category:1852 establishments in the United States Category:1850s establishments in Illinois",
