 "text": "Brucamps is a commune. It is in the region Hauts-de-France in the Somme department in the north of France. There are still many sculpted and decorated farmhouses from the 19th century, built of stone and brick (which are no longer in use today). Several of these farms had arched gateways. That helped avoid damage from incoming carriages. Category:Communes in Somme",
