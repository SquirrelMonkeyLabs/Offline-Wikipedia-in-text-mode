 "text": "The margin of error is a way to measure the sampling error in the results of a statistical survey. A bigger margin of error means that the results are less certain. Margins of error occur when a population is incompletely sampled. Usually, the margin of error is defined as the radius (half the width) of a confidence interval for a given sample.
