 "text": "María de los Ángeles Becerra (Born, February 12, 2000), known as María Becerra, is an Argentine singer, songwriter and former YouTuber. ==Biography== María de los Ángeles Becerra was born on February 12, 2000, in the city of Quilmes, located in the southern area of Greater Buenos Aires (Argentina). She was the third daughter of Pedro Becerra and Irene Aletti, who met while working as a cardiologist and nurse at the Italian Hospital in La Plata. She has two older brothers, Juan and Geraldine, and a younger sister, Aylín. She has Chilean ancestry and, more distantly, Mapuche ancestry; her paternal great-grandmother came from Chile, and moved to Luis Beltrán (Río Negro) in 1960. From a young age she felt an interest in acting, singing and painting, so at the age of seven she began taking singing, musical comedy, dance and body expression classes at the Valeria Lynch academy. She also combined her classes with soccer practices, another of her passions. She played in a pasture near her home called \"Viejobueno.\" Raised Catholic, she attended a Catholic school from a young age. Later, she convinced her parents to transfer to a technical school, a school focused on trades, to learn carpentry. Becerra mentioned suffering from attention deficit disorder, which made it harder for her to study. She stated in an interview: \"I had a hard time at school, but those of us who have these issues are often treated like idiots, like we don't pay attention, like we don't take things seriously. They called my mom out all the time about this, when in reality I was really trying hard, and it was incredibly frustrating not being able to focus.\" ==Musical career== Becerra left YouTube at nineteen, in the latter half of the year, to focus on her musical career. She debuted as a singer in September of that year, with the release of her first EP, 222, which featured elements of urban pop with brief passages of hip hop. The extended play consisted of three original songs: \"Tu Lady,\" \"Nada de Amor,\" and \"Dime Cómo Hace.\" The latter managed to debut on the Billboard Argentina Hot 100 chart, marking her first entry on the chart. Later, in November of that year, she released her first single, \"High,\" along with its music video. During the first half of 2020, she continued to release several songs, although they received less attention. ==Filmography== Film roles Year Title Role Notes 2024 Despicable Me 4 Poppy Prescott Voice role; Spanish-language dub Stage roles Year Title Role Location 2017 Original, Laboratorio de Clones Herself National tour of Argentina ==References== Category:Living people Category:2000 births Category:Argentine singer- songwriters Category:YouTubers",
