 "text": "San Nicolas is one of the sixteen districts in the city of Manila, Philippines, located at the west central part of the city, on the northern bank of the Pasig River. Considered as a heritage district of Manila, San Nicolas has preserved many of its 19th-century ancestral houses that depict the affluent lives of the people who used to live there. == Origins == The town of San Nicolas was originally named Baybay, meaning \"shore\" in Tagalog. During Spanish rule, Baybay was renamed to San Nicolas, after the patron saint of sailors, boatmen, and mariners. In 1901, during the American Occupation of the Philippines, San Nicolas became a district of the newly chartered city of Manila as its borders were extended outside the walled city presently known as Intramuros. Daniel Burnham, an American architect and urban planner, was commissioned to build a Plan of Manila. The result of the plan was the making of places and parishes that included San Nicolas. ==References== Category:Settlements in Manila Category:Districts of Manila",
