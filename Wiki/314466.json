 "text": "Generalized anxiety disorder (also known as GAD) is an anxiety disorder which consists of excessive and irrational worry of everyday things. This worry tends to interfere with normal daily functioning. GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxiety about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than 1 specific event. People with GAD might always concerned about health matters, money, death, their own futures or family trouble. Some people find it hard to control these worries. Between six and eight million American adults have GAD. The percentage of people that are affected by other anxiety disorders overall is much higher. It affects women more often than it does men, most commonly between ages 35 - 55. == Symptoms == GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. Signs and symptoms include shaking, muscle tension, sweating or hot flushes, dizziness, or heart palpitations, trouble concentrating or getting to sleep for at least six months. == Cause and treatment == Approximately 2.7% of Americans experience this type of anxiety. The cause is unknown in many cases but is often a result of alcohol abuse or suffering from a long term medical condition. Therapy is a good way to help someone beat GAD and other mental conditions like PTSD, which may be causing anxiety. In other cases, or while seeing a therapist, antidepressants (such as SSRIs) help when used long-term. Medications could have side effects and often take a while before they start working. == References == Category:Anxiety disorders",
