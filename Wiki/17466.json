 "text": "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American former professional bodybuilder, actor, film producer, screenwriter, and director. He was the governor of the American state of California from 2003 to 2011. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California. After serving in the army, Schwarzenegger moved to Munich, where he often slept in a gym because he did not have anywhere else to live. Schwarzenegger then moved to the United States in 1968 and eventually became an actor. He has been in several big budget Hollywood movies including The Terminator series. He eventually stopped acting in order to run for governor of California in 2003. In 2003, Governor Gray Davis was removed as governor and Schwarzenegger was elected. His term ended in early January 2011, and he was replaced by Jerry Brown. Before becoming an actor, Schwarzenegger was also a bodybuilder and had won both the Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe titles over 7 consecutive times. Schwarzenegger has also set up his own official competition, Arnold Classic. In 1971, Schwarzenegger's younger maternal half-brother Meinhard died in a car accident due to driving while drunk. In 1986, Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, but they separated and divorced in 2021. They have 2 daughters, Katherine and Christina, and also 2 sons, Patrick and Christopher. Schwarzenegger also has a son with another woman. Some people think that Arnold had cheated on his wife but, such statements have not been proven. In 2013, Schwarzenegger returned to acting with a role in the movie Escape Plan. == Film == Year Title Role Notes 1970 Hercules in New York Hercules Credited as Arnold Strong \"Mr. Universe\" 1973 The Long Goodbye Hood in Augustine's Office Uncredited cameo 1976 Stay Hungry Joe Santo 1979 The Villain \"Handsome Stranger\" 1979 Scavenger Hunt Lars Cameo 1982 Conan the Barbarian Conan the Barbarian 1984 Conan the Destroyer Conan the Destroyer 1984 The Terminator Terminator 1985 Red Sonja Lord Kalidor 1985 Commando Colonel John Matrix 1986 Raw Deal Sheriff Mark Kaminsky / Joseph P.
