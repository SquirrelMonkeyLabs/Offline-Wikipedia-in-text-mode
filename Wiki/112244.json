 "text": "The Calder Memorial Trophy is a yearly award given \"to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition in the National Hockey League.\" The award has been awarded 70 times since its beginnings in 1937. The voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association at the conclusion of each regular season to determine the winner. == History == The trophy is named in honor of Frank Calder, the former President of the National Hockey League from its inception in 1917 to his death in 1943. Although Rookie Of The Year honors were handed out beginning in 1932–33, the Calder Trophy was first presented at the conclusion of the 1936-37 NHL season. After Calder's death in 1942 the trophy was renamed the Calder Memorial Trophy. In 1990, Sergei Makarov of the Calgary Flames became the oldest player, at age 31, to win the Calder, even though he had played professionally in the Soviet Union as a member of HC CSKA Moscow. After that season, the rules for awarding the Calder were amended so that players could only be eligible if they were 26 years old or younger by September 15 of their rookie season. To be eligible for the award, a player cannot have played any more than 25 games previously in any single season, nor have played in more than six games in two separate preceding seasons in any major professional league. The latter fact was perhaps most prominent when in 1979–80, first-year phenom Wayne Gretzky was not eligible to win the Calder Trophy despite scoring 137 points (the previous rookie record at the time being 95), due to him playing a full season the previous year in the World Hockey Association. The trophy has been won the most times by rookies from the Toronto Maple Leafs, who have won it on nine occasions. The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. ==Winners == Positions key C Centre LW Left Wing D Defence RW Right Wing G Goaltender Calder Memorial Trophy winners Season Winner Team Position Age 1932-33 Detroit Red Wings C 25 1933–34 Montreal Maroons C 25 1934–35 New York Americans LW 22 1935–36 Chicago Black Hawks G 23 1936–37 Toronto Maple Leafs C 21 1937–38 Chicago Black Hawks C 24 1938–39 Boston Bruins G 24 1939–40 New York Rangers LW 25 1940–41 Montreal Canadiens C 19 1941–42 New York Rangers RW 19 1942–43 Toronto Maple Leafs RW 19 1943–44 Toronto Maple Leafs C 20 1944–45 Toronto Maple Leafs G 25 1945–46 New York Rangers C 25 1946–47 Toronto Maple Leafs RW 21 1947–48 Detroit Red Wings C 27 1948–49 New York Rangers RW 22 1949–50 Boston Bruins G 24 1950–51 Detroit Red Wings G 20 1951–52 Montreal Canadiens RW 20 1952–53 New York Rangers G 23 1953–54 New York Rangers C 20 1954–55 Chicago Black Hawks RW 22 1955–56 Detroit Red Wings G 23 1956–57 Boston Bruins RW 26 1957–58 Toronto Maple Leafs LW 19 1958–59 Montreal Canadiens C 20 1959–60 Chicago Black Hawks C 23 1960–61 Toronto Maple Leafs C 20 1961–62 Montreal Canadiens RW 21 1962–63 Toronto Maple Leafs D 26 1963–64 Montreal Canadiens D 21 1964–65 Detroit Red Wings G 22 1965–66 Toronto Maple Leafs LW 20 1966–67 Boston Bruins D 18 1967–68 Boston Bruins C 21 1968–69 Minnesota North Stars RW 23 1969–70 Chicago Black Hawks G 26 1970–71 Buffalo Sabres C 19 1971–72 Montreal Canadiens G 24 1972–73 New York Rangers LW 21 1973–74 New York Islanders D 19 1974–75 Atlanta Flames LW 20 1975–76 New York Islanders C 19 1976–77 Atlanta Flames RW 21 1977–78 New York Islanders RW 20 1978–79 Minnesota North Stars C 20 1979–80 Boston Bruins D 19 1980–81 Quebec Nordiques C 24 1981–82 Winnipeg Jets C 18 1982–83 Chicago Black Hawks RW 21 1983–84 Buffalo Sabres G 18 1984–85 Pittsburgh Penguins C 19 1985–86 Calgary Flames D 21 1986–87 Los Angeles Kings LW 20 1987–88 Calgary Flames C 21 1988–89 New York Rangers D 20 1989–90 Calgary Flames RW 31 1990–91 Chicago Blackhawks G 25 1991–92 Vancouver Canucks RW 20 1992–93 Winnipeg Jets RW 22 1993–94 New Jersey Devils G 21 1994–95 Quebec Nordiques C 21 1995–96 Ottawa Senators RW 22 1996–97 New York Islanders D 19 1997–98 Boston Bruins LW 19 1998–99 Colorado Avalanche C 22 1999–2000 New Jersey Devils C 19 2000–01 San Jose Sharks G 25 2001–02 Atlanta Thrashers RW 20 2002–03 St. Louis Blues D 21 2003–04 Boston Bruins G 23 2004–05 2005–06 Washington Capitals LW 20 2006–07 Pittsburgh Penguins C 20 2007–08 Chicago Blackhawks RW 19 2008–09 Columbus Blue Jackets G 21 2009–10 Buffalo Sabres D 20 2010–11 Carolina Hurricanes C 19 2011–12 Colorado Avalanche LW 19 2012–13 Florida Panthers LW 19 2013–14 Colorado Avalanche C 18 2014–15 Florida Panthers D 19 2015–16 Chicago Blackhawks LW 24 2016–17 Toronto Maple Leafs C 19 2017–18 New York Islanders C 21 2018–19 Elias Pettersson Vancouver Canucks C 20 2019–20 Colorado Avalanche D 21 2020–21 Minnesota Wild LW 24 2021–22 Detroit Red Wings D 21 2022–23 Seattle Kraken C 20 2023–24 Chicago Blackhawks C 18 ==Related pages== *List of NHL players *List of NHL statistical leaders ==References== ;General *Calder Trophy history at NHL.com *Calder Trophy profile at Legends of Hockey.net ;Specific Category:National Hockey League trophies and awards",
