 "text": "Angels and Airwaves (AvA) is an American alternative rock band. It was formed by Blink-182 singer and guitarist, Thomas DeLonge. The bandâ€™s current active lineup as a core trio, consists of Delonge, drummer and bassist Ilan Rubin and guitarist David Kennedy. DeLonge created the band angels and airwaves to bring good music to people ears. The band performed amazing live performances and was well liked by Delonge's fans. Most of the songs have long built up intros with guitars, synthesizer, drums and keyboards. Delonge showed over time that his live voice had improved since his time singing for Blink 182. Angels and Airwaves released their first album, We Don't Need To Whisper in 2005. The second studio album, I-Empire was released in October 2007. It was a more lighthearted album with a faster beat. AvA has toured very much. They have said that they will be playing for the second year in a row at Vans Warped tour. They will be playing the entire tour. Seven years after The Dream Walker (2014), Angels and Airwaves released their 6th album, Lifeforms. DeLonge has covered a few songs from Blink 182 but he has never played the full song in respect to his former band mates. He has played slowed versions of \"Down\", \"I Miss You\", \"Not Now\", and \"Reckless Abandon\". He only plays these songs by himself with his guitar. == Discography == * We Don't Need to Whisper (2006) * I-Empire (2007) * Love (2010) * Love: Part Two (2011) * The Dream Walker (2014) * Lifeforms (2021) Category:2005 establishments in California Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American alternative rock bands Category:Musical groups from San Diego Category:Musical groups established in 2005",
