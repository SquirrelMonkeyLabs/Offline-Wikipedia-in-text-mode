Each episode begins with a pre-credits sequence showing the events leading up to a murder and often the discovery of the body afterwards; this sequence also serves to introduce that particular episode's guest characters. The police force of Saint Marie is subsequently informed of the murder, preliminary investigations and interviews take place to establish the suspects, and photographs of the suspects and crime scene are placed on the whiteboard at police headquarters. == International version == Title First episode Last episode Starring Death in Paradise 25 October 2011 Present Beyond Paradise 24 February 2023 Present Return to Paradise TBC UPCOMING Category:Reality television series",
