 "text": "An ideal gas is a gas with particular characteristics. * The particles have no volume * All collisions between particles are elastic collisions and lose no kinetic energy * The particles neither attract each other nor repel * They have random movement Ideal gases are hypothetical which means that they do not exist in their true form. ==Equation== The Ideal gas law that relates the volume, pressure, temperature and number of particles in an ideal gas is: PV=nRT Where: * n = number of moles of gas * T = temperature in Kelvin (K) * R = 8.314 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1, which is the universal gas constant * V = volume in Cubic metre (m3) * P = pressure in Pascals (Pa) Category:Chemistry Category:Gases",
