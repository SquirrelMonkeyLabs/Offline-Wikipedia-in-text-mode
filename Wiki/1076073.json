 "text": "On 12 January 2024, Iranian-backed Houthis launched a ballistic missile towards the Panama-flagged oil tanker M/T Khalissa, which was carrying oil towards the Russian port of Ust-Luga. The missile missed the tanker, hitting the water about away. This event was potentially a case of mistaken identity, as Houthi was retaliating for the devastating attacks in Yemen by the United States and United Kingdom. The ship was previously owned by a company based in the United Kingdom, but it is now owned by a Russian company. The Institute for the Study of War, however, stated Houthi was “targeting” the Russian oil tanker. == Related pages == * List of military operations during 2024 * 6 January 2024 attack on the USS Laboon * 9 January 2024 Houthi attacks * 2024 missile strikes against Yemen ==Notes== ==References== Category:Battles involving Russia Category:Houthi Movement Category:January 2024 events Category:Red Sea crisis",
