All three join a student-led ant-government rebellion. The movie was controversial in the United States for depictions of sexual content. Due to this, The Dreamers was rated NC-17. The movie was released in 2004 in the United States. The movie also exists under an R rated edited version, alongside the NC-17 version. ==Sources== == Other websites == * Category:2003 romantic drama movies Category:British romantic drama movies Category:2000s English-language movies Category:French drama movies Category:French-language movies Category:French romance movies Category:Incest in movies Category:Italian drama movies Category:Italian romance movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies set in Paris Category:Movies set in the 1960s Category:NC-17 rated movies Category:Movies directed by Bernardo Bertolucci",
