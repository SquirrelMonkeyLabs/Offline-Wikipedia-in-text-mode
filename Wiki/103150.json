 "text": "Salam (, ), sometimes spelled salaam, is an Arabic word that literally means \"peace\", but is also used as a general greeting, above all in Arab countries and by Muslim countries around the world in general. The word is also borrowed from Arabic in the Pashto, Persian, and Urdu languages. As-salamu ʿalaykum () is a greeting in Arabic that means \"peace be upon you\". The greeting is a standard salutation among Muslims, whether socially or within worship and other contexts. The typical response to the greeting is wa-ʿalaykumu as-salām (وَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَامُ; \"and upon you be peace\"). The full version of the greeting is as-salamu ʿalaykum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh (, \"peace be upon you, as well as the mercy of God and His blessings\"), with the full response being wa-ʿalaykum as-salam wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh (). It is also preferred to use the greeting when arriving and also while leaving. It was reported that Abu Hurairah said \"When one of you joins a gathering, let him say 'Peace'. When he wants to get up and leave, let him say 'Peace'. The former is not more important than the latter.\"Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2706 * According to hadith, Prophet Muhammad was asked who should begin the greeting and he said, \"The one who is riding should greet the one who is walking and the one who is walking should greet the one who is sitting and the smaller group should greet the larger group.\"Sahih al-Bukhari 6234 Sahih Muslim 2160 * It is also stated that one should give the Salam greeting upon entering a house. This is based upon a verse of the Quran: \"But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from God blessed and good.\"Qur'an 24:61 * Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as A.S., As'kum (in Malaysia), or AsA is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using messaging services such as Snapchat. This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of ṣallá l-Lāhi ʿalayhi wa s-salām. However, this trend is considered improper by the majority of scholars and does not give the same blessings as saying it properly. In addition, As-Salam is one of the 99 Names of God. The Arabic salam means \"Peace\", which is similar to the Hebrew shalom and the Amharic selam. == Related pages == * Shalom, the Hebrew version of Salam * Shalom Aleichem, the Hebrew version of Salam Alaykum == References == Category:Arabic words and phrases",
