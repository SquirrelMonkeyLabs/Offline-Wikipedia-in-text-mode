 "text": "Bismuth(V) fluoride, also known as bismuth pentafluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BiF5. It has five bismuth-fluorine bonds in it. The bismuth is in its +5 oxidation state. ==Properties== Bismuth(V) fluoride is a white crystalline solid. It is an extremely strong oxidizing agent and fluorinating agent, something that adds fluoride ions to other chemicals. It reacts with water to make ozone and oxygen difluoride. It also reacts with iodine and sulfur at room temperature. Above 50°C, it reacts with hydrocarbons like paraffin to make fluorocarbons. At 180°C, it reacts with chlorine to make chlorine monofluoride and with bromine to make bromine trifluoride. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting bismuth(III) fluoride with fluorine at a high temperature. It is also made by reacting bismuth(III) fluoride with chlorine trifluoride. ==Uses== It is used as a fluorinating agent. ==Related pages== *Bismuth(V) oxide *Bismuth(III) chloride *Bismuth(III) oxide Category:Bismuth compounds Category:Fluorine compounds",
