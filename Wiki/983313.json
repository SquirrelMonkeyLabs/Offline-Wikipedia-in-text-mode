 "text": "Angel Recording Studios was a recording and mixing complex in Islington, London. The studios were built by library music specialists de Wolfe Music. Housed in a former United Reform Church, the complex has three dedicated recording areas, one of which incorporates original Victorian choir stalls and features a magnificent Speechley pipe organ dating from 1888. Angel Recording Studios has played host to a variety of international and award-winning music creators, world-famous orchestras, television and film score composers, advertising jingle writers, West End musicals and numerous chart-topping pop acts. Angel Recording Studios closed in December 2019. ==History== ===The Building=== The studios opened as the Islington Chapel in 1887-1888, replacing an earlier chapel built in 1815. It is Grade II listed and features a wealth of original features. The chapel organ made by H.Speechly and Sons remains in situ and working. ===Conversion=== The chapel closed its doors in 1979 and the building was purchased by de Wolfe Music. A major refurbishment and conversion project took place, and recording began in 1982. By 1983, Angel was already attracting acts such as The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees, who leased the studio commercially. After opening a third studio in the complex in 1987, the facilities were upgraded again in 1994. ==References== Category:London Borough of Islington Category:1888 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2019 disestablishments",
