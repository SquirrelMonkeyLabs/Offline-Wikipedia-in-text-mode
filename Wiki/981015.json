 "text": "Löwensenf GmbH is a food company in Düsseldorf owned by Develey Senf & Feinkost. The founding of the company goes back to Otto and Frieda Frenzel, who founded the first Lorraine vinegar and mustard factory in Metz in 1903. After the First World War, residents with German citizenship had to leave Lorraine and the Frenzels built a new plant in Düsseldorf. In 1920 the Löwensenf Extra was launched, which is made using the Dijon process and is the company's best-known product. The name of this brand, which was later transferred to the company, refers to the Bergischer lion in Düsseldorf's coat of arms. As an innovation, the company filled the mustard under vacuum in jars instead of in earthenware pots. In addition to various classic types of mustard, specialties such as old beer mustard, fig mustard and other variations are also offered today. The product range is supplemented by mustard creams, which are used to flavor roulades and meatballs. == References == Category:1903 establishments in Germany Category:Food companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Düsseldorf",
