 "text": "Fruit preserves is the name of specially prepared fruit, where sugar, and sometimes acid, is used to make the fruit last longer. They are often used as a spread. Sugar is used to preserve sweet fruits, but vinegar is used for savoury items. Fruit preserves have been used for a long time, since before refrigeration, to make food last longer. Common examples of fruit preserves are jams, jellies, and marmalade. == How to make preserves == There are many ways to make fruit preserves. Normally, chopped fruit is boiled with sugar and water. After the mixture gets hot enough, it will become firm after it cools down. The preserves are poured into glass jars when they are still hot. After they cool down, a vacuum forms in the jar. This keeps the food fresh for a long time. Category:Food preservation",
