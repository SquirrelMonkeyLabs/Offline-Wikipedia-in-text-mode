He is the leader of a hooligan firm known as the ICC (Inter City Crew). His wife disapproves of his activities as a football hooligan. These contrast to his respectable job as an estate agent. He is unwilling to give up violence as it gives him a \"buzz\". Bexy's father accepts his son's lifestyle. He takes a group photograph of the 'tooled up' gang. He boasts that he did similar activities when younger. He feels that Bex has gone soft because they now use weapons. The film begins with a rival gang called \"The Buccaneers\" vandalising Bexy's Ford Sierra XR4x4. While Bexy is playing football, they spray graffiti in the dressing room. Yeti, the leader of the Bucaneeers drives a white Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet across the football pitch. Bexy wants to form a 'National Firm' made up from rival gangs. He wants this 'firm' to be big enough to take on the large international hooligan groups. Bexy meets leaders from other firms in the Tower Hotel in London. This includes the Buccaneers. The other gangs like the idea. They do not like the idea of Bexy being top boy. The rival firms agree to fight each other to decide who will lead the new firm into Europe. Bexy uses intimidation to keep his position as leader of the ICC. The young men think of themselves as respected figures in their local community. Bexy's wife tells him that is not correct. She says everyone thinks of him as a joke. She says they fear his violent nature, so few are willing to stand up to him. The ICC survive violent clashes with the other gangs. They must still defeat the Buccaneers. Bexy is looking forward to defeating Yeti. Bexy beats up Yeti during the ICC's clash with the Buccaneers. He is shot dead by an injured Yeti. The closing scene depicts the surviving ICC members in a pub. They honour Bexy as a hero. They will fight the European firms in memory of their dead leader. The hooligans agree that Bex was a visionary who brought them together. They give him legendary status. They vow to continue. ==Cast== *Gary Oldman as Clive \"Bex\" Bissell *Lesley Manville as Sue Bissell * Albert Bentall as Sammy Bissell *Phil Davis as \"Yeti\" *Andrew Wilde as \"Oboe\" *Charles Lawson as \"Trigg\" *William Vanderpuye as \"Aitch\" *Jay Simpson as Dominic *Patrick Murray as \"Nunk\" *Robbie Gee as \"Snowy\" *Terry Sue-Patt as Yusef *Nick Dunning as Simon *Nicholas Hewetson as \"Beef\" *Steve McFadden as Billy *Steve Sweeney as JT *Hepburn Graham as Stu ==Reception and legacy== The Firm proved controversial.Ralske, Josh.
