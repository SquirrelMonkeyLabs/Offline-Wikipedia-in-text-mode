 "text": "La La Land is a 2016 American romantic musical comedy-drama movie. Its title is a reference to the nickname for the city of Los Angeles. It is also an idiom for being out of touch with reality. ==Plot== On a crowded Los Angeles highway, an aspiring actress named Mia is distracted by her preparation for an upcoming audition. That leads to a moment of road rage between her and a pianist named Sebastian. Her audition is yet another failure. At the same time, Sebastian is having a problem paying his bills. This leads to an argument with his sister, Laura. Mia's car is towed. She has to walk back to her apartment. Sebastian is told by the owner of a restaurant not to play any jazz. Instead, he plays simple variations of Christmas songs. But he begins a heartfelt improvisation at the restaurant. Mia overhears Sebastian playing. She is moved by his talent, and goes to watch him play. Sebastian, however, is quickly fired. Months later, Mia goes to another party. She sees Sebastian again. He is now playing as the keyboardist for a 1980s pop music cover band. Mia requests that the band play \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" by A Flock of Seagulls.
