 "text": "A foldable phone (also known as a foldable smartphone) is a smartphone that can be folded. Some foldable phones use multiple touchscreen panels on a hinge, while others use a flexible display. Concepts of such devices date back as early as Nokia's \"Morph\" concept in 2008, and a concept presented by Samsung in 2013 (as part of a larger set of concepts using flexible OLED displays). The first commercially available folding smartphones with OLED displays were sold in November 2018. ==Photos== File:Foldable Smartphones.jpg File:Foldable Phones.jpg File:Android Foldable Phones.jpg File:Android Foldable Smartphone.jpg File:Samsung Foldable Phones.jpg File:Samsung Foldable Smartphone.jpg File:Foldable Phone with Stylus.jpg File:Samsung Galaxy Z with S Pen.jpg File:Foldable phones.jpg File:Foldable smartphones.jpg Category:Smartphones",
