 "text": "The Tamam Shud case, also known as the Mystery of the Somerton Man, is an unsolved case of an unidentified man found dead at 6:30 am, 1 December 1948, on Somerton beach, Glenelg, just south of Adelaide, South Australia.The Advertiser, \"Tamam Shud\", 10 June 1949, p. 2 It is named after the Persian phrase tam치m shud, meaning \"ended\" or \"finished\", printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the fob pocket of the man's trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, authored by 12th-century poet Omar Khayy치m. Tamam was misspelt as Taman in many early reports and this error.While the words that end The Rubaiyat are \"Tam치m Shud\" (), it has often been referred to as \"Taman Shud\" in the media, because of a spelling error in early newspaper coverage or police reports which has persisted. In Persian, tam치m is a noun that means \"the end\" and shud is an auxiliary verb indicating past tense, so tamam shud means \"ended\" or \"finished\". Jessica Thomson living in nearby Glenelg was questioned in connection with the case, her phone number was found in the book.The Advertiser, \"Police Test Book For Somerton Body Clue\", 26 July 1949, p. 3 Shortly afterwards, she gave birth to a boy with the same rare ear trait as the unidentified man.Stateline South Australia, \"Somerton Beach Mystery Man\", Transcript, Broadcast 27 March 2009. .
