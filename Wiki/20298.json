 "text": "A Maß or Mass is an old unit of measurement of liquid. Literally translated, it means mass. It is equal to 1.069 litre. Today, it is only used for measuring quantities of beer (one litre). Beer is usually served as 0.2 or 0.3 l (small beer) or as 0.5 l (big beer), but at some occasions (like the Oktoberfest) and some places it is also served as a Maß. Usually this Maß is served in special mugs. These used to be made of ceramics, especially clay. During the 19th and 20th centuries most were replaced by ones made of glass.
