 "text": "A glazed tile is a tile with glaze. It is made by putting chemical glazes on the tile, let it dry, and putting it into a kiln (an oven that heats up to high temperatures). The kiln heats to about 2000 degrees turning the chemical glaze to colors. It is often framed and sold. This is a popular form of art. Glazed tiles were used to make the roof on buildings in China.
