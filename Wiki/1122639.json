 "text": "Split Enz were a New Zealand band formed in 1972. They are considered the first New Zealand band to gain significant recognition outside of Australasia. At first, they were known for their progressive/art rock sound, flamboyant visual style and theatrical performances. The band later moved toward a pop/new wave sound that yielded the breakthrough hit single \"I Got You\" (1980). Split Enz broke up in 1984. Since that time, the band has had several brief reunions.
