This region was created by Nazi Germany in 1939 and declared semi-autonomous with local civil and military administration. The local authorities were staffed with Germans faithful to National Socialism. The German Invasion of Poland (1939) on September 1 triggered World War II. Germany conquered Poland in just 18 days. In September 18, the Soviet Union, signatory party of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, also invaded Poland. Thus, Poland was divided into three main parts: * The western part who was annexed directly in the Greater German Reich as Gau Wartheland. * The eastern part was annexed by the Soviet Union. Unlike the territory taken by Germany, much of the occupied Polish territory remained in the Soviet Union after the war. * The central part remained occupied by Germany. Hitler's decree of October 12, 1939,Axis History Forum created the General Government.Yad Vashem (pdf) At first, General Government was composed of four voivodeships of Poland: Warsaw, Radom, Lublin and Kraków.
