 "text": "Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr., ONH (17 August 1887 â€“ 10 June 1940), was a Jamaican political activist leader. He started the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. He inspired Rastafarians and the Nation of Islam. Garvey was a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist. His ideas came to be known as Garveyism. Garvey was born in Jamaica. He left Jamaica in 1910. He lived in Costa Rica for a few months. In 1912 he moved back to Jamaica. The Marcus Garvey Award is given each year to a Jamaican by JAM. He was an important activist during the Back-to-Africa movement. Garvey was controversial because he supported the separation of black and white people and even supported the Ku Klux Klan. He thanked white people for Jim Crow laws as well. Garvey had a stroke in January 1940 and this caused many to believe he had died. In fact, many early obituaries of Garvey were released, some of which Garvey read himself. He died in London on June 10, 1940 shortly after reading another early obituary of him, aged 52. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Fraudsters Category:Jamaican activists Category:Journalists Category:Political activists Category:Jamaican writers",
