 "text": "Commuting is the act of travelling from home to a workplace every day. A commuter is a person who commutes. This was uncommon until the 19th century, when the word was invented for people who used public transport daily. For many commuters, home is a suburb and work is in the inner city; but the reverse is sometimes the case and is called a reverse commute. Commuters may use other transport, such as cars or bicycles. == References == == Other websites == *US Commuting Averages (2002) *Some Commuters are travelling from France to London *Platform 11 - Ireland's National Rail Commuter Group Category:Transport Category:Employment",
