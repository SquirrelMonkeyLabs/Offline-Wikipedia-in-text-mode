They were most common the Mughal era and the British Raj. Their role in Indian society shrank over time because of changes in society and decreased popularity. == Historical context == Starting in medieval India, women from a lot of different backgrounds were trained to be Tawaifs. Noble families also sent women to show culture. Over time, these women became professional entertainers and companions. == Cultural significance == Tawaifs played multiple roles in Indian society. They were good at music, dancing, poetry, and conversation. They were important to the region's art and culture. Their performances included traditional Indian music and dance forms such as Kathak, Ghazal, Thumri, and Mujra. == Patronage and lifestyle == Tawaifs were paid by rich and important people. These included kings, nobles, and successful merchants. They lived in fancy surroundings and were often provided with a lot of money. The money helped them keep their expensive life and do their work. Tawaifs were also known for their manners and fashion. == Decline and contemporary status == The Tawaif tradition became less important in the late colonial period. Fewer people were interested, and society was changing. The tradition faced more rejection in independent India. There were anti-nautch (anti-dance) laws. People thought of Tawaifs as bad. Now Tawaifs are rare, but their effects in culture continue. Category:History of India Category:Indian culture",
