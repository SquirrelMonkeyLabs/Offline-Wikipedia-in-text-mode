Textiles and clothing, meat, beer, shoes, and ceramics are the major industrial products of the city. == History == Asmara grew from four villages founded in the twelfth century. It is said that there were four clans living in the Asmara area. The women of these tribes told them men to join together to fight bandits who had been attacking the area. After they defeated the bandits, a new name was given to the place, Arbaete Asmara. This name, in the Tigrinya language, meant the four females united. Arbaete was later dropped and the name was made Asmara. In 1889, Asmara became an Italian colony. It was made the capital of the country in 1897 and was called Asmara italiana. The city was damaged during earthquakes in 1913 and 1915. During the 1930s, the Italians made many chances to how Asmara looked. Many new buildings were created during this time and the city was mainly populated by Italian colonists (in 1940 there were 57000 Italian residents on a total population of 98000).Asmara colonia italiana e oltre (in Italian) These buildings were built in the same style as Italian buildings. This gave Asmara the look of an Italian city. Today many of the buildings and stores in Asmara still have Italian names. During World War II, after the defeat of Italy in Africa, Asmara was under British rule. In 1952, the United Nations placed the country and Asmara under Ethiopian control. In the 1960s, the Eritrean people started fighting for independence from Ethiopia. This bloody war lasted until 1991. Asmara was given back to the Eritrean people on May 24, 1991. In July 2017 Asmara has been declared World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. ==Related pages== * Eritrea * Piccola Roma * Italian Mogadiscio ==References== ==Bibliography== * Francesca Calace.
