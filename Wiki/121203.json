It also forms the northern border of Bannu District. The Soan River flows through many cities like Rawalpindi, Attock, and Jehlum. The river starts near a small village in the foothills of Patriata and Murree. Its origin is the southwestern range of Murree Hills. It provides water to Simblee Dam, which is a reservoir of water for Islamabad. Near Pharwala Fort it cuts through a high mountain range. The place is called Swan Cut, also known as the Soan Cut. No stream can cut such a high mountain. It proves the Swaan was there before the formation of this range. And when the mountain rose through millions of years, the stream continued its path by cutting the rising mountain. Ling Stream, following a relatively long course though Lehtrar and Kahuta falls in the Swaan near Sihala. The Soan (also known as Swan or Swaan) also flows through the Pothwar (or Pothohar) Plateau, situated to the south of Islamabad, between the two rivers of Indus and Jehlum. Islamabad Highway crosses this stream near Sihala where famous bridge Cock Pull is constructed over it. Another famous, Lai stream joins this stream near Swaan Camp. After flowing a long path and creating a big curve, the stream reaches Kalabagh where it falls into the Indus River. Finally, the Indus River flows into the Arabian Sea. This relatively small stream is more than 250 kilometers long. Due to its mountainous course and shallow bed, it is hardly used for irrigation purposes. Fishing is not possible in this stream as a profession. Rohu is the main species of fish in this stream. Kingfisher birds hunt here too.
