 "text": "Jabal al-Nour, also known as the Mountain of Light, is a prominent mountain located near the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. It holds significant religious and historical importance in Islam due to its association with the early life of the Prophet Muhammad. The most notable feature of Jabal al-Nour is the Cave of Hira, situated near its summit. It is within this cave that Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad received the first revelations of the Quran from the Angel Gabriel, marking the beginning of his prophethood. The event is known as the \"First Revelation\" or \"First Wahi.\" Pilgrims and visitors often make the journey to Jabal al-Nour to visit the Cave of Hira, which has become a site of spiritual significance and contemplation for Muslims worldwide. The climb to the cave can be physically demanding, requiring a hike up the mountain, but it is considered a deeply rewarding and spiritually enriching experience for many believers. Jabal al-Nour serves as a reminder of the profound spiritual journey of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of Islam, making it a revered location for Muslims seeking to connect with their faith and history. == References == Category:Geography of Saudi Arabia",
