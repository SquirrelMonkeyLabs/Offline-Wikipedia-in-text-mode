 "text": "The uphill tree frog, long-snouted tree frog, Annandale's high-altitude tree frog, or proboscis frilled tree frog (Kurixalus naso) is a frog. It lives in China, India, and Myanmar. People have seen it between 252 and 1631 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees. Scientists do not think it lives in places that human beings have changed. The frog lays eggs in small pools of water that dry up for part of the year. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that swim. These frogs fight each other over good places to look for food. It only eats a few kinds of food, mostly animals without spines. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms called jhum and to build dams that make electricity. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
