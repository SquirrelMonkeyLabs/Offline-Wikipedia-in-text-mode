 "text": "The Icelandic Phallological Museum () has the world's largest display of penises and penile parts. As of early 2020 the museum moved to a new location in Hafnartorg in Reykjavík, Iceland. The collection holds well over 300 penises from more than 100 species of mammal. The museum also holds 22 penises from creatures and peoples of Icelandic folklore. In July 2011, the museum got its first human penis, however it decomposed quickly. The museum continues to search for \"a younger and a bigger and better one.\" It was founded in 1997 by since-then retired teacher Sigurður Hjartarson. The museum has become a popular tourist attraction with thousands of visitors a year and has received international media attention, including a Canadian documentary movie called The Final Member, which is about the museum's quest to obtain a human penis. ==References== Category:Reykjavík Category:Museums in Europe Category:20th- century establishments in Iceland",
