 "text": "The Free-produce movement was a movement that started as a non-violent way to oppose slavery. The abolitionist movement used it as a non-violent way for individuals, including the disenfranchised, to fight slavery. In this context, free signifies \"not enslaved\" (i.e. \"having the legal and political rights of a citizen\"Merriam Webster Online. Free. Retrieved on April 24, 2009.). It does not mean \"without cost\". Similarly, \"produce\" does not mean just fruits and vegetables, but a wide variety of products made by slaves, including clothing, dry goods, shoes, soaps, ice cream, and candy. == Lack of success == The free produce movement was not a success. Many abandoned it after a few years. Non- slave products were more expensive and sometimes hard to find. At times, it faced high tariffs blocking imports. In some cases the origin of the goods could not be determined. Sometimes the non-slave goods were of poorer quality; one storeowner \"not infrequently received sugar 'with a very disagreeable taste and odor' and rice that was 'very poor, dark and dirty.'\" Benefits to slaves or reduction in demand for slave-produced goods was very small. Many abolitionists ignored the issue altogether.
