 "text": "Legislative elections in France were held on 12 and 19 June 2022 to elect the 577 members of the 16th National Assembly. The elections took place after the 2022 French presidential election, which was held in April. Turnout for the first round was a record low 47.5%. Ensemble, a pro-Emmanuel Macron coalition came in first place. The newly formed socialist environmentalist NUPES coalition led by Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon finished second. In the second round, which had a higher turnout than that of the 2017 French legislative election, Macron's Ensemble coalition won the most seats, 250, in the National Assembly but also lost majority control, causing a hung parliament. NUPES won a large amount of seats, having a total of 151 seats. ==References== Category:June 2022 events Category:2022 in France Category:2022 elections in Europe",
