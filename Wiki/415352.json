 "text": "The Nintendo 2DS is a handheld game console made by Nintendo. It is a new version of Nintendo's Nintendo 3DS console that has a flat design like the Game Boy consoles (instead of the flip design (a design where two or more sections fold by a hinge) of the 3DS), and does not play 3DS games in 3D. It was announced on August 27, 2013. It was released on October 12, 2013 in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. It is aimed at children under the age of seven, whom Nintendo had said should not use the 3D mode on the 3DS due to possible health problems that it could cause. It costs less than the 3DS. In North America, it costs $129.99 (£109.99 in the UK), compared to the $169.99 (£134.99 in the UK) price of the 3DS. The Nintendo 2DS was discontinued in 2019 in Japan and worldwide in 2020. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Nintendo 3DS Category:Nintendo video game consoles",
