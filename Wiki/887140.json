 "text": "Kaffeklubben Island or Coffee Club Island (; ) is an island near the northern tip of Greenland. It is uninhabited, which means no people live there. It has the farthest north point on Earth, or the point closest to the North Pole. == Discovery == American explorer Robert Peary saw Kaffeklubben Island in 1900. This was the first time the island had ever been seen, but Peary did not visit the island. The island was not visited until 1921, when the Danish explorer Lauge Koch visited the island and named it. The island was named after the coffee club in the University of Copenhagen Geological Museum. In 1969, a Canadian team discovered that the northernmost point on the island was farther north than Cape Morris Jesup, the northernmost point on mainland Greenland. Because of this, Kaffeklubben Island has the record for having the farthest north point on land. Since then, many deposits of gravel have been found in the sea to the north of the island, such as Oodaaq, 83-42, and ATOW1996. However, they are not permanent. They are usually absorbed by moving ice sheets, move around because of the tides, or sink into the ocean. == Geography == Kaffeklubben Island is from the North Pole. The island is near Cape James Hill, northwest of Bliss Bay, about east of Cape Morris Jesup. Its farthest north point is 4.4 km north of the farthest north point of Cape Morris Jesup. It is about long, and about across at its widest point. The highest point is about above sea level. == Environment == Not many things can survive on the island. However, some plants grow on Kaffeklubben Island, including mosses, liverworts, lichens, and the flowering plants Saxifraga oppositifolia (purple saxifrage) and Papaver radicatum (arctic poppy). == References == Category:Islands of Denmark Category:Uninhabited islands Category:Geography of Greenland Category:Atlantic islands Category:Islands of North America",
