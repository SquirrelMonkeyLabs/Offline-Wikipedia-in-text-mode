 "text": "The Dubliners were an Irish folk band founded in Dublin in 1962. Their most famous lead singers were Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew. The band was successful with their lively Irish folk songs, traditional street ballads and instrumentals. They were one of the most influential Irish acts of the 20th century. They celebrated 50 years together in 2012, the year they retired. Dominic Behan wrote songs for them including McAlpine's Fusiliers. == History == In 1962, Ronnie Drew, Barney McKenna, Ciaran Bourke and Luke Kelly formed an Irish-folk group in O' Donoghues Pub, Dublin called \"The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group\" but soon renamed to \"The Dubliners\" as Luke Kelly was reading a book of that name by James Joyce. From then on, fiddle-player John Sheahan joined and the original lineup of The Dubliners was formed. In 1962 they recorded a record titled \"The Dubliners\". In 1983, Luke Kelly died of a brain tumour and Sean Cannon replaced him. == Singers == * Ronnie Drew, 1962-1974, 1979-1995, 2002, 2006, Vocals, Guitar * Barney McKenna, 1962-2012, Banjo, Mandolin, Vocals * Luke Kelly, 1962-1983, Vocals, banjo * John Sheahan 1964-2012, Fiddle, Mandolin, Vocals * Bob Lynch, 1964-1965, Vocals, Guitar * Ciaran Bourke, 1962-1974, Guitar, Tin Whistle, Vocals * Jim McCann, 1974-1975, 2002, Vocals, Guitar * Sean Cannon, 1983-2012, Vocals, Guitar * Eamonn Campbell, 1987-2012, Vocals, Guitar * Paddy Reilly, 1995-2006, Vocals Guitar * Patsy Watchorn, 2006-2012, Vocals, banjo ==References== Category:1962 establishments in Europe Category:20th-century establishments in the Republic of Ireland Category:2012 disestablishments in Europe Category:1980s Irish music groups Category:1990s Irish music groups Category:2000s Irish music groups Category:2010s Irish music groups Category:Folk music groups Category:Musical groups from Dublin Category:Musical groups established in 1962 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2012",
