 "text": "Sharon is a city in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, in the United States, northwest of Pittsburgh. It was the home of the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. ==History== The Sharon area was first settled in 1795. It was made into a borough on October 6, 1841. It became a cite on December 17, 1918. The city operated under the Pennsylvania third-class city code until 2008. At that time, it adopted a home rule charter. The elected position of mayor was replaced with a hired city manager and financial officer. The founding families of Sharon first settled on a flat plain bordering the Shenango River. It was between two hills on the southwestern edge of what is today Sharon's downtown business district. Local legend says the community got its name from from the Plain of Sharon in Israel. At first, the economy of Sharon was based on coal mining. It changed to iron and steelmaking and other heavy industry. This happened after the Erie Extension Canal was built in the 1840s. After deindustrialization in the nation in the 1970s and '80s, the city's economy changed again. It is now based on light industry, education, health care, and social services. Before Prohibition in 1919, Sharon was home to a large beer brewery, Union Brewing Co. It was forced to close because of prohibition. Sharon is the home of the original Quaker Steak & Lube. It opened in 1974. The Vocal Group Hall of Fame was created there. Other local attractions are The Winner off-price fashion store, Reyer's shoes, and Daffin's Candy. ==References== Category:Cities in Pennsylvania",
