 "text": "the 2022 eruption of the Tongan seamount, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai was a very powerful volcanic eruption that began in December 2021 and reached its climax in mid-January 2022. the eruption was rated a 5-6 on the volcanic explosivity index and is the most recent VEI 6 eruption so far. The eruption killed 6 people in total and caused a tsunami that reached as far east as Peru, north as Japan, and northeast as the gulf of Alaska. the eruption caused an atmospheric disturbance rivalled by no eruption in recent times except the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa. == timeline of the eruption == the eruption began on the 20th December 2022 when the submarine seamount suddenly began violently sending particulates into the atmosphere followed by a huge ash cloud that was visible from Nukuʻalofa, the capital city of Tonga. this initial eruption ended by 02:00 on 21 December 2022. 8-to-14-kilometre-high (5.0 to 8.7 mi) plumes containing sulfur dioxide drifted to the north-north- east and spread over the Niuatoputapu, Haʻapai and Vavaʻu island groups. The steam and gas emissions reached altitudes of 10.3–12.2 kilometres within 3-6 days of the next stage of the eruption. On 25 December 2022, satellite imagery revealed that the island had increased in size by 300–600 metres (980–1,970 ft) on its eastern side and ash plumes by the end of December had disrupted many airlines to and from Tonga.
