 "text": "A positive-definite matrix is a matrix with special properties. The definition of the term is best understood for square matrices that are symmetrical, also known as Hermitian matrices. == Definition == A square matrix filled with real numbers is positive definite if it can be multiplied by any non-zero vector and its transpose and be greater than zero. The vector chosen must be filled with real numbers. == Examples == *The matrix M_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} is positive definite. To prove this, we choose a vector with entries \\textbf{z}= \\begin{bmatrix} z_0 \\\\\\ z_1\\end{bmatrix}. When we multiply the vector, its transpose, and the matrix, we get: \\begin{bmatrix} z_0 & z_1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} z_0 \\\\\\ z_1\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} z_0\\cdot 1+z_1\\cdot 0 & z_0\\cdot 0+z_1\\cdot 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} z_0 \\\\\\ z_1\\end{bmatrix}=z_0^2+z_1^2; when the entries z0, z1 are real and at least one of them nonzero, this is positive. This proves that the matrix M_0 is positive-definite. Category:Linear algebra de:Definitheit#Definitheit von Matrizen",
