 "text": "Motor racing was contested at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Fourteen events were held in conjunction with 1900 World's Fair. These events have generally not been classified as official, although the IOC has never decided which events were \"Olympic\" and which were not. Entries were by manufacturers rather than drivers, and competitors' names were not adequately reported at the time. The exceptions are the two classes of the Paris-Toulouse-Paris race, one class of which was won by Louis Renault. Most events had only French competitors but there were some international entries. ==Medal summary== Event Gold Silver Bronze 2 seater car – Under 400 kg – 815 km – Race A Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France none 2 seater car – Under 400 kg – 815 km – Race B Unknown driver Car – Renault France Unknown driver Car – Outhenin-Chaldenre France Unknown driver Car – Fernandez France Unknown driver Car – Hanzer France 2 seater car – Over 400 kg Unknown driver Car – Peugeot France Unknown driver Car – Delahaye France Unknown driver Car – Serpollet France Unknown driver Car – Rochet-Petit France 4 seater car – Over 400 kg Unknown driver Car – de Dietrich France Unknown driver Car – Delahaye France Unknown driver Car – Brouhot France Unknown driver Car – Hurtu France 6 seater car – Over 400 kg Unknown driver Car – Panhard-Levassor France Unknown driver Car – Brouhot France Unknown driver Car – Serpollet France Unknown driver Car – Georges Richard France 7 seater car not awarded Unknown driver Car – Panhard-Levassor France none Taxi – Petrol – 300 km Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France Taxi – Electric – 300 km Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France Delivery Van – 500 to 1200 kg – Petrol – 300 km Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France Delivery Van – 500 to 1200 kg – Electric – 300 km Unknown driver Unknown car France Unknown driver Unknown car France none Small Truck – Over 1000 kg – 300 km Unknown driver Car – de Dion-Bouton France Unknown driver Car – Peugeot France none Unknown driver Car – Riker Electric United States Truck Unknown driver Car – de Dion-Bouton (I) France Unknown driver Car – Peugeot France Unknown driver Car – de Dion-Bouton (II) France Unknown driver Car – Panhard-Levassor France none none Fire Truck Gilbert Brown Car – Unknown truck USA none none Paris-Toulouse-Paris – Small Car Louis Renault Car – Renault France Schrader Car – Renault-Aster France Grus Car – Renault France Paris-Toulouse-Paris – Large Car \"Levegh\" (Alfred Velghe) Car – Mors France Pinson Car – Panhard-Levassor France Carl Voight Car – Panhard-Levassor Germany Category:1900 in sports",
