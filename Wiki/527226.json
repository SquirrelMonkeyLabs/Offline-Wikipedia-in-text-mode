 "text": "The Stonewall Inn (or just Stonewall) is a gay and lesbian tavern and recreational bar in New York City that was the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots. The original inn closed that year. In 1990, a bar named \"Stonewall\" opened in the western half of the original location. In June 2015, the Stonewall received an official landmark status from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission for its role as spreding the LGBT movement. It is the first landmark in New York City that has been recognized for its status in LGBT history. ==References== Category:Entertainment venues Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:New York City Designated Landmarks Category:LGBT in the United States",
