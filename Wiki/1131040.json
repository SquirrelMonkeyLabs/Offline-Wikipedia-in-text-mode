 "text": "Harlequin is a legacy name used by several super-villains in the DC Comics universe. They were created by Robert Kanigher and Irwin Hasen, first appearing in All-American Comics #89 (1947). Molly Mayne was the original during the Golden Age, although she retired to marry her adversary Green Lantern. Her ability is to project realistic illusions using her special glasses. Duela Dent used the name to become a hero and member of the Teen Titans. Marcie Cooper took up Mayne's mantle to fight Infinity, Inc. as a member of the Injustice Society. In the modern era a fourth Harlequin with illusion-casting powers appeared to plague Green Lantern as well. Joker's girlfriend Harley Quinn uses a similar alias, making a pun on her own name Harleen Quinzel. Category:DC Comics supervillains",
