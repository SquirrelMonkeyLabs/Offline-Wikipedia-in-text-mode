Scientists saw the frog in exactly one place. Scientists saw the frog 660 meters above sea level. The place where scientists found the frog is inside Canaima National Park. ==Young== Scientists think the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger. Climate change could hurt this frog because it lives high in the tepui flatland and cannot move somewhere colder or wetter if the weather becomes too hot or dry. Its home is big and human beings do not go there much. New diseases could also hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
