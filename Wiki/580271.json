She made many telephone and live guest appearances on his shows: Late Night and Late Show. Following several years of appearing through telephone, Mengering (usually known as \"Dave's Mom\" or \"Dave's Mom Dorothy\", with no mention of her surname) became a recurring on-camera guest on Letterman's subsequent Late Show, initially by covering the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. In 2015, Mengering suffered a stroke, but recovered months later. Mengering died on April 11, 2017 at her home in Carmel, Indiana at the age of 95. She died one day before Letterman's 70th birthday. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Dorothy Mengering being interviewed by her granddaughter,HOW editor Bryn Mooth, for StoryCorps (Reported by Family Tree Magazine (at familytreemagazine.com/insider) * Category:1921 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Disease-related deaths in Indiana Category:American television personalities Category:Entertainers from Indiana",
