It was created by Milton Glaser and Clay Felker in 1968 as a competitor to The New Yorker. Over time, it became more national in scope, publishing many noteworthy articles on American culture by writers such as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Nora Ephron, John Heilemann, Frank Rich, and Rebecca Traister. In 2009, its paid and verified circulation was 408,622, with 95.8% of that coming from subscriptions.
