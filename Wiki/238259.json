 "text": "Sketches by \"Boz,\" Illustrative of Every-day Life and Every-day People (usually known as Sketches by Boz) is a collection of short pieces written by Charles Dickens. The book was published in 1836. The first edition was illustrated by George Cruikshank. ==Publications== The first edition of Sketches by Boz was published by John Macrone in two series. The first series was a two-volume set which was published in February 1836. This was just a month before the publication of the first parts of The Pickwick Papers (1836-37). The \"Second Series\" was published in August 1836. After Dickens became famous, he could buy out his agreements with Macrone. Macrone died unexpectedly at 28. Dickens helped to publish a book called The Pic-Nic Papers to help Macrone's widow and children. ==Contents of the installments== Most of the fifty-six sketches that appear in the 1839 edition were originally published individually in various newspapers and periodicals.
