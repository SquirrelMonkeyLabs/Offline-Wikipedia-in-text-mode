 "text": "\"Don't Wanna Fall in Love\" (also titled \"Don't Want to Fall in Love\") is a 1990 pop and romantic dance song. It peaked at #2 across the Billboard in spring of 1990. A new jack swing remix for the song was released later that year. The single is by Jane Child. This is the only Top 40 charting single from Child. In the United Kingdom, however, it peaked at only #22 due to Child not wanting to appear on a popular British television show for fear of being classified a sellout.
