The song was released on July 25, 2014. There have been many remixes with many different rappers. The song was able to make it to #1 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #16 on the Rhythmic charts. It was also certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Producer Jahlil Beats said that he first made the beat for rapper Meek Mill but he didn't use it because it sounded too close to other songs he was already doing. Jahlil then sent the beat to Lloyd Banks who used it on his song \"Jackpot\". The night that Shmurda went to prison, he played the entire Shmurda She Wrote EP for Jahlil. In the song, Shmurda raps about he grew up selling crack since he was in the 5th grade. He also raps about his father and friends being sent to prison and asking for them to be released. He then raps about how he and his crew kill people. A music video for the song was released. In the video, Bobby and his GS9 crew are smoking joints and hanging out. Bobby raps at the camera and he dances along with his crew. The video was filmed in East Flatbrush, Brooklyn, New York. The song gained popularity on Vine where the lyric \"About a week ago\" became a meme. The dance that Bobby does in the music video became a viral trend called the \"Shmoney dance\" with many people doing it including celebrities like Beyoncé, Justin Bieber and Drake. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2014 songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Internet memes Category:Trap songs",
