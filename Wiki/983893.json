She was a great poet who composed a Legend of Northland which is a very beautiful poem. The sisters co- published poems in 1849, and then each went on to publish volumes of their own. After their deaths in 1871, joint anthologies of the sisters' unpublished poems were also compiled. == Related pages == *List of poets from North America Category:American poets Category:1824 births Category:1871 deaths",
