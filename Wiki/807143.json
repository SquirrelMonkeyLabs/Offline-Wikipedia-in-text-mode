Delphine was born on 23 October 1999 in South Africa, and was raised in Cape Town. She experienced a devout Christian family upbringing. After her parents divorced, she moved to Lymington, England with her mother. Now in Hampshire, she attended Priestlands School, but dropped out at the age of fourteen, due to being bullied online. Around this time, she was treated for depression. After dropping out, she found work as a waitress, nanny, and barista. Delphine also began posting pictures of her cosplay onto her Facebook account, which was later deleted. These now-deleted cosplay posts were \"low- res and dimly lit.\" Delphine has a boyfriend, who often works on the photography of her modeling content and likes to remain anonymous. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cape Town Category:British YouTubers Category:South African models Category:Adult models Category:English models Category:Pornographic actors Category:Pseudonyms Category:White South African people",
