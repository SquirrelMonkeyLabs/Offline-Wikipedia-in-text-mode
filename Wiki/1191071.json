 "text": "At 9:08 p.m. EDT on May 21, 2025, a man reportedly opened fire at the Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., where a Jewish event was held. Two persons named Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were killed. The suspect reportedly shot Milgrim and Lischinsky 21 times at point-blank until his gun jammed or ran out of bullets. Several media critics called the shooting antisemitic, while the FBI said on May 23 that the shooting was an act of targeted antisemitism. ==Victims== ===Sarah Milgrim=== Sarah Milgrim was an American Jew while Yaron Lischinsky was a German-Israeli. The victims had worked for the D.C. Israeli embassy. They reportedly belonged to groups advocating for peace between Israel and Palestine. Milgrim was hired by the Israeli embassy in late 2023. ===Yaron Lischinsky=== Yaron Lischinsky moved from Germany to Israel at 16 years old before starting his job at the D.C. Israeli embassy. The event attended by them was held by the American Jewish Committee (AJC), aimed at discussing \"how multi-faith organizations can work together to bring humanitarian aid to war-torn regions like Gaza\". ==Suspect== The suspect Elias Rodriguez has been charged with murder. * * * * * There are claims that he belonged to the Marxist–Leninist party Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) and joined their events between 2017 and 2018, and made posts on Twitter consisting of the phrases \"zionazi\", \"Death To Israel\" and sharing videos of the former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The posts were made in the months following the October 7 attack – seen by some scholars as the worst massacre of Jews since the end of the Holocaust. * * * * * The PSL said that Rodriguez \"had a brief association with one branch of the PSL that ended in 2017\". ==Aftermath== 42 Jewish organizations requested the U.S. government to address antisemitism in the country. Their request includes: * Prosecution of antisemitic hate crimes and extremist violence * Expansion of FBI intelligence operations and counter-domestic terrorism operations * Funding increase for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to $1 billion from its current level of $274.5 million ==Related pages== * Charlie Hebdo shooting * * * * * * * 2025 Pahalgam Massacre * * * * * Pittsburgh synagogue shooting * * * * April 2017 Champs-Élysées attack * * * ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Antisemitism Category:May 2025 events Category:Political violence Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:Terrorist attacks in the United States Category:Racially-motivated violence in the United States Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures in the United States",
