His academic work spans the fields of climatology, biogeography, geocryology, and paleoclimatology, with research conducted across Asia and North America. He is recognized for his studies on alpine permafrost and the effects of climate change in cold regions. Harris obtained a Bachelor of Science (Honours) and Master of Science in Geology, followed by a PhD and later a Doctor of Science (DSc) in Geography from Queen Mary University of London. Early in his career, he worked in applied geology and engineering, providing geological and hydrological consultancy to the British military in Egypt and Jordan during the 1950s. He later served as a soil surveyor with Hunting Technical Services and the Government of Guyana. He transitioned to academia with teaching appointments at the University of Chicago, Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Kansas. In 1969, Harris joined the University of Calgary, where he remained until his retirement. His research has focused on permafrost processes, climate variability, and alpine environmental systems. Among his publications is the 2017 monograph Geocryology: Characteristics and Use of Frozen Ground and Permafrost Landforms, which has been translated into Russian. ==References==",
