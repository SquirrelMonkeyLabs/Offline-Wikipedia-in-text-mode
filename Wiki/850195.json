 "text": "Boana semilineata is a species of frog native to Brazil. It is commonly known for its semi-lined appearance, with distinct markings that help distinguish it from other frog species in the region. This species is found predominantly in the Atlantic Forest, a biodiverse region along the eastern coast of Brazil. == Habitat and Distribution == Boana semilineata typically inhabits tropical and subtropical rainforests, often found near water sources such as streams, rivers, and wetlands. These frogs are arboreal, meaning they spend a significant amount of time in trees, although they can also be found on the forest floor during breeding seasons. The species is mostly concentrated in the eastern regions of Brazil, particularly in states like Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. == Behavior and Diet == Boana semilineata is primarily nocturnal, becoming active at night when it feeds on a diet of small insects, spiders, and other invertebrates. These frogs are known for their distinctive calls during the mating season, often heard near water bodies where they gather to breed. Their vocalizations are used by males to attract females. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
