 "text": "The First Messenian War was a set of battles between two Greek city states, Sparta and Messenia. It began in 743 BC and ended in 724 BC. These two major powers fought to decide which was the better kingdom in Greece. There were three Messenian Wars. This war was the first of them. Eventually, Sparta would defeat the Messenians. After the Second Messenian War Messenia was conquered and destroyed by the Spartans. In the Third Messenian War, there was no hope of freedom left for the Peloponnese (the people who lived in Messenia before the Spartans). == Beginning == The First Messenian War began as the result of population problems. Spartans were the major threat, and greatest kingdom in Greece. The military was highly trained, and was very good at land battles. But there was one big problem. Sparta had a small population. The kingdom soon found a risky solution. Right beside Sparta, there was a kingdom that had a very large population: Messenia. It had a population of about 8000 to 10,000. So the Spartans wanted the Messenian people. For a start, the ninth king of Sparta, Almenes built a large army. == The war == The First Messenian War started successfully for the Spartans. The city of Ampheia in Messenia was easily taken. While the people living in the city were sleeping, the Spartan army suddenly appeared at the city walls and gates, and massacred the opposition. They took many prisoner. Most of these prisoners were sold as slaves. For the rest of the war, the Spartans invaded, massacred, and took captive. The Messenian army could not do much to defend its country. King Aristodemus of Messenia was troubled about the Spartan expansion in his lands. So he ordered guerrilla warfare to take place. Even this strategy did not stop the Spartans, and after about 20 years of fighting, Messenia gave up the the first round to the Spartans. The Second Messenian War would begin in a matter of years. == Sacrifice and regret == King Aristodemus of Messenia sacrificed his daughter to the god of death for a victory over the Spartans. When Aristodemus realized that he lost the First Messenian War, he deeply regreted the sacrifice. He also felt betrayed by the gods. According to legend, the king killed himself by the grave of his daughter in sadness. == Results == The main contribution of the First Messenian War was that Sparta successfully increased its population, and also made its influence in Ancient Greece greater. == References == Category:Battles of ancient Greece",
