 "text": "The fifteenth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who premiered on 12 April 2025. This series is also known as \"Season Two\" following the production changes and the acquisition of Doctor Whos international broadcasting rights by Disney+ prior to the previous series. It is the sixth series led by Russell T Davies as head writer and executive producer and the second since his return to the show in 2023, having previously worked on it from 2005 to 2010. This series is set to be the fifteenth to air following the programme's revival in 2005, and is the forty- first season overall. This is the second series and last to star Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor, an incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in the TARDIS, which appears to be a British police box from the outside. Varada Sethu joins the series as new companion Belinda Chandra, with Millie Gibson also set to feature as Ruby Sunday, the previous series' companion. The series was preceded by a Christmas episode in December 2024, written by former showrunner and head writer Steven Moffat, where Nicola Coughlan appears as a one-off companion. In late 2024, Ncuti Gatwa announced he would depart from the show after series 15. == Cast == === Main === * Ncuti Gatwa as The Fifteenth Doctor * Millie Gibson as Ruby Sunday * Nicola Coughlan as Joy Almondo * Varada Sethu as Belinda Chandra === Recurring === * Michelle Greenidge as Carla Sunday * Angela Wynter as Cherry Sunday * Jemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart * Bonnie Langsford as Melanie Bush * Lenny Rush as Morris Gibbons * Nicholas Briggs as Voice of the Vlinx * Aidan Cook as The Vlinx * Yasmin Finney as Rose Noble === Guest === *Davina McCall *Bobby Bradley – Denzel *Mary Malone – Trudy *Belinda Owusu – Woman with Pram *Barney Wilkinson – Policeman *Anita Dobson – Mrs Flood *Hemi Yeroham – Abdul *Michelle Greenidge – Carla Sunday *Angela Wynter – Cherry Sunday *Gemma Arrowsmith – Ruth Lyons *Rachelle Beinart, Jess Judge, Dilu Miah, Giuseppe Lentini, Andrew Francis, Lukas Disparrow – Goblins *Susan Twist – Heckler (uncredited) *Golda Rosheuvel – Jocelyn Sancerre *Michelle Greenidge – Carla Sunday *Angela Wynter – Cherry Sunday *Mason McCumskey – Eric *Sami Amber – Voice of Eric *Sienna-Robyn Mavanga-Phipps – Poppy *Shola Olaitan-Ajiboye – Voice of Poppy *Cadence Williams – Voice of Sandra *Param Patel – Voice of Marcel *Lonnee Archibong – Voice of Adjani *Jesus Reyes Ortiz – Rico Trieste *Yasmine Bouabid – Lucia Colasanto *Robert Strange – Bogeyman *Susan Twist – Comms Officer Gina Scalzi (uncredited) *Jinkx Monsoon – Maestro *Jeremy Limb – Timothy Drake *Kit Rakusen – Henry *Sherinne Kayra Anderson – Tea Trolley Lady *Ed White – George Martin *George Caple – Paul McCartney *Chris Mason – John Lennon *Philip Davies – George Harrison *James Hoyles – Ringo Starr *Chan Shoker – Studio Producer *Josie Sedgwick-Davies – Cilla Black *Susan Twist – Tea Lady *Simon Jason-Smith – Vinnie *Laura June Hudson – Elderly Woman *Murray Gold – Himself *Shirley Ballas – Herself *Johannes Radebe – Himself *Joe Anderson – John Francis Vater *Majid Mehdizadeh-Valoujerdy – Carson *Caoilinn Springall – Splice Alison Vater *Varada Sethu – Mundy Flynn *Bhav Joshi – Canterbury James Olliphant *Susan Twist – Ambulance *Hilary Hobson – The Woman *Susan Twist – Hiker *Maxine Evans – Lowri Palin *Siân Phillips – Enid Meadows *Sion Pritchard – Joshua Steele *Gwion Morris Jones – Ifor Jones *Elan Davies – Thin Lucy *Glyn Pritchard – Eddie Jones *Anita Dobson – Mrs Flood *Graham Butler – Frank Hinchey *Ali Ariaie – Sanjay Miah *Albey Brookes – Rufus Bray *Aneurin Barnard – Roger ap Gwilliam *Miles Yekinni – Craig Deloach *Amol Rajan – Himself *Sophie Ablett – Marti Bridges *Shane David- Joseph – Akhim Patil *Jason May – Groundsman *Dylan Baldwin – Security Officer *David Constant – Armed Policeman *Deeviya Meir – Newsreader *Amanda Walker – Old Ruby *Rhyanna Alexander-Davis – Elizabeth Campbell *Vee Vimolmal – Nurse *Paul Forman – Lord Barton *Maxim Ays – Lord Galpin *Indira Varma – Duchess of Pemberton *Jonathan Groff – Rogue *Camilla Aiko – Emily Beckett *Debra Baker – Housekeeper *Ashley Campbell – Butler *Nancy Brabin-Platt – Miss Talbot *David Charles – Mr Price *Susan Twist – Portrait (uncredited) *Richard E.
