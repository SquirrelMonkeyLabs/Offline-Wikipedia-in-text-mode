 "text": "The Basedow Range is a mountain range in the south of the Northern Territory, Australia. It is located on the northern side of the Lasseter Highway, in the section between the Luritja and Stuart Highways. The range consists of two ridges of deformed sedimentary rock. The western ridge makes up most of the range's mass, and is about 12 km long. A small gap separates it from the eastern ridge, which is about 5 km long and much lower in height. The highest peak is Mount Ebenezer (702 m), which is located near the east end of the western ridge. The Basedow Range is about 204 km south of Alice Springs. It is entirely within the property of the Mount Ebenezer cattle station. The community of Imaá¹‰pa is at the base of Mount Ebenezer on its southern side. To the west of the range is the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area. The Basedow Range was named by the explorer W. H. Tietkens when he reached the area on 19 July 1889. He named it after Martin P. F. Basedow, a German politician from Adelaide. ==References== Category:Mountain ranges of Australia Category:Mountains of the Northern Territory",
