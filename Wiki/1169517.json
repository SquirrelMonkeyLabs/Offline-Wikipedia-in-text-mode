 "text": "The collared poison frog (Mannophryne collaris) is a frog. It lives in the Andes Mountains in MÃ©rida, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams in forests on mountains. Scientists saw the frog between 224 and 1763 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People change the forests where it lives to make towns and other things for humans. It is also hotter than it used to be and there is less rain. Scientists checked the frogs for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, but they do not know if the disease chytridiomycosis has killed many of them or not. ==Help== Scientists are keeping some of these frogs at Chorros de Milla Zoo in Merida City so they will still be there even if the wild frogs all die. They started with 30 frogs and raised the tadpoles. Later, they put 110 adult frogs back in the forest. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
