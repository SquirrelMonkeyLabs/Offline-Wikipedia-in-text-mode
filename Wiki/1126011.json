 "text": "The Chimbo rocket frog (Hyloxalus infraguttatus) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador and Colombia. Scientists think it could live in Peru too. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.7–20.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 19.5–23.4 long. This frog has dark marks on its back. There are white marks on the throat and belly. The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Home== This frog lives in forests on hills. It lives in places where the plants grow close together and where thorn plants grow. The frog lives near streams and other places where water flows, for example ditches. People have seen this frog between 70 and 1500 meters above sea level. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Reserva Ecológica Los Illinizas, Bosque Piemontano Occidental, and Bosque Montano Occidental. ==Young== The frog has young when the time of the year when it rains a lot ends. The male frogs fight each other for good places. The male frog calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground and under rocks. The male frog carries the tadpoles on his back. He carries them to water. The male frog cares for one group of eggs at a time and does not care for the tadpoles from more than one mother frog at the same time. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because people change its habitat to make farms, tree farms, and places for animals to eat grass. People also brought goats to this part of the world, and the goats are harming the forest too. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
