 "text": "David Balcombe Wingate OBE (born October 11, 1935, in Bermuda) is an ornithologist, naturalist and conservationist. In 1951 he and Robert Cushman Murphy and Louis S. Mowbray found the Bermuda petrel, also called a cahow. The bird species was thought to be extinct since the 1620s. The discovery inspired him to study Zoology at Cornell University. When he returned to Bermuda 1958, he began work to save the cahow. He went on to become the Conservation Officer for the Bermuda Government Parks Department from 1966 to his retirement in 2000. He was credited with rediscovering the black-capped petrel in Haiti in 1963. == Related pages == * List of scientists from North America == References == Category:Ornithologists Category:Naturalists Category:Ecologists Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Living people Category:1935 births Category:Bermudian people",
