 "text": "Geneviève Raugel (27 May 1951 – 10 May 2019) was a French mathematician. She worked in the field of numerical analysis and dynamical systems. Raugel worked for Centre national de la recherche scientifique, University of Rennes 1, École Polytechnique and at University of Paris-Sud. In the mid-1980s, she started working on the dynamics of evolution equations, in particular on global attractors,G. Raugel, Global Attractors in Partial Differential Equations, Handbook of Dynamical Systems, Elsevier, 2002, p. 885–982. perturbations, and Navier-Stokes equations on thin domains,G. Raugel et G. R. Sell, Navier-Stokes Equations on Thin 3D Domains. I: Global Attractors and Global Regularity of Solutions, Journal of the American Mathematical Society 6 (3), 503–568. where she was recognized a world expert. Raugel died on 10 May 2019 at the age of 68. ==References== ==Other websites== * ==Related pages== * Timeline of women in mathematics Category:1951 births Category:2019 deaths Category:French mathematicians",
