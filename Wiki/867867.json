 "text": "Almendariz's tree frog (Boana almendarizae) is a frog that lives in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 500 and 1950 meters up in the Andes Mountains. The adult male frog is 34.3 to 44.6 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 37.8 to 51.9 cm long. This frog's back is light brown to reddish brown in color, sometimes with dark bands or lines across. It has one larger medium-brown line down each side of its body, and small white and brown spots across its back. Some of the large female frogs have blue on their sides. Males have light blue on their sides. This frog has large eyes. This species hides during the day and looks for food at night. People find it on plants not more than 1.5 meters above the ground, especially near the edges of bodies of water, such as rivers, flooded places, and small ponds. This frog is sympatric with Boana calcarata. That means scientists think they had the same ancestor, and they became different frog species even though they lived in the same place. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
