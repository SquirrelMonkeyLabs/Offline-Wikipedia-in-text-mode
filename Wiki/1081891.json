 "text": "Stimulant psychosis is a mental disortder where people get symptoms similar to that of psychosis (for example hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, or being disorganized). Usually, it occurs after people take too many stimulants, over a longer time (usually days). One study found that it can also occur with regular prescribed drugs, in normal doses, in about 0.1% of the people (1 in 1000) who start amphetamine or methylphenidate therapy. Methamphetamine psychosis, or long-term effects of stimulant use in the brain (at the molecular level), depend upon genetics and may persist for some time. Treatment usually consists in assisting the patient in the acute phase, and making sure the person drinks lots of water and has normal blood pressure and body temperature. Typical and atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used to help treatment. == References == Category:Psychosis",
