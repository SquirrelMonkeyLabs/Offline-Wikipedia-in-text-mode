So far, none of these proposals (other than the second-level .kids.us domain) have come to be. Applications for a .kids domain have included: Blueberry Hill Communications, Inc.Summary of Application of Blueberry Hill Blueberry Hill is a domain name registration and hosting company in California. Neustar and Melbourne IT would subcontract operation of registry servers. Registrars would be selected under the same criteria and process currently imposed by ICANN. The .kids proposal would not rely on objective criteria for categorizing content. DotKids, Inc.Summary of Application of dotKids Inc DotKids, established in 2000 in Rosemont, Illinois intends to use SARAF Software Solutions Inc. for software development of a .kids registry. DotKids would deal only with ICANN accredited registrars; content rating information is to be retained in the registry and is to describe ratings for an entire site. ICM Registry, Inc.Summary of Application of ICM Registry ICM Registry requested the .xxx and .kids TLDs as a way to improve child safety on the Internet by restricting content across both TLDs and targeting a narrow registrant group. The original intent was a for-profit .xxx registry and a non-profit .kids registry. The .xxx domain portion of this proposal has since been rejected, largely due to US government objections. .KIDS Domains, Inc.Summary of Application of .Kids Domains .KIDS Domains is a California for-profit corporation; the proposed registry operator is Toronto- based domain name registrar Tucows Inc and .KIDS would be a restricted TLD. .KIDS Domains therefore does not intend to allow other registrars to register domain names in the .kids TLD. The European Parliament has also proposed .kid for websites designed for children. It would be monitored by an independent authority. == Technical == * .geo - Generic geographical locations. * .mail - A domain for e-mail networks, proposed to make fighting e-mail spam easier. * .web == Specialized and professional topics == * .med - Medical hospitals. * .eco - Environmental causes Al Gore says domain .eco logical * .post - Postal organizations. * .xxx - Adult entertainment. ==Other websites== * ICANN Proposed Top-Level Domain Registry Service * Web Campaigns Boost, Eurolang - ICANN discussed the proposed top-level domains at a conference on 3 July 2008 ==References== Category:Requested top-level domains",
