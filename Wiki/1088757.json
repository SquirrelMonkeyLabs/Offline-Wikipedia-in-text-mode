 "text": "Micro Mages is a platform game released by Morphcat Games in 2019 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It raised over â‚¬150,000 on Kickstarter. The game was released on a cartridge and later as a digital download on Steam and Itch.io. ==Development== The game uses 40 kilobytes (8 kilobytes for graphics and 32 kilobytes for code). This is because all NES games had to fit into that size when it was released. It was made using 6502 assembly language. Levels and animations use the same graphics to save space. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2019 video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Platform games",
