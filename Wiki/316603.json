 "text": "Urdă (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈurdə]) is the Romanian equivalent for Ricotta, a fresh white cheese made from whey of sheep, goat or cow. Urdă is produced by heating the whey resulting from the draining of any type of cheese. It is often made into molds to the shape of a half sphere. The paste is finely grained, silky and palatable. Since urdă is produced by Romanian shepherds since time immemorial in Romania, this product is considered a traditional Romanian dairy product. It is used especially in the preparation of several desserts as clătită and plăcintă. == References == Category:Romanian food Category:Cheeses",
