 "text": "The Baibung small tree frog (Theloderma baibengense) is a frog. It lives in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Scientists found some 82, 193, and 850 meters above sea level. This frog lives in places with lots of water that are not too high above sea level. It lives in high up in the tree branches, but sometimes male frogs sit on smaller woody plants at night. People have not seen it in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. Scientists have not found this frog's eggs or tadpoles, but they think it lays eggs in water-filled holes in trees like other frogs in Theloderma. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. But it is in some danger. People change the places where the frogs live to build roads and get wood to build with. At least one place the frog lives is a protected park: Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
