Rafts are different because they do not have a hull. Rafts are usually made of things like wood, barrels, or air chambers (for example, pontoons). These materials are usually buoyant (they float). Rafts are also not powered by an engine. Rafts can be made by humans or can happen in nature. Natural rafts are usually made from shrubbery or other organic matter.
