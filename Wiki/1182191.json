 "text": "A peroxy acid, also written peroxyacid or shortened to peracid, is an acid where an acidic hydrogen atom is bonded to two consecutive oxygen atoms. They have a hydroperoxide functional group, . Peroxy acids are weaker acids but stronger oxidizers than related oxoacids. == Production == Many oxoacids can be changed to peroxy acids in a chemical reaction with hydrogen peroxide. An example of this is the production of peroxymonosulfuric acid: : Organic peracids can be made from carboxylic acids or their derivatives, like acid anhydrides or acyl chlorides. == Uses == A major use for peroxy acids and their salts is the oxidation of alkenes into epoxides. If an organic peroxy acid is used, this is a name reaction called the Prilezhaev reaction. Potassium peroxymonosulfate, sold commercially in a mix of salts called Oxone, is an inorganic peroxy acid salt used in a similar reaction. == References == Category:Oxoacids Category:Oxidizing agents",
