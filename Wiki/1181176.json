 "text": "Anomaloglossus praderioi is a frog. Scientists found it in Venezuela and Guyana. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests where the branches come together like a roof in some places but not others and where there are many plants that live on top of other plants and mosses and small plants on the ground. People find the frogs far from water. They saw it between 1310 and 1950 meters above sea level. Scientists saw this frog inside Parque Nacional Canaima and they believe it may also live in Parque Nacional Monte Roraima. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Anomaloglossus do: They think female frog lays eggs on the ground. Scientists saw one male frog carrying five tadpoles on his back. They think the tadpoles swim in small pools that dry up for part of the year. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is in danger of dying out. Many of the frogs live in a place that human beings do not usually go to or change, but in other parts of the frog's home, people make fires that can reach high enough to hurt the frog. Climate change could also hurt this frog by changing the rain. Less rain would make the fires worse. Too much mining and too many visitors to the frog's home can also cause problems. About 3000-4000 visitors climb trails to the top of Mt. Roraima's tepui flatland each year. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
