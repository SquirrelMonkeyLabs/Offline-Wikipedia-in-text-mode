 "text": "The Prince Charles stream tree frog (Hyloscirtus princecharlesi) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it 2794 meters above sea level. They saw it in exactly one place, in a cloud forest. This frog is about 68.1-70.5 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog is black with orange spots. The iris of the eye is gray in color. The tadpoles are brown on color with small whitish marks. The iris of the eye is blue with some green-lavender color and white marks. The belly is red-brown on color. It is darker brown toward the tail. There are whitish spots. The tail is brown near the body and lighter near the end. Later, the tadpole changes color to gray. This frog is in danger because human beings change the places where it lives. Human beings cut down trees to get wood to build with and make a place for animals to eat grass. Chemicals that kill pests may also hurt this frog. The scientists named this frog after then-Prince of Wales, Charles Windsor. They named it after him because he worked to protect habitats in tropical places. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
