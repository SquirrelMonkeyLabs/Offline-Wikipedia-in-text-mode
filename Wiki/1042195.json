 "text": "Chrominae is a subfamily of the family Pomacentridae, which consists of the damselfishes and the clownfishes. ==Genera== The following genera are broken into the subfamily Chrominae: * Azurina D.S. Jordan & McGregor, 1898 * Chromis Cuvier, 1814 * Dascyllus Cuvier, 1829 * Pycnochromis Fowler, 1941 The genus Pycnochromis, which is not mentioned in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World, has been regarded as a junior synonym of Chromis but is now recognised as a valid genus by some authorities. In addition, the genera Acanthochromis and Altrichthys which the 5th edition of Fishes of the World included in this subfamily have been reclassified as belonging to the Pomacentrinae. ==References== Category:Pomacentridae",
