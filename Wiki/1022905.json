At the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference, Johnson received five percent of the presidential straw poll vote, coming in third place behind Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. == Campaign == Johnson has been campaigning in Iowa, hoping to win a large enough percentage in that state's caucus, the first in the primary. Johnson's campaign slogan is \"Two cents to save America\". This slogan his based on his policy where he wants to cut 2 cents off every dollar of federal budget. Johnson has promised to \"eliminate\" the FBI calling it a \"corrupt\". == Debates == Johnson did not qualify to appear in the Republican primary debates, because of his low polling numbers, and not enough donations to his campaign. To qualify for the debates, Johnson has been selling $1 t-shirts on Facebook saying \"I stand with Tucker\" and counting each sale as a donation to his campaign. == End == On October 20, 2023, Johnson ended his campaign and supported former President Donald Trump's re-election bid, after failing to qualify for any of the debates and for his low polling numbers. ==References== Category:2024 United States presidential campaigns",
