 "text": "Toby Bourke (7 February 1965) is an Irish singer and songwriter. He was brought up in London where he was a key figure in London’s Irish rock scene for twenty years. He has recorded three albums, two in-studio and one live, and currently has a fourth in production. Blood Sweat and Tears was recorded live at The Swan in Stockwell, London in 1992. In 1996 he was signed by George Michael for his Aegean label. He recorded a duet with Michael called \"Waltz Away Dreaming\" in 1997. The song was a top 10 hit, but the Aegean label folded soon after. \"Waltz Away Dreaming\" was included on Bourke’s next album Room 21. He continues to write and record from his base in Ireland where he lives with his wife and children. Toby Bourke is rumoured to be planning a tour for later in 2012. He is also rumoured to be writing a humorous, novel form account of his time in the music business. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Irish singer-songwriters",
