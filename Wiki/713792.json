 "text": "The National Assembly (; \"Country Assembly\") is the parliament of Hungary. It is made up of 199 (386 between 1990 and 2014) members elected to 4-year terms. The election of members is based on a system involving both area and list election. Parties must win at least 5% of the popular vote in order to enter the list of members of the assembly (but area winners enter regardless). The Assembly includes 25 standing committees to debate and report on introduced bills and to overlook the activities of the ministers. The Constitutional Court of Hungary has the right to challenge legislation on the grounds of constitutionality. The assembly has met in the Hungarian Parliament Building in Budapest since 1902.Katerina Zacharia, Hellenisms: culture, identity, and ethnicity from antiquity to modernity, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, p. 237 ==References== Hungary Hungary Category:Politics of Hungary Hungary",
