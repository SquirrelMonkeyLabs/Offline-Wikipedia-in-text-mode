It was supposed to be a little bit better than the F4F Wildcat, but became a big improvement. It was more powerful and could turn better. It was made to fight the Japanese A6M Zero. It was able to take off of aircraft carriers. It was also used by the navy as a \"night fighter\", with radar so it could fly at night. During the war, it had the most aces fly it. It was retired in 1954. The Hellcat was a rival to the Vought F4U Corsair and had more aerial victories and participated in more missions. The F6F was equipped with Browning Machine Guns, and had external fuel tanks for longer range. It had the same engine as the F4U. The armor of the Hellcat was better than that on other aircraft. ==References== Notes Category:United States Navy aircraft Category:United States Marine Corps aircraft Category:British military aircraft Category:French military aircraft Category:World War II American aircraft F6F",
