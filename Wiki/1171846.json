 "text": "Volvo Island is a small artificial island in a flooded strip mine near Ottawa, Illinois, USA. It is named after its only occupant, a 2001 Volvo S80 sedan, which has been there since January 2012, making it a unique local landmark. == History == Volvo Island was created by Scott Mann, an Ottawa resident and car repair shop owner. The site was once a mine that later filled with water, forming a lake. In early 2012, Mann placed a car on a peninsula using a tow truck, then used an excavator to remove the connecting land, isolating the car on its own small island. Scott Mann initially planned a contest for people to guess how the Volvo was placed on the island but abandoned the idea due to safety concerns. Despite this, he proceeded with the project for fun, hoping it would draw attention to his shop. == Public reception == Volvo Island has gained popularity as a tourist attraction over the years. Visible on Google Maps and Street View since 2015, it has drawn increasing interest. As of recent accounts, it holds a 4.9-star rating on Google with over 300 reviews, with visitors praising it as \"majestic\" and a \"premier tourist attraction.\" == Current status == Despite over a decade of exposure to the elements, the 2001 Volvo S80 remains on Volvo Island, appearing relatively intact. There are no plans to remove the vehicle or modify the island.. ==References== Category:Uninhabited islands Category:Artificial islands Category:Islands Category:Pages using gadget WikiMiniAtlas",
