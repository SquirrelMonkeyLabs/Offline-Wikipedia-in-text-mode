It is named after the explorer John McDouall Stuart, and much of the road follows the route he took on his epic journey in 1862. The highway is promoted as a tourist attraction, called the \"Explorer's Way\". For many years in Australia it was simply known as \"The Track\". Towns on the highway include Marla, Coober Pedy, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek and Katherine. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Explorer's Way Category:Highways in Australia",
