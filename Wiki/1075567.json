 "text": "Lethal Company is a cooperative survival horror video game made by Zeekerss. It was released for PC on Steam on October 23rd, 2023. Players must look for scrap and trash on moons, while trying to stay safe from traps, monsters, and other dangers. They are employees working for \"The Company\" and must reach a set quota, or profit goal, by selling the things found on moons. They have 3 days to complete their goal, which becomes higher after every time a goal is reached. == Gameplay == Lethal Company is a cooperative video game for as many as four players played in a first-person perspective. Players can talk to each other using their microphones, as well as by typing. They must collect as much scrap and trash as possible on different moons. Every moon has one building with random rooms inside, which is where they find the scrap and trash they need. While exploring these buildings, players may encounter traps and monsters inside. They must avoid these dangers while collecting things, and then go to the spaceship safely before it flies away at midnight. Things found on the moons can be sold on the Company moon to get company credits, which is a type of money that can be used in the Company store. Players can use their credits to buy tools that can help them stay safe on dangerous moons. They must get a set number of credits every 3 days. After those 3 days, the goal gets bigger, and players must get more things to sell. If the goal is not reached, they are sent into space and killed. Players may use a computer on the ship to buy things with credits and watch other players on a screen. While watching players, someone on the ship may type codes to open locked metal doors and turn off things such as turrets and land mines. The game has 8 moons for players to go on, including the Company moon where players sell items. Every moon has a different danger level which tells players how many monsters and traps they may see. More danger on a moon also means more items found on it. Some moons may have dangerous weather conditions that make it harder for players to collect items. == Reception == Lethal Company has received good reviews. It was on Steam's Global Top Seller list in November 2023. Some people have compared it to Phasmophobia. == References == Category:Upcoming video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Early access video games Category:Horror video games Category:Indie video games Category:Open-world video games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Windows games",
