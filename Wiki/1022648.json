 "text": "Neeraj Chopra (born December 24, 1997) is an Indian track and field athlete. He is a player of the javelin throw. He is the first In and field athlete to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Chopra was born in Khandra village in Panipat, Haryana. == International Beginnings (2013–2016) == Neeraj made his international debut in 2013 at the World Youth Championships in Donetsk, Ukraine, where he secured 19th place with a best throw of 66.75 meters. The following year, he earned his first international accolade—a silver medal—at the Youth Olympics Qualification event in Bangkok. In 2014, during the senior nationals, Neeraj achieved a significant milestone by recording his first throw exceeding 70 meters (230 feet). His breakthrough came in 2015 when he set a new world junior record at the All India Inter-University Athletics meet, throwing 81.04 meters (265.9 feet), marking his first throw over 80 meters (260 feet). Despite finishing fifth at the 2015 National Games in Kerala and placing 9th at the 2015 Asian Athletics Championships with a best throw of 70.50 meters, Neeraj's performance earned him a spot at the national- level training camp at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports in Patiala in early 2016. Reflecting on this period, Neeraj cited it as a turning point in his career, as the enhanced training facilities, improved nutrition, and the opportunity to train alongside other national-level javelin throwers significantly boosted his confidence. He was also mentored by 2010 Commonwealth Games bronze medalist Kashinath Naik, which further elevated his training regimen. == References == Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Indian athletes Category:Olympic gold medalists for India Category:Javelin throwers",
