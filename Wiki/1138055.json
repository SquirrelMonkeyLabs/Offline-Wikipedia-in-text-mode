 "text": "Elizabeth of Hungary, also known as Elizabeth of Th√ºringen and St. Elizabeth, ( 7 July 1207 - 17 November 1231) was the daughter of King Andrew of Hungary. She was married to the aristocrat Ludwig of Thuringia, together they had three children. Elizabeth was focused on helping those less fortunate than her. When Thuringia's lands were flooded Elizabeth built a hospital to help everyone she could. She even gave away clothes and objects from the royal house. She wore simple clothes and would stand at the castle gates, giving bread to the poor. After Ludwig's death, Elizabeth swore that she would never marry again. Ludwig's family threw her out, because they looked down on her for giving so much away to the poor. She could no longer take care of her children and sent them away. She put the money she had left into another hospital, where she herself worked, helping the sick patients. She died in November 1231. Four years after her death she was made into a saint. == References == Category:1207 births Category:1231 deaths Category:Christian saints Category:Princes and princesses",
