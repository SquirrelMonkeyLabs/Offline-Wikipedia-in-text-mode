 "text": "A Patient transport service carries people to and from medical services when there isn't an emergency. This may be to or from their own home or a hospital or care home. The transport usually has life-support equipment, and people with fewer qualifications than ambulance people. Some services are run commercially and some by government healthcare services. In the United Kingdom there is a separate Hospital Travel Costs scheme which gives people help with the costs of these journeys. Category:Healthcare",
