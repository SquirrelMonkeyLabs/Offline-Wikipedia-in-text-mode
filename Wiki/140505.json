 "text": "A Clockwork Orange is a 1971 British-American crime drama thriller movie. It was written, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. It is based on Anthony Burgess' 1962 short novel A Clockwork Orange. It includes disturbing, violent images. Its social commentary touches on psychiatry, youth gangs, and other social, political and economic subjects in a dystopian vision of a not-too- future Britain. Kubrick stopped the film being shown in Britain, concerned about its possible effects. For 27 years, it was difficult to see the film in the United Kingdom. It reappeared in cinemas and the VHS and DVD releases followed, soon after Kubrick's death in 1999. In 2020, A Clockwork Orange was selected by the Library of Congress into the United States National Film Registry. == Cast == * Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge (or Burgess) * Warren Clarke as Dim * James Marcus as Georgie * Patrick Magee as Frank Alexander * Adrienne Corri as Mrs. Alexander * Carl Duering as Dr. Brodsky * Madge Ryan as Dr. Branom * Godfrey Quigley as Prison Chaplain * Anthony Sharp as Minister (of Interior) * Sheila Raynor as Mum * Philip Stone as Dad * David Prowse as Julian * Michael Bates as Chief Guard * Aubrey Morris as Mr. P.R.
