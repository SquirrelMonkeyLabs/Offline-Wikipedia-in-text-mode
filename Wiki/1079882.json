 "text": "The Daily Bugle (later the DB!) is an American fictional tabloid newspaper based in New York City. It appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Daily Bugle is a regular fixture in the Marvel Universe, mostly in Spider-Man publications. The newspaper first appeared in the Human Torch story in Marvel Mystery Comics #18 (April 1941). It returned in Fantastic Four #2 (January 1962), and its offices were first depicted in The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963). It operates from the Daily Bugle Building located on 39th Street and Second Avenue. It was once one of the most read newspapers in the United States of America. == In other media == The Daily Bugle was first featured on film in the 2002 movie Spider-Man. The fictional newspaper is meant to be a pastiche of both the New York Daily News and the New York Post, two popular real-life New York City tabloids. The outlet appears in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002–07), Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man duology (2012–14) and Sony's Spider-Man Universe (2018–present). The agency is reimagined as a sensationalist news website in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), the SSU movie Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), and the web series The Daily Bugle (2019–present), headlined by J. K. Simmons and Angourie Rice as J. Jonah Jameson and Betty Brant. An alternate version of the web series hosted by Nicque Marina was featured in promotional material for the SSU movie Morbius (2022).
