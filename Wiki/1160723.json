 "text": "Allobates insperatus is a frog. It lives in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 16.02 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 16.25 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color with a light brown stripe on each side of the body. There is also a dark brown stripe on each side of the body. The belly can be cream or yellow-white in color. The throat can be cream-yellow or light gray in color. ==Home== People see this frog hiding near tree roots, in palm leaves, and on dead leaves on the ground. It lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that are growing back. It does not need to live near streams. Scientists have seen the frog between 250 and 570 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog inside Güeppi-Sekime National Park. There are more protected parks in the place where the frog lives: Parque Nacional Cuyabeno, Parque Nacional Yasuní, Parque Nacional Sumaco Napo-Galeras, and scientists think it could live in these parks too. ==Young== This frog does not need to live near streams. Its tadpoles can swim in streams, but they can also swim in water in pieces of palm plants that have fallen to the ground, in water in pieces of bamboo plants that have fallen to the ground, and in small pools of water. ==Danger== Scientists from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature say this frog is not in danger of dying out from the world. The government of Ecuador says this frog is in only a little danger of dying out in Ecuador. Human beings do change the places where it lives to make farms, make places to raise animals, get wood to build with, and look for oil. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
