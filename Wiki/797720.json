 "text": "On 10 November 2019, after 21 days of civil protests following the disputed election results of October 2019 and the release of a report from the Organization of American States (OAS), which showed irregularities in the electoral process, trade unions, the military and the police of Bolivia asked president Evo Morales to resign. Morales resigned and was offered political asylum to Morales the following day, which Morales accepted a day afterwards. The second vice president of the Senate, opposition senator Jeanine Áñez, assumed the role of president on 12 November, being the next in line for the presidency. Morales has called for the Bolivian people to reject the leadership of Áñez. He and his supporters argue that the event was a coup d'état. ==References== Category:21st century in Bolivia Category:November 2019 events Category:2019 in South America Category:Politics of Bolivia",
