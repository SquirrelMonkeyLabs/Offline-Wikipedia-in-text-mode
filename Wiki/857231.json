 "text": "Lahmacun, also spelled Lahmajoon, is a Middle Eastern dish. The name Lahmacun comes from Arabic (لحم بعجين \"lahma bi'ajeen\") meaning meat and dough. Lahmacun is often described as Turkish Pizza or Armenian Pizza but it is not a pizza because it doesn’t have cheese on it. Lahmacun is topped with minced meat with herbs and spices and cooked in a clay oven. It can be wrapped around like a burrito with salad inside or eaten as a flat bread. == References == Category:Turkish food Category:Middle Eastern foods",
