 "text": "Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a chronic (long-term) infection of the lymphatic system caused by three different types of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The bacteria spread through sexual contact. The infection is not caused by the same bacteria that cause genital chlamydia. LGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America. Every year, a few hundred cases of LGV are diagnosed in the United States. However, the actual number of infections is unknown. LGV is more common in men than women. The main risk factor is being HIV-positive. Symptoms of LGV can begin a few days to a month after coming in contact with the bacteria. Symptoms include: * Blood or pus from the rectum (blood in the stools) * Drainage through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin * Painful bowel movements (tenesmus) * Small painless sore on the male genitals or in the female genital tract * Swelling and redness of the skin in the groin area * Swelling of the labia * Swollen groin lymph nodes on one or both sides; it may also affect lymph nodes around the rectum in people who have anal intercourse * Diarrhea and lower abdominal pain.
