 "text": "The Margaret River is a river in southwest Western Australia. It is the source of the name of the town and tourist region of Margaret River. The river arises from an area of just 40 square kilometres in the Whicher Range. There is a weir across the river just above the town. The mouth of the river is a small estuary. It is closed to the ocean by a sandbar but opens seasonally. Margaret River is thought to be named after Margaret Wyche, cousin of John Garrett Bussell (founder of Busselton) in 1832. ==References== Category:Rivers of Western Australia",
