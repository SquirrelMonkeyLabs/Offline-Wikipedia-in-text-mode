 "text": "Most countries have laws which regulate sexual activity. These laws have been influenced by social norms: * In general, all people are free to choose if they want to have sex, and with whom they want to have sex. * There is a certain age, called the age of consent. People younger than this age cannot agree that they want to have sex with someone. Often, there are exceptions to this, so that people who are about the same age do not fall under this rule. People who are unable to consent, for example because they are sleeping, or unconscious or because they have a mental illness are also protected by that rule. * Sometimes, there are norms that say that people must not have sex with close relatives. * Some countries have laws that say that people that are not married must not have sex, or that having sex with someone other than your spouse is a crime. Forcing someone to have sex, or having sex with someone who is unable to consent is a crime. In general, this is called sex abuse. Other behaviors, which are not directly related to sexual intercourse are often also covered: * Exhibitionism * Homosexuality is illegal in some countries * Forcing someone to marry is illegal. Marrying someone who is still a child is often also illegal. * Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a crime in most countries. * Violence and abuse that occur between people living together are often illegal. They are difficult to find, though, because often they are not reported. Category:Sexual law",
