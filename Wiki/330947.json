He played college football for the Virginia Tech Hokies. He played relatively well with Virginia Tech, where he wore number 5, but was not drafted until the 6th round by the Baltimore Ravens in 2011. With the Ravens, Taylor moved on from a preseason injury and played in three games as the backup to starter Joe Flacco. He rushed for two yards in one game, lined up as a wide receiver in another, and completed an 18-yard pass to Anquan Boldin as well. He was on the roster when the Ravens won Super Bowl XLVII and defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31. Taylor left Baltimore after four years for the Buffalo Bills, becoming the starter for three years. He was named to a Pro Bowl after a strong first season as the starting quarterback, then in 2017, helped the team make the playoffs for the first time since 1999. Following that season, the Bills traded him to the Cleveland Browns, where he played one year before joining the Chargers in 2019. ==References== ==Other websites== *Tyrod Taylor at NFL.com Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Baltimore Ravens players Category:Buffalo Bills players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Houston Texans players Category:Los Angeles Chargers players Category:New York Giants players Category:African- American players of American football Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Sportspeople from Virginia Category:People from Hampton, Virginia",
