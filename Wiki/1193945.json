 "text": "Upper Nubia is the southernmost part of Nubia, upstream on the Nile from Lower Nubia. It is so called because the Nile flows north, so it is further upstream and of higher elevation in relation to Lower Nubia. The extension of Upper Nubia is rather ill-defined and depends on the researchersâ€™ approach. == History == Historically speaking Upper Nubia comprises the areas of influence of the Nubian part of New Kingdom of Egypt or the kingdom of Kush or Meroe.
