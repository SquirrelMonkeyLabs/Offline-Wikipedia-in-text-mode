 "text": "Roland (said as \"Ro-lan\" in French) was a leader in the army of Charlemagne, a king long ago. He lived in a time called the Middle Ages and died on August 15, 778. Roland was in charge of guarding the border of Francia (a place that later became France) to keep it safe from the Bretons. A man named Einhard wrote about Roland in a book about Charlemagne's life. It says Roland was part of a group attacked and killed by the Basques in Spain during a fight called the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. After his death, people told and wrote stories that made Roland's life seem bigger and more exciting than it really was. The most famous story is a long poem called The Song of Roland, written in the 11th century. Later, Italian poets wrote even more stories about Roland, such as Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso. These tales were even less true to history. Another story, called Morgante, was written by Luigi Pulci. In these stories, Roland had a special sword named Durendal, a brave horse named Veillantif, and a horn called an oliphant. In the 1600s, a man named Jean- Baptiste Lully wrote music for an opera called Roland, based on the story of this famous hero. == History == The only time the real Roland is written about is in a book called Vita Karoli Magni, written by Einhard, who worked for Charlemagne and told his life story. Einhard calls Roland Hruodlandus Brittannici limitis praefectus, meaning \"Roland, leader of the border of Brittany.\" This shows that Roland was in charge of the Breton March, the border area of Francia next to the Bretons. Roland was likely the first leader chosen to handle Frankish matters with the Bretons because the earlier Merovingian kings had no special dealings with them. Castles near the border, like those in Vitré and Ille-et-Vilaine, south of Mont Saint-Michel, are now part of Normandy and Brittany. The unique culture there still keeps the Gallo language and stories about heroes like Roland. The next leader of Brittany after Roland was Guy of Nantes. Like Roland, he could not expand Frankish rule over Brittany but only kept it as part of the Carolingian Empire. Stories say that Roland was buried at a church in Blaye, near Bordeaux, where a fortress once stood. == Medieval icon == Roland became a famous and important figure in medieval Europe and the culture of singers and storytellers. Many stories made him Charlemagne’s nephew and turned his life into a great tale of a brave Christian hero killed by enemies. His story is part of the \"Matter of France,\" a group of old French legends. The story of Roland’s death is told in The Song of Roland, a poem from the 11th century. In it, Roland has a special horn called an olifant to call for help and a magical sword named Durendal, filled with holy Christian relics. This poem tells a dramatic, romantic version of the Battle of Roncevaux Pass, where Roland dies, creating the style for later stories about Charlemagne’s court. In the Middle Ages, many different versions of Roland's story were made. One is a Latin story called Historia Caroli Magni (also called the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle), which tells how Roland fought a giant named Ferracutus, who could only be hurt at his belly button. Another version is the Entrée d'Espagne from about 1320, and an Italian story called La Spagna, written in the 1300s. Other stories tell about Roland's life and adventures. His friendship with Olivier and his engagement to Olivier's sister Aude are in Girart de Vienne by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube. His younger years and how he got his horse Veillantif and sword are in Aspremont. In Quatre Fils Aymon, he sometimes fights a knight named Renaud de Montauban. In Norway, Roland’s tales are in a collection of stories called Karlamagnús saga from the 13th century. In The Divine Comedy by Dante, Roland, called Orlando in Italian, is seen in the Heaven of Mars with other warriors of faith. Roland also appears in Entrée d'Espagne, where he is like a wandering knight, similar to King Arthur's knights, and in La Spagna. From the 15th century, he became a main character in Italian stories like Morgante by Luigi Pulci, Orlando Innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo, and Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Later, Pietro Aretino’s Orlandino made fun of the way Roland was worshipped as a hero. His story inspired composers like Claudio Monteverdi, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Antonio Vivaldi, and George Frideric Handel, who made an opera called Orlando. In Germany, Roland became a symbol of freedom for cities from local rulers. Many cities built statues of Roland in their market squares. The statue in Wedel was made in 1450 to show justice, and the statue in front of Bremen City Hall, made in 1404, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Faroe Islands, Roland appears in the ballad Runtsivalstríðið (The Battle of Roncevaux).

In Catalonia, Roland (called Rotllà in Catalan) became a giant in stories. Many places in both North and South Catalonia are named after Rotllà. In the Pyrenees region, the Basques also have tales of Errolan, a giant who could throw huge stones. The Basque word for giant, erraldoi, comes from the name Errol(d)an, as explained by the linguist Koldo Mitxelena. Jean Lannes, a French military leader under Napoleon, was nicknamed Roland of the Army of Italy, later called Roland of the Grand Army, because he was brave and charming. In Brazil, a statue of Roland stands in the city of Rolândia, which was founded by German immigrants, including people fleeing Nazi Germany. They named the city after Roland to symbolize freedom. In the game Fate/Grand Order, Roland appears as a loyal servant of God and a noble knight. The English phrase \"to give a Roland for an Oliver\" means to return a favor or respond equally. This saying comes from The Song of Roland and the friendship between Roland and his companion Oliver.Brown, Lesley, ed. (1993). The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Vol. 2.
