 "text": "Double or Nothing (2020) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on May 23, 2020 in Jacksonville, Florida, mainly at the Daily's Place, with the Stadium Stampede match taking place at TIAA Bank Field, home of Tony Khan's Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the second Double or Nothing event held by AEW and the first AEW PPV to happen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, the event took place behind closed doors, although a few AEW wrestlers and staff members appeared in the crowd. The main event saw Matt Hardy and The Elite (Adam Page, Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson) defeat The Inner Circle (Chris Jericho, Jake Hager, Sammy Guevara, Santana, and Ortiz) in the first ever Stadium Stampede match. On the show, Brian Cage made his AEW debut, and boxing legend Mike Tyson appeared to reward Cody Rhodes with the AEW TNT Championship. ==Matches== No. Matches Stipulations Times 1 Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent) defeated Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) Tag team match to become the #1 contender for the AEW World Tag Team Championship 15:10 2 Brian Cage (with Taz) defeated Darby Allin, Colt Cabana, Orange Cassidy, Joey Janela, Scorpio Sky, Kip Sabian (with Jimmy Havoc and Penelope Ford), Frankie Kazarian, and Luchasaurus Casino Ladder Match for a AEW World Championship match in the future 28:30 3 MJF (with Wardlow) defeated Jungle Boy Singles match 17:20 4 Cody (with Arn Anderson) defeated Lance Archer (with Jake Roberts) AEW TNT Championship tournament finals match 22:00 5 Kris Statlander defeated Penelope Ford (with Kip Sabian) Singles match 5:30 6 Dustin Rhodes (with Brandi Rhodes) defeated Shawn Spears Singles match for the AEW TNT Championship 3:20 7 Hikaru Shida defeated Nyla Rose (c) No Disqualification, No Countout match for the AEW Women's World Championship 16:40 8 Jon Moxley (c) defeated Mr. Brodie Lee Singles match for the AEW World Championship 15:30 9 The Elite (\"Hangman\" Adam Page, Kenny Omega, Matt Hardy, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson) defeated The Inner Circle (Chris Jericho, Jake Hager, Sammy Guevara, Santana, and Ortiz) Stadium Stampede match 34:00 == Footnotes == ==References== Category:AEW Double or Nothing Category:2020s in Jacksonville, Florida Category:2020 in sports in Florida",
