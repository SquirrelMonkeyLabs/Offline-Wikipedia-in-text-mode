 "text": "The Jaguars (ザ・ジャガーズ, Za jagāzu) is a Japanese group sound band that was created in 1964 until 1971. The band sung many both Japanese and English music covers, manly The Rolling Stones, The Nashville Teens, Paul Revere And The Raiders, and other American and British band groups. == Overview == The predecessor of The Jaguars was active as an electric group at jazz cafes under the name of \"Yukio Miya and The Play Five\" in April 1964. In 1965, they began to appear regularly on electric programs such as the TV programs \"Beat No. 1\" and \"Young Pops Excite\", and the band's name recognition gradually increased. In May of the following year, Shin Okamoto, who was a 16 year old vocalist from Kanagawa at that time, reluctantly joined the group and they became popular in the magazines and songs. The Play Five was renamed to The Jaguars in June 1967 and made their record debut with \"Kimi Niaitai\" (Want To See You Again). This debut songs was a big hit, and popular songs such as \"Dancing Lonely Night\" and \"Mademoiselle Bruce\" were skipped one after another. In March 1968, The Jaguars appeared in many televisions shows and there was a movie called \"Make Way For The Jaguars\" (directed by Yôichi Maeda and produced by Shochiku), but at the end of the same month, the band leader Yukio Miya withdrew due to internal conflict with the music directors. After Yukio left the group, 19 year old Takeshi Hamano joined the alternative drums in April and Shin became the leader of the group at the age of 20. In June, they released a hit song \"The Legend of Xanadu\" and in September with \"Two People In The Starry Sky\", but in January 1969, \"Bruce for Lovers\" was a remarkably popular song like other Group Sounds songs. It has been turned into a musical stage play. Around this time, the GS genre began to fade as disco and funky music flourished in Japan, and lead guitarist Hisayuki Okitsu left the group due to illness treatment, and in 1970, keyboardist Yasuji Sato and Takeshi Hamano also left. After \"Someday Someone\" released in April 1970, they became active in nightclubs in Tokyo without a release song in 1971, but did not hold any dissolution concerts, and The Jaguars ended in July 1971. After appearing in \"Goodbye Nikki Western Carnival\" in 1981, the band was reunited when \"Want To Meet You\" song was a commercial for Asahi Breweries, but in 2009, due to the death of Shin Okamoto, the band dissolved again. == Members == * Yukio Miya (drums, November 16, 1937 - October 29, 2013), Leader, formed The New Jaguars after leaving the group in March 1968.
