 "text": "Marcel-François Lefebvre (29 November 1905 – 25 March 1991), better known as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, was a French Roman Catholic bishop. For a long time, he worked as a missionary in Africa with the Holy Ghost Fathers. After returning, he started to be against the changes within the Church. These changes were introduced after the Second Vatican Council. In 1970, Lefebvre founded the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), which is still the world's largest Traditionalist Catholic priestly society. In 1988, Lefebvre made four new bishops to continue his work with the SSPX. He took this step against the orders of Pope John Paul II. Because of this, the Holy See announced the following day that he had been excommunicated from the Catholic Church. Those who supported Lefebvre think, this declaration was not valid. Lefebvre died from cancer on 25 March 1991 at the age of 85 in Martigny, Switzerland. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Roman Catholic missionaries Category:People excommunicated by the Catholic Church Category:French Roman Catholic bishops Category:People from Tourcoing Category:Cancer deaths in Switzerland",
