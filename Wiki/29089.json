 "text": "Romanticism (or Romantic movement) is a movement, or style of art, literature and music in the late 18th and early 19th century in Europe. The movement said that feelings, imagination, nature, human life, freedom of expression, individualism and old folk traditions, such as legends and fairy tales, were important. It was a reaction to the aristocratic social and political ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. It was also a reaction against turning nature into a mere science. The movement showed most strongly in arts like music, and literature. However, it also had an important influence on historiography,David Levin, History as Romantic Art: Bancroft, Prescott, and Parkman (1967) education,Gerald Lee Gutek, A history of the Western educational experience (1987) ch. 12 on Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and natural history.Ashton Nichols, \"Roaring Alligators and Burning Tygers: Poetry and Science from William Bartram to Charles Darwin,\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 2005 149(3): 304-315 == Examples == === United Kingdom === Romanticism in Britain was notable as the country was an early adopter of industrialization and science, and included such figures as: * William Wordsworth * Samuel Taylor Coleridge * Lord Byron * Shelley * William Blake * Robert Burns * Walter Scott *J.
