 "text": "Chinese postal romanization was the old way of spelling Chinese place names in the Roman alphabet until the 1980s, when Hanyu Pinyin became the standard way for writing Chinese in the Roman alphabet worldwide. While mainland China uses only Hanyu Pinyin for almost all Chinese place names, Taiwan still uses Chinese postal romanization to spell their cities' names, like Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung. In this system, there are no apostrophes, dashes, or tone markers. Category:Romanization of Chinese",
