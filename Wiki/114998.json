 "text": "Pikmin is a real-time strategy video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube, and later the Wii and Switch. The plot involves an alien captain named Captain Olimar who crash-lands on a planet and meets creatures called Pikmin, which he uses to protect himself and find his ship parts before he runs out of air. ==Plot== ===Setting=== The in-game universe has many locations, including a planet known as Hocotate, where Olimar is from, and a planet that resembles Earth. In-game, the planet is from a small perspective, as both Olimar and the Pikmin are no larger than US quarters. ===Summary=== Captain Olimar is traveling in his spaceship called the Dolphin, when it suddenly collides with a meteor and crashes on an unknown planet resembling Earth. He travels for a bit before he finds a creature called a Pikmin. He meets up with other Pikmin, and has to use them to gather up the pieces he lost from his ship before 30 days run out, or the game will be over. ==Gameplay== The player controls Captain Olimar, who can throw the Pikmin. Pikmin are plucked out of the ground, and they live in a nest called an onion when they are not deployed. There can be up to 100 different Pikmin out of the onions at any moment. There are three kinds of Pikmin, stronger Red Pikmin, immune to fire, lighter Yellow Pikmin, who can pick up bomb rocks, and Blue Pikmin, immune to water. ==Music== Music from Pikmin was used in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, including \"Ai no Uta\" (in Japanese and French). It also reappears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as Olimar appears in those games. ==Reception== Pikmin got good reviews and is considered one of the best GameCube launch games. Reviewers liked its strategic gameplay, but a lot complained about the time limit, saying it made it harder to play the game outside of the main task. ===Legacy=== Because of Pikmin's popularity, Captain Olimar and his Pikmin appeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, along with other creatures and characters as trophies. Olimar also appeared in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a fighter. ==Sequels== Pikmin had a sequel called Pikmin 2 in 2004 for the GameCube as well. Another Pikmin game, Pikmin 3, was released on August 4, 2013 for the Wii U, and later, the Nintendo Switch as Pikmin 3 Deluxe. On July 21, 2023, Pikmin 4 was released for the Nintendo Switch.
