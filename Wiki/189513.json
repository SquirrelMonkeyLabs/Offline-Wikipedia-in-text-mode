 "text": "The Swell Season are an Academy Award winning folk rock duo. The members are Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Hansard is a member of the Irish band The Frames. Irglova is a classically trained Czech pianist and singer. The duo won the Academy Award for Best Song in 2008. The Swell Session made their first album, The Swell Season, in 2006. It was just after the release of the Frames' sixth CD, The Cost. Hansard and Irglová also appeared as working-class immigrants in the popular Irish movie, Once. The movie was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. The next year, they won the Academy Award for Best Song for the song \"Falling Slowly\" from that movie . Hansard is the first Irish-born person to win in that category. Irglová is the first Czech woman to win an Oscar. At age 19, she became the youngest person to win an Oscar in a musical category. The soundtrack, Once: Music from the Motion Picture, was certified as gold in February 2008. They went on tour and performed to sold- out crowds in many countries. Hansard and Irglová also recorded a version of Bob Dylan's \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" for the movie I'm Not There in 2007. During the tour, Hansard and Irglová began dating. Hansard said, \"I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid\". In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now \"good friends.\" == Oscar ceremony == Hansard and Irglová performed \"Falling Slowly\" live on the Oscar broadcast at Los Angeles' Kodak Theater on February 24, 2008. When they went on stage to receive their awards, Irglova's acceptance speech was stopped by the orchestra's music cue to leave the stage. Host Jon Stewart asked her back to give her speech after the commercial break. Ceremony director Gil Cates said the early cue was an accident. ==References== Category:Musical duos Category:Academy Award winners",
