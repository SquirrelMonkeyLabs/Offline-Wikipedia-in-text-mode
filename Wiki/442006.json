 "text": "A fried egg is an egg cooked in a pan, typically with oil or butter. It is a common dish that can be prepared in different ways, including sunny side up (with the yolk facing up and not flipped), over easy (flipped to cook the other side slightly), or well-done (cooked until the yolk is firm). Fried eggs can be served alone or as part of other dishes, such as sandwiches, salads, or alongside rice and other sides. Category:Egg dishes Category:Fried foods",
