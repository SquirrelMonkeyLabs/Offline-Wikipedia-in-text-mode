 "text": "Golden in terms of Chinese zodiacs is meant to represent good fortune and prosperity. Years of the Golden Pig for example are viewed as extremely fortunate to be born on as your luck is considered the highest possible within the zodiac system. \"Throughout the history of mankind Billions of people have died due to \"normal\" causes, these causes include disease, war, and more. However every single person that has died up into this point has actually died because of the luck they were ascribed at birth.\" - Chinese Philosopher Mencius. The biggest reason for the luck system in China is simply superstition, something that was created simply out of fear of being born on the wrong year. They needed something to blame rather than themselves so they created fortune and blamed it, ultimately leading to the creation of this system. Golden has roots in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Vagabond, Sakamoto Desu Ga, and The World of Machida Kun, see prior links for continued analysis of the meaning of Golden in Chinese Zodiacs. ==References== Category:Chinese culture",
