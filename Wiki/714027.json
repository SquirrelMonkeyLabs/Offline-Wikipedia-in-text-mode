 "text": "Garage punk is a rock music genre. It combines the sounds of garage rock, punk rock, and other forms, that started in the indie rock underground between the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bands were influenced from stripped-down 1970s punk rock and Detroit proto-punk. They used many other styles in their sound, such as power pop, 1960s girl groups and garage rock, hardcore punk, early blues and R&B;, and surf rock. ==References== Category:Rock music Category:Punk rock Category:Fusion music genres",
