 "text": "The Treaties of Fort Stanwix (1768, 1784) were treaties between Iroquois Confederacy and British and Americans.Richter, Daniel K. The Ordeal of the Longhouse: The Peoples of the Iroquois League in the Era of European Colonization. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1992. The Iroquois gave up lands in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, West Virginia, and New York. The first treaty (1768) was between the Iroquois and the British. It created the Line of Property between Iroquois tribes and the Thirteen colonies. Colonists and the Penn Family got lands in Pennsylvania. This changed the former Royal Proclamation of 1763.Peter Marshall, \"Sir William Johnson and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, 1768.\" Journal of American Studies (1967) 1#2 pp 149-179. The second treaty (1784) was after the American Revolution and between the Iroquois and the United States. Americans wanted to expand westward. They realized that the Line of Property was not enough. This treaty weakened the Iroquois.Tucker, Spencer C. (2014). \"Fort Stanwix Treaty (October 22, 1784)\".
