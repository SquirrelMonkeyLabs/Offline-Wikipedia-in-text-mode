 "text": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a skateboarding video game. It was published by Activision and was developed by Vicarious Visions. It is a remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Pro Skater 2. It is also the first main game on consoles since disastrous release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 in 2015. It was released on September 4, 2020 for the PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One, March 26, 2021 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and June 25, 2021 for Nintendo Switch. The game would later be released on Steam and on October 3, 2023. The game was made with help from former employees of Neversoft. Like in the original games and most games in the series, the player can do skateboarding tricks and grinds to boost their score while skating around the levels. There are also objectives in the game such as getting a certain amount of score from tricks, collecting letters that spell out SKATE, and collecting secret DVDs. There are 21 different skaters that the player can choose from. There are also 3 secret characters to choose from. Spider-Man didn't return as a secret skater because of issues with licensing the character. The player can also create their own skater. There were plans to create a sequel which would have been a remake of both Pro Skater 3 and Pro Skater 4 but the game was cancelled after the merger of Activision and Blizzard Entertainment on January 22, 2021. ==Reception== The game was given very positive reviews by game critics. Critics said that the game was a huge bounceback for the Tony Hawk's series after the terrible release of Pro Skater 5 in 2015. They said they liked the attention to detail, improved graphics, better controls, and new songs and skaters. The diversity of the skaters was also applauded. Critics would also say that they didn't like the loading times, saying that they took too long. The game would also win many awards. Among the awards won, it has been named Best Sports Game at Gamescom Awards, Best Sports/Racing Game at the The Game Awards, and Sports Game of the Year at the D.I.C.E. Awards. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2020 video games Category:Tony Hawk video games Category:Activision video games Category:Vicarious Visions games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Skateboarding video games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games set in France Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
