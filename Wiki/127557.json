 "text": "Stephen Reid Bradley (born August 23, 1972 in Richmond, California) is an American musician, songwriter, record producer, photographer, and videographer. He is best known as the trumpet and keyboardist in the band No Doubt. He has toured with acts like Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins, and Steel Pulse. == Early life == Bradley was born in Oakland, CA. Growing up in Richmond, CA, Bradley was first exposed to music by his mother Janice, and his Uncle Jerley. She played piano in the house, and encouraged Stephen to practice the Trumpet, when he took it up at age 13. Bradley continued to become more serious about music at El Cerrito High School, playing in the Jazz Ensemble, and the Symphonic Band. == Career == === Early beginnings, club days === During high school, Bradley performed with fellow high school friends in a band called Private Culture. Modeled after The Police, they played local Bay Area clubs in the late 80's early 90's. On one of these shows, they opened for No Doubt in Berkeley, California. Thats was the first time Bradley was introduced to the band. Bradley would go on to play with another Bay Area band called Dizzybam, which was a funk/rock/rap band from Oakland, CA. Bradley would be re-introduced to No Doubt by Dizzybam bassist and co-founder Kerry James. James and Tony Kanal (No Doubt) were friends, and Kanal reached out to James about finding a trumpet player to fill in for a Bay Area show at The Great American Music Hall (San Francisco). Bradley preformed the show, and was later asked to go on the road with No Doubt to play a leg of the inaugural 'Warped Tour. Bradley would go on to tour and record with No Doubt until the band discontinued in 2015. === Branching out === During the time with No Doubt, Bradley also pursued songwriting, and producing. Teaming up with long time friend and multi-instrumentalist David tweedie,the two created the self- titled album Chocolate O'Brian. That experience led to Bradley branching out as a producer, and songwriter. === Solo work === After living exclusively in the bay area,Bradley relocated to Los Angeles to seek more opportunities in the music business. In 2015, Bradley released his first solo single/video as a artist, with the release of 'Over and Out'. He later released an EP called 'Runaways', in which he teamed up with fellow songwriter and producer Javan Slagle. Runaways was received well by music critics, and Bradley coincided this with a solo residency at the Skybar in West Hollywood. In 2018, Bradley teamed up with Steel Pulse guitarist David Elecciri Jr. to record the reggae/pop album 'United We Stand', under the band name 'Valley of the Kings'. === Touring === In addition to touring with No Doubt, Bradley has toured with Green Day on their Nimrod tour in the early 2000's. He also toured with Smashing Pumpkins for their 20th anniversary tour. Bradley toured with Gwen Stefani on her 'Sweet Escape world tour', and is still performing with her currently. He is also a current touring member of Steel Pulse. === Photography/Videography === Bradley had also branched out into making music videos, and photography. == Discography == * A Very Special Christmas 3 (Various, 1997) * Return of Saturn (No Doubt, 2000) * Chocolate O'Brian (self- titled)2004 * Wikked Lil' Grrrls (Esthero, 2005) * The Sweet Escape (Gwen Stefani, 2006 * Push and Shove (No Doubt, 2012) * Sorry I'm Late (Cher Lloyd, 2014) * Over and out-single ( Stephen Bradley 2015) * Runaways-EP (Stephen Bradley 2015) * United We Stand (Valley Of The Kings 2018) * Mass Manipulation (Steel Pulse 2019) Category:American trumpeters Category:No Doubt members Category:Musicians from California Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Richmond, California",
