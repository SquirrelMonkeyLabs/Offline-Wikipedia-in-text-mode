 "text": "Numismatist John Allan suggested that Chandragupta defeated a Lichchhavi kingdom based in Vaishali and married Kumaradevi, a Lichchhavi princess, as part of a peace treaty. He believed the Guptas valued this marriage because of the Lichchhavis' ancient lineage. However, the Manusamhita, an ancient text, describes the Lichchhavis as \"unorthodox and impure,\" making it unlikely that the Guptas mentioned Samudragupta's Lichchhavi ancestry to enhance their social status. It is also unlikely that they would feature the Lichchhavis' name on their coins if they had defeated them. Instead, the marriage likely helped Chandragupta expand his political power and adopt the title Maharajadhiraja (Great King of Kings). The Lichchhavi name on Gupta coins may symbolize their role in strengthening Gupta rule. After the marriage, Chandragupta probably took control of Lichchhavi territories. Alternatively, the Gupta and Lichchhavi states may have formed a union, with Chandragupta and Kumaradevi ruling their respective regions until their son Samudragupta united the kingdoms under his sole rule. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:Gupta Empire Category:4th century",
