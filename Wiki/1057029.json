 "text": "The Transitional Military Council () was a military junta that ruled Sudan from 2019 to 2021. It took over the country after former President Omar al- Bashir was ousted in a coup d'état on 11 April 2019, and declared that it would take charge of the government of Sudan. It was first chaired by Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf, the former Minister for Defense of Sudan and also the former First Vice President of Sudan for a day from 11 to 12 April 2019 where Auf stepped down and gave the council to Abdel Fattah al-Burhan who was also the former First Vice President. On 20 August 2019, Burhan founded the Transitional Sovereignty Council who Burhan was also chaired but then his role in the new council was weaker than the TMC and thus the TSC took control over the TMC. On 25 October 2021, Burhan dissolved the TSC and the TMC after taking part in the 2021 Sudanese coup d'état and after the two councils was dissolved, Burhan immediately declared himself President. ==Members== The members of the TMC were: * Abdel Fattah al-Burhan (Chairman) * Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo (Deputy Chairman) * Malik Agar * Shams al-Din Khabbashi * Yasser al- Atta * Ibrahim Jabir Karim * El Hadi Idris Yahya * El Tahrir Abubakr Hajar * Raja Nicola * Abdulgasim Bortom * Yousef Jad Karim * Abdelbagi al-Zubeir * Salma Abdeljabbar == Related pages == * Military of Sudan * Omar al-Bashir * Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Category:21st century in Sudan",
