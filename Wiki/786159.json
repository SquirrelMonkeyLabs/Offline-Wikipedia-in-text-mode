 "text": "The Ten Little Indians is an American nursery rhyme. The term Indians in this sense refers to the Native Americans in the United States. The modern lyrics for this song are: ==Minstrel song== Songwriter Septimus Winner created an elaborated version of the children's song, called \"Ten Little Injuns\", in 1868 for a minstrel show. ==Books and songs== It is generally thought the song was adapted, possibly by Frank J. Green in 1869 as \"Ten Little Niggers\". It's also possible, however, that the influence was the other way around, with \"Ten Little Niggers\" being a close reflection of the text which then became \"Ten Little Indians\". Agatha Christie's book, And Then There Were None, was first called Ten Little Niggers and then Ten Little Indians. ===Criticism of the racist language=== Due to the use of racist words, modern versions for children usually use soldier boys or teddy bears as objects in the rhyme. ==References in popular culture== \"Ten Little Indians\" is a 1962 pop and rock- n-roll song from the Beach Boys. It's on their studio album Surfin' Safari. Several Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies short films used the song. In Tom Tom Tomcat, Tweety sings the song while writing down the number of Indian cats Granny has taken down so far. In England's Mickey Mouse Annual No. 6, the song was adapted into the comic 10 Little Mickey Kids. It told of little mouse babies who met their end until there were two left. ==References== Category:Children's songs Category:1860s songs",
