She became grand duchess on 14 January 1919 following the abdication of her sister, Marie-Adélaïde, due to political pressure. She married Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma on 6 November 1919. They had six children. Following the 1940 German invasion of Luxembourg during World War II, Charlotte went into exile: first in France, then Portugal, Great Britain, and North America. While in Britain, she made broadcasts to the people of Luxembourg. She returned to Luxembourg in April 1945. She abdicated in 1964, and was replaced by her son Jean. ==Other websites== * Charlotte's page on the official website of the Grand-Ducal House of Luxembourg Category:1896 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer Category:Grand Dukes of Luxembourg",
