In early 2019 many sources said that Messam would run for president to which he responded with \"all options will remain on the table.\" On March 13, 2019, he announced the formation of an exploratory committee for a possible run. He formally announced his candidacy on March 28, 2019. Messam launched his campaign at a rally at Florida Memorial University in Miami Gardens. Messam traveled to South Carolina, one of the early primary states in early March. He soon traveled to New Hampshire in May with further trips included South Carolina, Michigan, Nevada and California. Messam dropped out from the race on November 20, 2019 following low polling numbers, money raised and lack of qualification to any of the debates. ==References== ==Other websites== * Messam",
