 "text": "A sachet d'épices is a small cheesecloth sack containing herbs and spices. It is used to add flavor to stocks, soups and sauces. It means \"small bag of spices\" in French. It is often simply called a sachet. It is used like a bouquet garni, but a sachet's ingredients are inside a cheesecloth while a bouquet garni is not. This means that spices such as whole peppercorns and dried herbs, which cannot be used in a bouquet garni, can go in a sachet. Category:Cooking methods",
