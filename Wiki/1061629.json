 "text": "The WAGR Ma class were a total of 3 diesel-hydraulic locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1973 to 2014. The Ma class were built in 1972 by Walkers Limited of Maryborough, Queensland as an evolution of the M class. The Ma class had Caterpillar engines making them lighter as well as having multiple unit (MU) working capabilities. Two Ma class locos were sold to Colonial Sugar Refineries (CSR) in Queensland for spare parts in early 1994. No. 1862 managed to survive Westrail being sold off in 2000, being operated by the Western Australian Government Railways Commission (WAGRC) until 2003 when it became the ownership of Transperth who continued using the loco as shunter (pilot) at Claisebrook depot until 2014. The Hotham Valley Railway purchased the unit in 2015, it currently remains stored on their premises at Pinjarra. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
