This first meeting, which brought together a total of 28 participants, was preceded by a series of preparatory meetings held online in August 2021. The September 26 meeting ended with the signing of a joint declaration called “The New York Declaration” which is supposed to be the founding act of the Party. A steering committee and sectoral commissions have been set up to follow up on the decisions taken during this meeting. A three- day follow-up and consolidation workshop took place at the end of October 2021 in Florida during which the founding members of the Party notably discussed and adopted the Statutes and the declaration of principles of \"EDE\". ===Party Registration=== On November 25, 2021, the Political Party was officially registered with the Ministry of Justice and Public Security of the Republic of Haiti. On March 7, 2022, the Steering Committee requested the legal recognition of the Party from the Haitian State through the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. ===Legal Recognition=== On March 18, 2022, the EDE political party was formally and officially recognized by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security (MJSP).
