On 17 July 2014 the Boeing 777-200ER lost radar contact. The plane was shot down and crashed near the village of Hrabove, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. All 298 people (283 passengers and 15 crew members) aboard died. It was suspected by Ukraine that the aircraft was shot down by a ground-to-air missile, fired by Pro-Russian separatists during war in Donbas. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called it an \"act of terrorism.\" The investigation was carried out by the Dutch Safety Board. Fighting delayed investigation, but in October 2018 Dutch investigators said the plane was destroyed as a result of the explosion of a BUK missile. ==Gallery== Buk-m2 ky.jpg|A Buk-m2 MH17_map-en.svg|The flight path of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER PER Koch-2.jpg|The airplane involved in Perth, Australia in 2010 MH17 Missile Impact.webm|Video by the Dutch Safety Board showing the remodel of MH17 ==Notes== ==References== Category:2014 disasters Category:2014 in Europe Category:2010s disasters in Europe Category:2010s in Ukraine Category:2010s murders in Europe Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the 2010s Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Europe Category:Donetsk Oblast Category:July 2014 events Category:Murder in 2014",
