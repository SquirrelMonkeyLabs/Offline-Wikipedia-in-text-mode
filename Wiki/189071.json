 "text": "The British National Party (or BNP for short) is a far-right and fascist political party in the United Kingdom. The party was led by Nick Griffin from 1999, until 2014 and the current leader of the BNP is Adam Walker. In 2009, the party had 2 MEPs (Members of European Parliament) out of 73 British seats in the European Parliament. Those two seats were held by Griffin and Andrew Brons. It has no seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom or the devolved assemblies. The BNP was started in 1982, by John Tyndall (politician). In November 2012, the British Democratic Party was started by Brons. Brons started the party after leaving the BNP in October 2012. Brons wants the BDP to end the BNP. He does not like the BNP because he thinks its ideology is not extreme enough. Griffin lost his seat in the European Parliament in 2014. ==Related pages== * Extremism * Race (sociology) ==References== Category:1982 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Fascism Category:Nationalist organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Political parties in the United Kingdom",
