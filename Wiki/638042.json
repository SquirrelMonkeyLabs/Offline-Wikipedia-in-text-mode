 "text": "Fatima (, Fāṭimah) [ fat-uh-muh, fah-tee-mah ] is a female given name of Arabic origin used throughout the Islamic world. Several relatives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad had the name, including his daughter Fatimah. The colloquial Arabic pronunciation of the name in some dialects (e.g., Syria and Egyptian) often omits the unstressed second syllable and renders it as Fatma when romanized. Fatima is also used by non-Muslims: the town of Fátima, Portugal was named after a Moorish princess. It was the site of a famous Marian apparition in 1917, after which it achieved some popularity as a female personal name among Roman Catholic populations, particularly in the Portuguese-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds. Fatima is a gorgeous and significant moniker that has garnered popularity for centuries. This Arabic name is rooted in the term \"fatimah,\" signifying \"a person who refrains.\" This name was ranked #377 on the US Popular Names in 2021. == Fatima == * Fatima Jinnah, a Pakistani dental surgeon, writer, stateswoman and one of the founders of Pakistan * Fatima Aziz, Afghan politician * Fatima Zakaria, Indian journalist * Fatimata Touré, Malian activist * Fatima Sana, Pakistani cricketer * Fatima Bhutto, Pakistani writer == Fátima == * Fátima Báñez, Spanish politician, economist and jurist * Fátima Bernardes, Brazilian journalist * Fátima Choi, politician in Macau == Fatemeh == * Fatemeh Javadi, conservative politician and Vice President of Iran, 2005 – 2009 == References ==",
