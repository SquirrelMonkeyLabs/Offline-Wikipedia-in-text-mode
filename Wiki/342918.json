 "text": "The ANZ Championship is the most famous netball league in the world. The competition is held once a year between April and July. There are 69 matches played over 17 weeks. There are ten teams, five from Australia and five from New Zealand. ANZ Bank is the sponsor of the competition. The ANZ Championship was started in 2008. It replaced the Commonwealth Bank Trophy in Australia and the National Bank Cup in New Zealand. Both of which were retired after 2007. The ANZ Championship saw netball become a semi-professional sport in both countries. There was more media coverage and higher player salaries. The current champions are the Queensland Firebirds, who defeated the Northern Mystics in the grand final of the 2011 season. ==Current teams== Teams in the ANZ Championship Teams Bases Main venues Former teams Australia Adelaide Thunderbirds Adelaide ETSA Park Adelaide Thunderbirds Melbourne Vixens Melbourne State Netball and Hockey Centre Melbourne Phoenix, Melbourne Kestrels New South Wales Swifts Sydney Sydney Olympic Park Sports Centre Sydney Swifts, Hunter Jaegers Queensland Firebirds Brisbane Brisbane Convention Centre Queensland Firebirds West Coast Fever Perth Challenge Stadium Perth Orioles New Zealand Canterbury Tactix Christchurch CBS Canterbury Arena Canterbury Flames Central Pulse Wellington TSB Bank Arena Capital Shakers, Western Flyers Northern Mystics Auckland Trusts Stadium Auckland Diamonds, Northern Force, CMTV Cometz Southern Steel Invercargill Stadium Southland Southern Sting, Otago Rebels Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic Hamilton Mystery Creek Events Centre Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic Category:Sport in Australia Category:Sports competitions in New Zealand Category:Sports leagues Category:Sports organisations of Australia Category:2008 establishments Category:Netball",
