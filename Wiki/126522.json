 "text": "Warner Music Group is a record label from New York City. It is one of the \"big three\" record labels; the others are Sony and Universal. It started as Warner Music Group in 2003, but several Time Warner companies had existed before then. Warner Music owns a few record labels, including Atlantic Records, Elektra Records, Parlophone Records, Roadrunner Records, Warner Bros. Records, and Reprise Records. ==Legal troubles with Youtube== In late 2008, Warner Music Group had big legal troubles with video site YouTube. They had wanted more money for the music videos they had on the site, but YouTube said no, and Warner Music Group took off all their music videos. In September 2009, both Warner Music Group and YouTube decided on a new amount of money. ==References== Category:American record labels Category:Companies based in New York City",
