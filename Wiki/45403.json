 "text": "Drama is a type of literature. A drama can be in the form of a novel, television show, movie, play or dance. Although drama is a Greek word meaning \"action\", most dramas focus more on the relationships between people than on the actions. Dramas usually have a serious feel to them. Drama is considered the opposite of comedy, but drama and comedy can be used at the same time. Drama is full of sensational action, dialogue, incidents etc. Shakespeare influenced the theatre industry by showing what could be done with plot and language.",
