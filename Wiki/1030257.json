 "text": "The Tayside Children's Sleep Questionnaire is a list of questions to help doctors find possible issues with a young child’s sleep. It helps to find out if there are problems staying asleep or falling asleep. The questions are answered by the child’s parents. The questions ask about when the child goes to sleep and if the child walks while sleeping. The list of questions was validated to make sure it really tells us about sleep issues. Some scientists have also used the list of questions to do research. == References == Category:Sleep disorders Category:Medical tests",
