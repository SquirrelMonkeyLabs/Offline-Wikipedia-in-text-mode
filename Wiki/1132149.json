 "text": "Games for Windows – Live or GFWL (Games for Windows – LIVE) is a digital distribution, social networking, and online gaming service for PC titles branded Games for Windows, introduced on May 29, 2007, that enables Windows PCs to connect to Microsoft 's Live Anywhere service. Designed for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7; still works on Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. The service was open to third-party developers, but they had to meet certain Technical Certification Requirements (TCRs), which included (but were not limited to): game ratings, total number of Gamerscore points, content, game profiles, and Live connectivity. Games for Windows – Live games also had to meet standard Games for Windows (games that do not have Live support) TCRs. The same developer support infrastructure is available as on Xbox 360. Assistance for developers is provided through Microsoft XNA Developer Connection. ==Localization== As of February 10, 2015 Games for Windows – Live is available in 42 countries/territories. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == References == == Other websites == * Games for Windows – Live .
