 "text": "The mountain spiny-chest frog (Alsodes montanus) is a frog. It lives in Chile. ==Home== People find this frog under stones near streams on mountains. This frog spends most of its time in the water. Scientists have seen the frog between 1300 and 2600 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in three protected places: Alto Huemules, Río Clarillo, and Río Los Cipreses National Reserve. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. In part of its home, people changed the places where the frog lives to make a place for skiing, so there are bad chemicals. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
