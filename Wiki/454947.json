Characterization and dynamics of the GJ 876 planetary system. Astronomy and Astrophysics 511: A21. It is the closest star known to be a multiplanetary system. As of 2011, four extrasolar planets have been found orbiting the star.Rivera, Eugenio J. et al. 2010. The Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey: a Uranus-mass fourth planet for GJ 876 in an extrasolar Laplace configuration. The Astrophysical Journal 719 (1): 890â€“899. It is the third closest known star to the Sun which has a planetary system, after Epsilon Eridani (10.5 ly) and Gliese 674 (14.8 ly). Two of the middle planets are in the system's habitable zone. However, they are giant planets thought to be like Jupiter. == References == Category:Red dwarfs Category:Aquarius (constellation)",
