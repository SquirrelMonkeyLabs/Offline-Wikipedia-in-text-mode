The magazine grew to a peak circulation of around 3 million. It has since dropped to about 500,000. It shows explicit views of the female genitalia, becoming one of the first major US-based magazines to do so. It is seen as a rival to the modest publications like Playboy.Kipnis (2001) pp.134-135 ==Notes== Category:1974 establishments in the United States Category:Pornographic movie studios Category:American monthly magazines",
