 "text": "Staten Island is one of the boroughs of New York City. Fewer than half a million people live there, the smallest population of any of the five boroughs. Three bridges connect Staten Island to New Jersey, and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge connects to Brooklyn. A passenger railroad runs along the south shore to the northeast end of the island, which is called Saint George. The borough has the same boundaries as the county Richmond County. The free Staten Island Ferry carries 21 million passengers each year the five miles (eight km) across New York Harbor between Saint George and Manhattan. Nine ferry boats provide the service which began in 1817. When England took control of New Netherland in the Second Anglo-Dutch War in the 17th century and split it into New York and New Jersey, Staten Island became part of New York. == References == == Other websites == * Staten Island Live * Staten Island -Citizendium Category:Islands of New York (state) Category:County seats in New York (state) Category:1661 establishments Category:1660s establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:17th-century establishments in New York",
