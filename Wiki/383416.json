 "text": "Hogarth's Servants is an oil painting by William Hogarth. It was painted between 1750 and 1755. It shows the faces of six of his servants. It measures 62 × 75 cm (24.4 × 29.5 in). It hangs in the Tate Gallery, London. The painting shows three men and three women, of different ages. Each person looks in a different direction. The three women all look young, not children but also not old. The men are different ages, from a boy (at the top center), to an adult man (at the bottom center), to an elderly man (at the top right). Ronald Paulson thinks the servants could be a coachman (coach driver), valet (helper), messenger, housekeeper (top housemaid), and two housemaids. The servants are shown in their normal look, in their normal clothes. The painting was painted with love and sensitivity, showing Hogarth's affection for his servants.
