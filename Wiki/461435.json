 "text": "Garrett Augustus Morgan, Sr. (March 4, 1877 - July 27, 1963) was an African- American inventor and community leader. He is known for his inventions which included a type of protective respiratory hood (or gas mask), a traffic signal, and a hair-straightening chemical. He is also known for a heroic rescue in 1916 in which he and three others used the safety hood device he'd developed to save workers trapped within a water intake tunnel, fifty feet beneath Lake Erie. He is also credited as the first African American in Cleveland, Ohio, to own an automobile. ==References== ==Other websites== *The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History - Waterworks Disasters *Images from Morgan's patents * Category:1877 births Category:1963 deaths Category:American inventors Category:Businesspeople from Kentucky",
