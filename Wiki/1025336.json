 "text": "When an electron is transferred from its ground state to other upper energy levels (called excited state of an electron) by providing heat enthalpy then the atom is said to be in excited state. An atom is not stable in its excited state. It needs to be in its ground state (which is also its energy level with highest magnitude) to be stable.
