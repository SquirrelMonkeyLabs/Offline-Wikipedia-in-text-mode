It was released in Japan on August 23, 2000, and in North America on April 11, 2001. It is a spin-off game in the Kirby series of video games. The player controls Kirby by moving the game console. The game comes with a built-in accelerometer to allow the player to do so. The object of the game is to guide Kirby to a level's goal within the time limit. To do so, the player tilts the console in the direction they wish to move Kirby. Kirby can jump if the player moves the console vertically in a jerking motion (moving the console forward quickly). The game involves the collection of stars that are in the level. Levels also have one secret star. The player has to collect all of the secret stars to fully complete the game. ==References== Category:2000 video games Category:Kirby Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Game Boy Color-only games Category:Marble video games Category:Nintendo Research & Development 2 games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
