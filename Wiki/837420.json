 "text": "Ceramic nanoparticle is a type of nanoparticle that is contained of ceramics, which are classified as inorganic, heat-resistant, nonmetallic solids that can be made of both metallic and nonmetallic compounds. == Properties == There are many properties of ceramic nanoparticles. Viz * Ferroelectric - these are dielectric materials that polarize in more than one direction that is negative and positive sides can be flipped via an electric field. *Piezoelectric - these are materials that carry an electrical charge under mechanical stress. *Dielectric - these are electric insulators that can be polarized by an electric field to shorten the distance of electron transfer in an electric current. == References == Category:Ceramics Category:Nanotechnology",
