 "text": "Jacques Brel (8 April 1929 – 9 October 1978) was a Belgian singer-songwriter. He was widely said to be a master of the modern chanson. Although he recorded most of his songs in French, he became a major influence on English-speaking songwriters and performers. Some of these were David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, and Rod McKuen. English translations of his songs were recorded by many top performers in the United States. These include Ray Charles, Judy Collins, John Denver, the Kingston Trio, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra, Scott Walker, and Andy Williams. In French-speaking countries, Brel was also a successful actor, appearing in ten movies. He also directed two movies. Le Far West was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973. Brel died of lung cancer. He has sold over 25 million records worldwide. He is the third best-selling Belgian recording artist of all time. ==Discography== === Studio albums === * Grand Jacques (1954) * Quand On n'a Que l'Amour (1957) * Au Printemps (1958) * La Valse à Mille Temps (1959) * Marieke (1961) * Les Bourgeois (1962) * Les Bonbons (1966) * Ces Gens-Là (1966) * Jacques Brel 67 (1967) * J'arrive (1968) * L'Homme de la Mancha (1968) * Ne Me Quitte Pas (1972) * Les Marquises (1977) === Live albums === * Enregistrement Public à l'Olympia 1961 (1962) * Enregistrement Public à l'Olympia 1964 (1964) === Boxed sets, compilations, and rarities === * Boîte à Bonbons (2003) * Infiniment (2003) * Chansons ou Versions Inédites de Jeunesse (2003) == Filmography == === As actor === * La grande peur de Monsieur Clément (short) (dir Paul Deliens) (1956) * Les risques du métier (dir André Cayatte) (1967) * La Bande à Bonnot (dir Philippe Fourastié) (1968) * Mon oncle Benjamin (dir Édouard Molinaro) (1969) * Mont-Dragon (dir Jean Valère) (1970) * Franz (dir Jacques Brel) (1971) * Les assassins de l'ordre (dir Marcel Carné) (1971) * L'aventure, c'est l'aventure (dir Claude Lelouch) (1972) * Le bar de la fourche (dir Alain Levent) (1972) * Le Far West (dir Jacques Brel) (1973) * L'emmerdeur (dir Édouard Molinaro) (1973) === As director === * Franz (1971) * Le Far West (1973) === As writer === * La grande peur de Monsieur Clément (short) (1956) * Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris (play) (1968) * Franz (1971) * Le Far West (1973) === As self === * Petit jour (short) (1960) * Zeg hé, spaar je mee?
