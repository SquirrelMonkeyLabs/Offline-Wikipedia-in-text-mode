The high dam is a concrete buttress which holds back the River Haddeo. It has a water storage capacity of 21,000 megalitres over . At times of low flow in the River Exe, water is released into the river for taking out downstream at Tiverton and Exeter. The effects of this regulation of the water flow from the lake have been studied. The area near the lake is a recreation and sports area. The Outdoor + Active Centre is open for tuition in various watersports activities including sailing, windsurfing, canoeing and rowing. Visitors can also launch their own craft or hire from the centre. The cycle route takes you around the lake, following mostly bridleways and some quiet country lanes. The route passes through woodland and grassland, with glimpses of the lake. == References == Category:Lakes of the United Kingdom",
