At the age of 17, Welch became anorexic, which she wrote about in her 2018 song \"Hunger\". == Career == As a teenager she was the frontwoman for the bands Toxic Cockroaches and Ashok, though she did not stay in either band for long. Around this time, Welch met Isabella Summers. They became friends and formed a band with the name as a practical joke: Florence and the Machine (formally styled Florence + the Machine), as Summers and Welch had nicknamed each other \"Isa Machine\" and \"Florence Robot\".
