 "text": "A pandit (Sanskrit: पण्डितः, Hindi: पंडित) is a person with special knowledge, mainly in Hinduism, who teaches subjects like Vedic scriptures, Hindu law, and philosophy. In the past, the word was used for Hindu law experts, but today it can also mean an expert in fields like music. In English, the word pundit comes from pandit and refers to someone who gives expert opinions, especially in politics, science, technology, or sports. For Muslim men in music, the similar title is ustad (उस्ताद). The words Vidushi (विदूषी), Pandita (पंडिता), and Panditain (पंडिताइन) are titles for Hindu women, though they are not widely used today.
