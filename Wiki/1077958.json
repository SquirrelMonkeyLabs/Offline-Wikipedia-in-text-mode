 "text": "The Gibraltar Anthem is the national anthem of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar which is located in Iberian peninsula. ==Lyrics== Gibraltar, Gibraltar, the rock on which I stand, May you be forever free, Gibraltar, my own land. Mighty pillar, rock of splendour, guardian of the sea, Port of hope in times of need, rich in history. Gibraltar, Gibraltar, the rock on which I stand, May you be forever free, Gibraltar my own land. God give grace to this our homeland, help us to live as one, Strong in freedom, truth and justice, let this be our song: Gibraltar, Gibraltar, the rock on which I stand, May you be forever free, Gibraltar! Gibraltar! My own land. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:European anthems Category:Gibraltar",
