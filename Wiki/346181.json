Stuart had announced changes for Barbados including his intention to turn Barbados into a republic and replace the Queen of Barbados with a ceremonial President as Head of state. On 22 March 2015, Stuart told a meeting of his Democratic Labour Party (Barbados): “We cannot pat ourselves on the shoulder at having gone into independence; having decolonized our Politics; we cannot pat ourselves on the shoulders at having decolonised our jurisprudence by delinking from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and explain to anybody why we continue to have a monarchical system. Therefore, the Right Excellent Errol Barrow decolonized the Politics; Owen Arthur decolonized the jurisprudence and Freundel Stuart is going to complete the process. The general secretary of the Democratic Labour Party, George Pilgrim, confirmed the move and said that it is expected to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Barbadian independence in 2016. According to Pilgrim, the change will be implemented through a bill that will be presented to the Parliament of Barbados. According to the country’s Constitution, a two- third majority in Parliament, both in the House of Assembly of Barbados and the Senate of Barbados must have a two-third of the ruling party. In the event that Barbados becomes a republic, it will still retain its membership of the Commonwealth of Nations but the Queen of Barbados will be replaced in her presence with a ceremonial President as head of state. The position of Governor-General of Barbados will also be dissolved. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Prime ministers of Barbados Category:Living people Category:University of the West Indies alumni",
