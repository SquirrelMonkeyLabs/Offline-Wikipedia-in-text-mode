 "text": "Footprint Center is an multi-use arena located in Phoenix, Arizona that serves as the home for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Phoenix Mercury of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). The arena was also the home of the Phoenix Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1996 until 2003. They first started to build the stadium on August 1, 1990. The arena opened on June 6, 1992 and the first event was a concert by country singer George Strait. The Suns had their first game in the arena on November 7, 1992. In their first game, they defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 111–105. The Coyotes had their first game at the arena on October 10, 1996. They would defeat the San Jose Sharks by a score of 4–1. The Coyotes would play their last game in the arena in a 5–2 defeat to the Minnesota Wild on December 15, 2003. They would move to Glendale Arena in Glendale to play halfway through the 2003–04 NHL season. In January 1990, sponsorship naming rights were bought by America West Airlines and the arena was named America West Arena. After America West bought and took over US Airways, they decided to change the name of the arena to US Airways Center. On December 2, 2014, the naming rights were sold to Talking Stick Resort, a luxury hotel and casino resort. The arena was then renamed Talking Stick Resort Arena. The naming rights expired on November 6, 2020. This left the arena without a sponsor and it would be renamed to PHX Arena and later Phoenix Suns Arena. On July 16, 2021, materials science company Footprint purchased naming rights for the arena and renamed it to the Footprint Center. WWE has hosted many shows and pay-per-views at the arena including SummerSlam in 2003, Judgment Day in 2006, Cyber Sunday in 2008, Money in the Bank in 2012, Elimination Chamber in 2017, and NXT TakeOver: Phoenix. All Elite Wrestling (AEW) have also hosted episodes of their weekly television shows Dynamite and Rampage at the arena. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Buildings and structures in Arizona",
