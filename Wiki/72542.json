 "text": "The Kingdom of Poland of the Jagiellons lasted from 1385 to 1569. It was created by the accession of Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, to the Polish throne in 1386. The Union of Krewo united Poland and Lithuania into one monarchy. The union was confirmed but also transformed into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Union of Lublin in 1569. This was shortly followed by the end of the Jagiellon dynasty that had ruled Poland for two centuries. ==Related pages== * History of Poland Category:History of Poland",
