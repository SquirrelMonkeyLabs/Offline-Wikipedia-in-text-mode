It lasted from 1834 to 1870 and was about who had control over Bolama Island and a small nearby area.António dos Mártires Lopes, A questão de Bolama: pendência entre Portugal e Inglaterra. Agência-Geral do Ultramar, Lisbon, 1970. == History == The conflict began in 1792 when a group of British settlers tried to create a colony on Bolama Island.Philip Beaver, African Memoranda Relative to an Attempt to establish a British Settlement on the Island of Bolama in the year 1792. London, 1805. The colony did not last, but starting in 1834, the United Kingdom claimed the island again while working to stop the Atlantic slave trade. The conflict was decided in 1870 by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant, who ruled in favor of Portugal. This decision made Bolama officially part of Portuguese Guinea, now Guinea-Bissau.
