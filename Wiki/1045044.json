 "text": "The Jamaica women's national football team, known as the \"Reggae Girlz\" is the women's national football team of Jamaica. They play football against other countries. Jamaica is one of the best teams in the Caribbean, like Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti. Back in 2008, the team stopped playing together because they didn't do well in the Olympic Qualifying tournament, where they had to compete against the United States and Mexico. But in 2014, they started playing again after taking a break for about six years. They did pretty well in the 2014 Women's Caribbean Cup, but unfortunately, they lost to Trinidad and Tobago in the final match and came in second place. Cedella Marley, who is Bob Marley's daughter, supports the team to get attention, grow, and gives them money. In 2019, Jamaica made it to the FIFA Women's World Cup for the first time. But they didn't do well and lost all their games in the first round. In the 2023 World Cup, Jamaica did better. They reached the Round of 16 for the first time. They didn't allow France and Brazil score any goals in their games, and they won their first-ever World Cup game against Panama 1â€“0. ==References== Category:North American women's national association football teams Category:Football in Jamaica Category:National sports teams of Jamaica",
