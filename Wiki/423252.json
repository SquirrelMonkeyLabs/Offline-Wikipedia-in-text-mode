 "text": "A topographic map is a kind of map which uses contour lines or other ways to show elevation and topography. These maps are often very detailed, with a scale. Topographical maps may be used for many purposes. They show relief features, rivers, land use, vegetation, settlements, roads, railway lines and administrative units and boundaries. These maps are revised periodically to update them. Town guide maps are based on them. == Conventional signs and symbols == Features seen on the ground are shown with the help of symbols on the topographic maps. These are only symbols of Earth's features and are not drawn according to any specific scale. These conventional signs help in giving information and adding legibility to the map.
