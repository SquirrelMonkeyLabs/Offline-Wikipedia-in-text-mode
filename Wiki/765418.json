 "text": "The Italian alphabet is the same as the English alphabet, but without the letters J, K, W, X or Y. These letters, however, still occur in words borrowed from other languages. The letter J does occur in some words in certain accents of the Italian language, but it is no longer included in the Italian alphabet as of the early 20th century. The letter H mostly occurs after letters C or G in Italian. This is because in Italian, the letter C before E or I makes a soft sound, and the letter G before E or I also makes a soft sound. To preserve the hard sound, you must add an H after C or G. The Italian Alphabet is as follows: A B C D E F G H I L M N O P Q R S T U V Z Category:Italian language Category:Latin alphabet",
