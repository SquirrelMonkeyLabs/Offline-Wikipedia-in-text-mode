 "text": "The Onondaga people are part of the Iroquois confederacy and although they have been joined with its 5 other tribes they do speak their own language. Although Onondaga is dwindling it is still used in the government of the Onondaga Nation with all presented laws being in the language and with the chiefs' titles also being in the language. Because the Onondaga are part of the Iroquois confederacy it is quite similar to the other languages from other tribes in the confederacy. ==References== Category:Languages of North America",
