 "text": "The 1992 United States presidential election happened on November 3, 1992. Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate and Governor of Arkansas, won the election. He defeated the incumbent president, George H. W. Bush, who was a Republican, and Ross Perot, an independent candidate. Clinton got 370 electoral votes, Bush got 168, and Perot got 0. A person running for president needs to get 270 to win. George H.W. Bush may have lost the election for several reasons. He broke his promise of \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" by increasing taxes during his term. Some of his most well-known accomplishments during his presidency came from his foreign policy, and because of the Cold War and Gulf War being over, foreign policy became a smaller issue, as the economy became a bigger issue, since the economy was bad. Prior to 2020, this was the last election where a candidate won the presidency without winning Florida. ==Candidates== ===Republican Party=== Republican candidates *George H. W.
