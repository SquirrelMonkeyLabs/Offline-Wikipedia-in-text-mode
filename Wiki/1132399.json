 "text": "The Wenvoe transmitting station, officially called Arqiva Wenvoe is a television, radio and telecommunications transmitter. It is close to the welsh village of Wenvoe in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. The site is owned and managed by Arqiva. The site is estimated to serve 630 thousand homes. It was the first television transmitter in Wales. == History == The original 230 meters tall mast in the site was built in 1952 by the BBC. It originally only carried BBC One on 405-line VHF television. It used to broadcast on Band I channel 5. From the 15 August 1952 it used its reserve transmitters, until the 20 December 1952 when the main transmitter was started. The original mast was used until 1985, with the closure of 405-line television. In 1955 FM radio started broadcasting from the transmitter, with the BBC Home Service. The BBC Light Programme was added in 1956 and the Third Programme was added in 1959. In 1963 a second, shorter 191 m mast was built next to the original structure. It was made to carry the new BBC Wales 405-line service on Band III channel 13. It began broadcasting on 9 February 1964.http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1964-29.pdf The transmitter used for this service closed in 1983. On 12 September 1965, a 625-line black and white television service BBC2 started transmitting from Wenvoe on UHF. The transmitter used was able to broadcast in colour from the beginning and was used for unannounced colour test transmissions from that point on. In September 1967, BBC2 officially started a colour TV service from Wenvoe. This was a few months after BBC2 Crystal Palace and others started the first regular colour TV service in the UK in July. In 1970, the 625-line colour television was introduced for BBC1 and HTV Wales (ITV). S4C was added in 1982 when it began broadcasting. In 1985, after the end of 405-line television in the United Kingdom, the site was redone. This involved the removal of the two original masts. They were replaced by a new mast (which became known as Wenvoe \"A\"), which remains at the site to this day. Wenvoe \"B\" is a telecommunications mast that is placed nearby. The FM radio antennas were upgraded from the old horizontally polarised antennas to new mixed polarisation antennas. The transmitter power was also doubled. Channel 5 launched in 1997, but was transmitted from Mendip instead of Wenvoe. It was assumed that the transmitter at Mendip would serve a good number of houses in Wenvoe's area. At the time, many houses that could receive Mendip were already pointing at it, instead of Wenvoe. Work started on a new temporary mast that was 217.7 metres tall (called Wenoe \"C\") on 14 June 2006. The construction was finished in September 2006. This carried analogue signals while Wenvoe \"A\" was being improved and extended by 23 metres. Wenvoe \"A\" was given a new high- power digital antenna and a reserve antenna. New high-power digital TV transmitters were put in the buildings, which allows Wenvoe \"A\" to broadcast the six main digital TV multiplexes and a seventh multiplex proposed by OFCOM after analogue television signals ended in 2010. The upgrade to Wenvoe \"A\" was completed in the summer of 2009 and Wenvoe \"C\" was removed starting in late August 2009. Wenvoe's analogue BBC Two service was turned off on 3 March 2010. The other analogue TV services closed on 31 March 2010, marking the point where Wales had officially finished digital switchover.\"Wales is first UK nation to switch fully to digital TV\" == Services listed by frequency == === Analogue television === ==== 15 August 1952 - 9 February 1964 ==== Frequency VHF kW Service 66.75 MHz 5V 100 BBC Television ==== 9 February 1964 - 12 September 1965 ==== The second mast began service and carried the BBC Wales service.
