 "text": "In typography and typesetting, color refers to the apparent darkness or density of a region of text, considered in the context of the printed (or handwritten) page. For example, a region of text may be said to be too dark or too light, or the color may be described as inconsistent. The same concept is used in type design, wherein the designer may seek to achieve \"even color\"â€”that is, to create the optical impression of roughly uniform density or blackness within specimens of text set in that typeface.
