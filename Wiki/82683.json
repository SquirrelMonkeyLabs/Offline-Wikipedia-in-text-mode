It is part of a larger complex, a bishop's palace. It was built as a replacement for an earlier church which dated from the Merovingian era. It was here that Harold Godwinson swore an oath that later led to the Norman Conquest. ==Other websites== *Les Amis de Cathedrale de Bayeux ==Gallery== Image:Bayeux Historic Centre.jpg|Towers over town Image:Notre Dame de Bayeux.jpg|Cathedral hall interior Image:Bayeux_cathedrale_Notre- Dame_crypte.jpg|Crypt under the cathedral Image:Bayeauxcathedralinterior.jpg|An inside view of the cathedral Image:Baycript.jpg|A mural in the crypt Image:Baycrypt.jpg|Another such mural ==References== Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals Category:Cathedrals in France Category:Calvados Category:11th-century buildings and structures",
