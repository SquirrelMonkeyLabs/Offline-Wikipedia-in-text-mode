 "text": "The Legislative Assembly is the Parliament of Samoa based in the capital, Apia, where the country's central administration is located. In the Samoan language, the Legislative Assembly of Samoa is sometimes known as the Samoan Fono while the government of the country is known as the Malo. Samoan Fono had 49 Members of Parliament. These were elected in six two-seat and 35 single- seat constituencies. Of these 49 seats, 47 were legally reserved for traditional heads of families (matai) and two for special constituencies: These two seats were first reserved for Samoan citizens from non-Samoan descent and elected on a non-territorial basis. ==References== Category:Politics of Samoa",
