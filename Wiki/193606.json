The data is stored on many machines. Freenet was made by Ian Clarke. Freenet has a goal to provide freedom of speech and Freedom of information through a peer-to-peer network with protection of user's identity. Freenet works by putting together the volunteer bandwidth and storage space of member machines to allow users to anonymously publish (place or upload) or retrieve (get or download) different kinds of information. From a user's perspective, it can be thought of as simply a large storage device. Freenet has been under continuous development since 2000; a version 1.0 has not yet been released but current builds are usable. The project has already seen a ground-up rewrite (redoing of programming) for version 0.7. Freenet is free software. ==Related pages== * Anonymous P2P * Crypto-anarchism * Cypherpunk * distributed file system * Entropy (anonymous data store) * Freedom of information * Friend-to-friend * GNUnet * I2P * Osiris sps * Tor (anonymity network) * Share - the successor to Winny * Perfect Dark - the successor to Share; it employs many of Freenet's principles. ==References== Category:Free software Category:Networks",
