 "text": "A meteorite strewnfield is the area where meteorites and glassy tektites from a single meteor fall are found.French, Bevan M 1998. Traces of Catastrophe: a handbook of shock-metamorphic effects in terrestrial meteorite impact structures. LPI Contribution No. 954. Houston: Lunar and Planetary Institute. ==Formation== There are two ways for strewnfields to form: # Mid-air fragmentation. When a large meteor enters the atmosphere it often fragments into many pieces. This showers the material over a large oval-shaped area. The shape of this oval is caused by the flight path of the meteor. When multiple- explosions occur, the material may be found in several overlapping ovals. # Impact fragmentation: the fragmentation can occur on impact. In this case the strewnfield shape may be different, usually circular. == Example == * The Australasian strewnfield is the youngest and largest of the tektite strewnfields. Recent estimates suggest it may cover 10%-30% of the Earth's surface.Povenmire H; Liu W. & Xianlin I. 1999. Australasian tektites found in Guangxi Province, China. 30th Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Houston. ==References== Category:Meteorites",
