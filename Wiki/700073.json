 "text": "On June 13, 2019, two oil tankers were attacked near the Strait of Hormuz while transiting the Gulf of Oman. The Japanese Kokuka Courageous and Norwegian Front Altair were attacked with limpet mines or flying objects, causing fire damage to both ships. American and Iranian military personnel responded to the attacks and were involved in rescuing crew members from the ships. The attacks took place a month after a similar incident and on the same day that Ayatollah Khamenei met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe in Iran. Amid tensions between Iran and the United States, the United States blamed Iran for the attacks. Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom supported the United States' accusation, while Japan and Germany want more proof of Iran's culpability. Iran denied the accusation, blaming the United States for spreading wrong information. The cause is currently under investigation. Another similar incident occurred in 2021. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2019 in Asia Category:2010s in Iran Category:June 2019 events Category:History of Oman Category:Disasters in Iran Category:Maritime disasters Category:2019 disasters in Asia",
