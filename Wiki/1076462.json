 "text": "Bovril is the trademarked name of a thick and salty meat extract paste, similar to a yeast extract, developed in the 1870s by John Lawson Johnston. It is sold in a distinctive bulbous jar and as cubes and granules. Bovril is owned and distributed by Unilever UK. It looks and tastes like British Marmite and its Australian equivalent Vegemite but it is not vegetarian. Bovril can be made into a drink (referred to in the UK as a \"beef tea\") by diluting with hot water or, less commonly, with milk. It can be used as a flavouring for soups, broth, stews or porridge, or as a spread, especially on toast in a similar fashion to Marmite and Vegemite. ==References== Category:British food Category:Drinks",
