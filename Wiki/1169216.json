 "text": "Hermina's poison frog (Mannophryne herminae) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near narrow streams in forests on mountains that have lower lands around them. This frog can live in forests that are growing back and in forests that were never cut down. They can also live on big coffee farms and big cocoa farms. Scientists have seen the frog between 0 and 1200 meters above sea level. There are two national parks in the place where the frog lives San Esteban National Park and Henri Pittier National Park. ==Young== The male frogs sit on rocks and call to the female frogs. The female frogs sometimes fight each other. The female frogs lay eggs in the dead leaves on the ground near streams. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to ponds in the streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings start fires, change forests to make farms and towns, and visit the forest in ways that can hurt the frog. The government of Venezuela does not always make people follow the law. Scientists found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other animals in the frog's home, but they did not find any on Mannophyrne herminae. They think the frog might not die from the disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
