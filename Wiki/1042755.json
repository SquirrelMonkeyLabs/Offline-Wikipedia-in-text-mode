 "text": "The Munnar bush frog (Raorchestes munnarensis) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in Devikulam and Munnar in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1400 and 2000 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in only a small place, and people are still changing it in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. For example, people build farms to grow tea and eucalyptus. People might hit this frog with cars. Climate change might also kill this frog. This frog's home includes two protected parks: Eravikulam National Park and Anamalai Tiger Reserve. Scientists think about half the frogs live in these two places. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Raorchestes, so they think it could make R. munnarensis sick too. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
