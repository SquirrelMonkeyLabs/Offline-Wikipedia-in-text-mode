 "text": "The Utah Mammoth is an American professional ice hockey team that began playing in 2024 as Utah Hockey Club. The team plays in the Central Division of the National Hockey League (NHL). They play their home games in Salt Lake City, Utah at the Delta Center. ==History== On April 13, 2024, there were reports that the NHL was in talks to move the Arizona Coyotes to Salt Lake City. The team would be bought and then sold for $1.2 billion to Ryan Smith, the owner of the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). On April 18, 2024, Salt Lake City was officially granted an expansion franchise by the National Hockey League Board of Governors. The team would take over the Arizona Coyotes, who went inactive because they were unable to build a proper NHL arena. If Arizona is able to build a new arena by 2029 then it will rejoin the NHL as an expansion team with all previous team history, records and uniforms being transferred to the team. The Utah team announced on June 13, 2024 that it would be known as Utah Hockey Club (Utah HC for short) in the 2024â€“25 season. One round of fan voting on a more permanent name had already taken place, with six finalists announced on June 6. In addition to Utah HC, finalists are Blizzard, Mammoth, Outlaws, Venom, and Yeti, with a second round of polling having started at that time. On May 7, 2025, the team's permanent name was announced as Utah Mammoth. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2024 establishments in the United States Category:National Hockey League teams Category:Salt Lake City",
