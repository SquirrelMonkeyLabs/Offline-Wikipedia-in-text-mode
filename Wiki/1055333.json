 "text": "The Tiffanie is a breed of cat. It is a cross breed between the burmese and the Persian chinchilla. It is also called the Asian semi-longhair. == History == In the 1980s in Great Britain, there was a breeding program that crossed the burmese with the Persian chinchilla. Thus, long-haired burmilla kittens were born. Initially Tiffanies were not considered important by cat breeders, because they lacked the desirable characteristics of the burmilla breed. But a small group of cat breeders tried to develop the Tiffanie. Later, their efforts were successful, and the breed became popular. In 1991, the Tiffanie was recognized by GCCF with preliminary status. In 1999, its status changed to under observation. Then finally, tiffanie changed its status again to \"Championship\". == Characteristics == Tiffanie is a medium-bodied cat with a smooth, soft coat and long hair around the neck and a thick, fluffy tail. The body shape of this cat breed is similar to the burmese and Persian chinchilla. == References == == Other websites == *Asian Semi-longhair Description *FBRL Breed Page: Asian *Asian Cat Association *Asian Group Cat Society Category:Cat breeds",
