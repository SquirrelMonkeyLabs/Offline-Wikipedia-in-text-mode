 "text": "Anthony Donald Joseph Field, AM (born May 8, 1963) is an Australian musician, actor, songwriter and producer. He is best known as a member of the children's group The Wiggles and the 1980s and 1990s pop band The Cockroaches. While still a teenager, he helped found The Cockroaches with his brothers, Paul and John. The Cockroaches recorded two albums and enjoyed moderate success, interrupted by Field's service in Australia's regular army, until they disbanded in the late 1980s. Field attended Macquarie University to receive training in early childhood education. He founded The Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles became one of the most successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wears blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well- documented. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:1963 births Category:Australian drummers Category:Australian rock singers Category:Australian Roman Catholics Category:Musicians from Sydney Category:Bass guitarists Category:Violinists Category:Keyboardists Category:Multi-instrumentalists Category:Rock guitarists Category:Living people Category:Order of Australia",
