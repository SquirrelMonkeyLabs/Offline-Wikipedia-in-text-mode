This special orbit is beyond the moon, at the second Lagrange point (L2) of the Sun-Earth system, this orbit is 1,500,000 kilometers from Earth, about four times farther away from Earth than the moon. It does not actually go around the Earth, but goes around the sun at the same speed as the Earth. == The mission == The main goal of Euclid is to study the universe, learn it's history, and learn the expansion of the universe. With it's 600 megapixel camera the telescope can take high-resolution images of galaxies millions of light-years away. ESA released the first colorful images from the Euclid telescope on November, 7 2023 == Gallery == File:Euclid’s new image of spiral galaxy NGC 6744 ESA497254.jpg|Euclid's view of the spiral galaxy NGC 6744 File:Euclid’s view of the Horsehead Nebula ESA25170866.jpg|Euclid's view of the Horsehead Nebula.
