The song peaked at number eight on the US Hot Latin Tracks. \"Baila Esta Cumbia\" () was the lead single from Ven Conmigo (1990). The song peaked at number 20 on the Hot Latin Tracks. The song \"Buenos Amigos\" () was a duet with Salvadoran singer Alvaro Torres. The song peaked at number-one on the Hot Latin Tracks. It became Selena's and Torres' first number-one single.
