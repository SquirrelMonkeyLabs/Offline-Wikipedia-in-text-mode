 "text": "Among other similar vessels, the Felucca Plutón was a very notable boat for its performance. DCVB:Falutx Built in Arenys de Mar, she was of the type \"elastic felucca \". She used to navigate as a coast guard (\"maritime guard\") based in Benidorm. == Nautical features == The performances of the Plutón, from a nautical point of view, were highlighted by Lieutenant Pedro Riudavets. This expert Menorcan navigator translated a treatise on sail construction ( Sails and Sailmaking by Robert Kipping), adding many aspects about lateen sails that were not included in the original: Elements of sail construction. Regarding the Plutón, Riudavets stated that it was one of the best feluccas built on the Catalan coast; He even indicated the proportions of the hull and rig that allowed such outstanding results. Basically good speed and great upwind ability (close-hauled angle: 4.5 quarters). Riudavets' dedication and interest in \"maritime safety\" vessels seems demonstrated by his donation of three models to the Naval Museum. == Dimensions == The Plutón was 21.06 meters long and 6.4 meters wide. == Professional tasks == The handling of the Plutón as a customs ship was carried out by a company from Benidorm, Ors y García, founded in 1835 under the orders of Gaspar Ortuño. In 1844 the Plutón belonged to the Spanish Navy. == Comparison with actual feluccas == In the 19th and 20th centuries there were two types of feluccas: utilitarian feluccas (intended for ordinary transport) and fast feluccas called elastics (intended for coast guard functions, privateering, smuggling and important transport). The elastic feluccas had finer lines, greater sail area and more slender sail shapes. The following images show two felucca-rigged boats still underway. Regarding the shapes and rigging, they could be considered utilitarian feluccas. Plutón was 21 meters long.
