 "text": "Godzilla is a luminous blue variable star located in the Sunburst Galaxy, Godzilla is one of the most extreme stars out there due to its extremely high luminosity. Godzilla has a redshift of z = 2.37.It was first seen by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). As of October 2022, it is the most luminous star that can be currently observed. It is also 10.9 billion light years away from Earth, also making it one of the most distant stars. Godzilla is located in the constellation of Apus. == Luminosity == As of September 2024, Godzilla is still the most luminous star with a luminosity of 134-255 million solar luminosities. Godzilla is probably experiencing an event similar to the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae A, in the next couple of years or months Godzilla will eventually shed its outer layers and leave the LBV eruption. == Distance == The extreme magnification of Godzilla is because of a nearby structure, most likely a dwarf galaxy mainly compromised of dark matter. Godzilla is over 10.9 billion light years away from Earth, making it the fifth most distant known star. Godzilla is a Kaiju star named after the most infamous Kaiju, another Kaiju star is EMO J041608.838-240358.60, or Mothra, which is a binary system. == Other physical characteristics == Godzilla is one of the largest stars in the universe, and one of the largest luminous blue variables. Godzilla is very big. It is 430-2,365 solar radii (2-11 AU). Godzilla has a temperature of 15,000-30,000 kelvins (30,000 kelvins, 2 AU, 15,000 kelvins, 11 AU) Godzilla is also one of the most massive stars in the universe with a mass of over 106 solar masses, after Godzilla leaves the luminous blue variable stage, it will evolve into a stellar-mass black hole. == References == Category:Stars Category:Hypergiants",
