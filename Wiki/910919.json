 "text": "Delaware Colony was a North American colony. It was in land on the bank of the Delaware River Bay. People settled to here in the 1600s. The first people here were Lenape and possibly the Assateague tribes of Native Americans. The first European settlers were Swedes. In the 1700s, Delaware Colony's English colonists were mostly quaker. The Lower Counties of Delaware were governed from Pennsylvania from 1682 until 1701. The Lower Counties then petitioned to become a colony. This made the two colonies independent. They had the same governor until 1776. At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, the colonies decided to create the state of Delaware. ==Sources== * Johnson, Amandus.
