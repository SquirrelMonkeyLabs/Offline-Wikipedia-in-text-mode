He helped Fletcher Christian seize the ship's chest of arms and was among the group who arrested Bligh in his cabin. Almost nothing is known about the early life of Adams. An article from the Mona's Herald, dated April 1876, states that Adams had, for some time, resided in Douglas, Isle of Man.Mona's Herald, Thursday, April 27, 1876; Page: 11 When the American ship Topaz arrived at Pitcairn in 1808, the ship's captain found Adams ruling over a peaceful community of ten Tahitian women (including his wife) and several children. His children used the surname \"Adams\". The main settlement and capital of Pitcairn, Adamstown, is named after Adams. Adams' grave on Pitcairn is the only known grave site of a Bounty mutineer. It has a replacement headstone, the original lead-covered wooden grave marker having been taken back to Britain where it is now on display in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. Adams was the third ruler of of the Pitcairn Islands. == References == Category:English emigrants to the Pitcairn Islands Category:Pitcairn Islands politicians Category:Royal Navy sailors Category:1767 births Category:1829 deaths Category:18th-century pirates Category:HMS Bounty mutineers Category:Pitcairn Islands Christians Category:Castaways Category:English pirates",
