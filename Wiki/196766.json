 "text": "Moshi Monsters was a British children's website and massively multiplayer online game. The site opened in November 2007, and by early 2009 had over 1.5 million players. The servers for the game were officially closed on December 13, due to it requiring Adobe Flash Player, which was also discontinued around the same time. Players could adopt a virtual pet monster and collect Moshlings. Players could also buy clothes and other items for the monster. Players could earn credits (called \"Rox\") by solving puzzles and playing simple games. These puzzles test skills such as basic math, spatial awareness, logic, counting, anagrams and vocabulary. The game featured over 200 \"moshlings\" all which come in sets in different themes like \"Movies\" or \"Puppies.\" The website was run by the British company Mind Candy. This game encouraged players to socially network with each other. It has been described as \"Tamagotchi meets Facebook.\" The game was designed for parents looking for a safe and advertisement-free site for young children. The site did, however, promote and sell toys linked to the game. ==References== ==Other websites== * Mind Candy * The Moshi Monster website * Children on Virtual Worlds: What parents should know Category:2008 video games Category:2019 disestablishments Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:British entertainment websites Category:Virtual pet video games",
