 "text": "Ameerega braccata is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 20.3 - 25.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 23.5 - 29.1 mm long. Not all of these frogs are the same color. Mostly, the skin of the frog's back is black with two yellow, gold, or white lines from the mouth to the front legs. Another two lines go from the sides of the nose to the rear end. Sometimes there are two more lines or dots in the middle of the back. There can be brown color on the back. The skin of the belly is light brown or white in color with black spots. There is some orange color near the rear end. There is some red color to confuse other animals on the legs. The chest and throat are brown. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. The frog can live in pantanal grassy places. People have seen it on the dead leaves on the ground in gallery forest and in places with only a few trees. Scientists saw the frog between 160 and 280 meters above sea level. This frog lives in only two places. They are both protected parks: Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Guimar√£es and Parque Nacional do Pantanal Mato-grossense. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. The tadpoles' heads are little bit flat. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans do change the places where the frog lives to agriculture make farms and make places for animals to eat grass. Fires also change the places where the frog lives. People may also catch this frog to sell as a pet, but scientists are not sure. In 2018, Brazil began to let people raise these frogs a little. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
