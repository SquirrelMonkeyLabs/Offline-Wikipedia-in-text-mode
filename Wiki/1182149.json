 "text": "Temple prostitution (or sacred prostitution, cult prostitution, or religious prostitution) is the name for a number of rites involving paid sexual intercourse in the context of religious rites. It is possible that this was done in the context of a fertility rite. When there is no direct payment, scholars speak about sacred sex. Usually, priests or servants of a goddess of sexual love had sex with worshippers, against payment. Even though, scholars used to argue that this existed, they are no longer sure it did. There are different ancient texts that talk about it. The bible also does. It looks like there were slaves in the temple of Aphrodite in Korinth, that also engaged in this. Category:Culture",
