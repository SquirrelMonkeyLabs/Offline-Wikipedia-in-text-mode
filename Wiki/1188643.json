The members were Ruth Ann Roberts, Kimberly Blake, Johnna Lee Cummings, Josselyne Jones and Renee Veneziale. Boy Krazy's other songs were \"All You Have to Do (released in 1992) and \"Good Times with the Bad Boys\". The latter song was released in February 1992. It, however, peaked as high as only #59 under the United States' Billboard Hot 100 Charts. This song was the final release under Boy Krazy. The band broke up in borderline 1993â€“1994. ==References== Category:1990s establishments in the United States Category:1993 disestablishments Category:1990s American music groups Category:American pop music groups Category:American girl groups",
