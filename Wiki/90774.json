 "text": "Montmartre is a hill 130 metres high and is also the name of the district which surrounds the hill. It is in north Paris and famous for its nightlife. Many artists had studios or worked around the community of Montmartre such as Salvador Dal√≠, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. ==Name origin== Montmartre means 'mountain of the martyr.' The name comes from the martyrdom of Saint Denis, who was decapitated on the hill around 250 AD. Saint Denis was the Bishop of Paris and is the patron saint of France. The hill's religious symbolism is thought to be even older. It may have been a druidic holy place because it is the highest point in the area. ==Related pages== * Bohemianism ==References== Category:Paris",
