 "text": "\"Thunderstruck\" is the first single off of Australian rock band AC/DC's twelfth studio album The Razors Edge. The song was released on 10 September 1990. The song was able to make it to #4 on the Rock Digital Songs, #5 on the Mainstream Rock, and #16 on the Digital Song Sales charts. It was also certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). When talking about the song, guitarist Angus Young said \"It started off from a little trick I had on guitar. I played it to Mal and he said 'Oh, I've got a good rhythm idea that will sit well in the back.' We built the song up from that. We fiddled about with it for a few months before everything fell into place. Lyrically, it was really just a case of finding a good title ... We came up with this thunder thing, based on our favourite childhood toy ThunderStreak, and it seemed to have a good ring to it. AC/DC = Power. That's the basic idea.\" A music video for the song was released. It was directed by David Mallet. In the video, the band performs in concert at Brixton Academy in London on 17 August 1990. The video has over 1 billion views on YouTube. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1990 songs Category:AC/DC songs Category:Hard rock songs",
