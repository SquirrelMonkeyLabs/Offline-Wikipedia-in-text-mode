 "text": "Todd Benjamin Heap (born March 16, 1980 in Mesa, Arizona) is an American former football tight end. He played a total of 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the Baltimore Ravens and Arizona Cardinals. Heap was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens out of Arizona State with the 31st pick in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft. ==Career== Heap wore #80 while playing college football and #86 as a professional. With Baltimore, Heap was known for his quiet personality. Heap's NFL career with the Ravens and Cardinals has been plagued by injuries. He has missed portions of most of his NFL seasons and huge parts of the 2004, 2007, and 2011 NFL seasons. However, he is the Ravens second all-time leader in receptions (the Ravens offense struggled much during Heap's stay there, and Heap was often the primary receiver), and all-time leader in yards and touchdowns. He was released by the Ravens in the 2011 offseason, and signed with the Cardinals, where he struggled to produce. Heap has also taken a number of big hits. He has been greatly popular with the Ravens fan base. Heap retired from playing professional football in 2013. On May 13, 2014, the Ravens inducted Heap into their Ring of Honor. ==Personal life== He is married to Ashley and they had five children. On April 14, 2017, Heap accidently killed his daughter Holly Alivia when he ran her over in his driveway while moving his truck. Heap created the Hugs from Holly campaign in her honor. ==References== ==Other websites== *Todd Heap at baltimoreravens.com Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Arizona Cardinals players Category:Baltimore Ravens players Category:American football tight ends Category:Sportspeople from Arizona Category:People from Mesa, Arizona",
