 "text": "Canada Life Centre, originally known as True North Centre and later as MTS Centre and Bell MTS Place, is a sports arena in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The arena opened on November 16, 2004, and is the current home to the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League (NHL). The arena was originally known as True North Centre during planning but naming rights were bought by Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS). After Bell Canada purchased MTS in spring 2017, the arena was renamed effective that May 30. The most recent name change was on July 15, 2021, when insurance and financial services company Canada Life entered into a 10-year naming rights agreement with True North Sports & Entertainment, which owns both the Jets and the arena. The arena has been home to the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL), the Jets' top minor-league team, two different times. The team first played there from 2004 to 2011 before moving to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, and then returned to Winnipeg in 2015. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Indoor arenas Category:Sports buildings in Canada Category:Sport in Manitoba Category:2004 establishments in Canada Category:Winnipeg Jets",
