 "text": "The official flag of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands is a dark blue cloth with the French flag, the \"Tricolor\", in its canton. Near the bottom corner next to the flagpole, the flag shows the white letters “TAAF.” These letters are short for the French name “Terres australes et antarctiques françaises” (French Southern and Antarctic Lands). The letters sit on three white five-pointed stars. This flag design became official in 2007. Category:French Southern and Antarctic Lands Category:Flags",
