 "text": "Tel Aviv Port (נמל תל אביב; Namal Tel Aviv) was an old port in Tel Aviv, Israel. It was used between the years 1938 and 1965. It was next to the mouth of the Yarkon River. After it closed in 1965, it was moved to Ashdod Port and became a warehouse area. In the 2000s, it was renovated and became a commercial and recreational area. Programs of reconstruction and rehabilitation are being carried out after more than ten years. The Tel Aviv Port was a part of a big development area called the Yarkon River Peninsula. It was built beside the Orient Fair and looks like a peninsula from above. The area around the port was built in the 1930s. == Gallery == File:Reading Light 2013.jpg|Tel Aviv Port Lighthouse in 2013 File:Ship near tel aviv's Port, 1932.jpg|a boat before the port was built File:Manofnamal1.jpg|the renovated crane today File:HaNamal IMG 0802.JPG|the prot today File:PikiWiki Israel 2778 Tel Aviv port 1933-4 נמל תל אביב 1933-4.JPG|The site of the future port in 1933-34 with the Orient Fair and Cafe Galina ==Related pages== * Levant Fair == Other websites == * Tel Aviv Port website Category:Buildings and structures in Tel Aviv Category:Ports and harbours of Israel",
