 "text": "DeepSeek is a Chinese company that creates open-source AI models. It is based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the CEO. The company is funded by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer. DeepSeek's AI model, DeepSeek-R1, performs at a level similar to models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. However, it is much cheaper to train, costing only $6 million compared to the $100 million spent on GPT-4 in 2023. It also uses only one- tenth of the computing power of similar AI models. DeepSeek developed its models despite U.S. sanctions limiting China's access to Nvidia chips, which were meant to slow down AI advancements in China and India. On January 10, 2025, DeepSeek launched its first free chatbot app for iOS and Android. By January 27, it had become the most-downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in the U.S., surpassing ChatGPT. This success caused Nvidia's stock to drop by 18%. DeepSeek’s rise has been called a major shift in AI, marking the start of a global AI competition. DeepSeek shares its AI models and training details as open-source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and study its code. The company actively recruits young AI researchers from top Chinese universities and also hires experts from other fields to make its models more diverse and knowledgeable. == References == == Other websites == * DeepSeek on GitHub * DeepSeek on Hugging Face * Official API documentation * Anthology of DeepSeek papers Category:Artificial intelligence",
