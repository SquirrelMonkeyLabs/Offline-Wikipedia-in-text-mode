 "text": "This is a list of countries and dependencies by population. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance the United Kingdom is considered a single entity. In addition this list also includes certain unrecognized states not found in ISO 3166. The number shows how many people live in each country. Countries with the most people are at the top of the list. Countries with the fewest people are at the bottom. ==Method== Figures based on our charts are estimates or projections taken from our national census, where national data are available. Where national data are not available, figures are based on the population estimates of the United Nations. Areas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom are counted as part of the sovereign state concerned. Not included in the list are organizations such as the NATO. Other territories that are marked with an asterisk (*) are territories that do not have permanent population, such as the British Indian Ocean Territory or United States Minor Outlying Islands. ==Sovereign states and dependencies by population== Note: All 193 Members of the United Nations plus the two observer states are assigned a numbered rank. Dependent territories or constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are also included, but not assigned a number rank.
