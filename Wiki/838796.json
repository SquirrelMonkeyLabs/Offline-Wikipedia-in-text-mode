 "text": "200 (two hundred) is the natural number after 199 and before 201. It is the smallest unprimeable number because changing only one of the digits will still result in a composite number. * If we change the first digit to any other digit, we get numbers like 100, 300, 400, and so on. None of these are prime numbers. * If we change the second digit to any other digit, we get numbers like 210, 220, 230, and so on. None of these are prime numbers. * If we change the third digit to any other digit, we get numbers like 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, and 209. Yet again, none of these are prime numbers. ** 203 and 209 are not prime because both numbers can be expressed as the product of 7 x 29 and 11 x 19 respectively. Category:Integers",
