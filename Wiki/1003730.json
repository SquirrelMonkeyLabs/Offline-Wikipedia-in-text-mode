 "text": "\"Adam\" was the name police gave to an unidentified boy whose torso was discovered in the River Thames in London, United Kingdom, on 21 September 2001. The child was between four and eight years old. Investigators believe the child was likely from southwestern Nigeria, and that several days before his murder, he had been trafficked to the United Kingdom for a ritual sacrifice. As of 2023, nobody has been charged with Adam's murder, and his true identity remains unknown. When he was found, the boy was wearing orange girls' shorts. An examination done after the death of the boy found that he had been poisoned. His throat had been slit, likely to drain blood from his body. Also, his head and limbs had been removed. The boy likely came from a region of southwestern Nigeria near Benin City known as the birthplace of voodoo. Police think the boy may have been killed in a voodoo practice known as muti. ==References== Category:Murdered children Category:Murder in London Category:2000s murders in Europe",
