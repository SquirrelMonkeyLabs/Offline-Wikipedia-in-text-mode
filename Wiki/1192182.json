 "text": "Aburni was a king of Nobatia who ruled around 450 AD as the successor of Silko. Aburni is known from a letter found in Qasr Ibrim. The letter, written in poor Greek, was addressed by the king of the Blemmyians, Phonen, and his son, the Phylarch Breytek, to Aburni and his sons Nakase and Mouses. It is the reply to a lost letter. In the letter, Phonen makes it clear that he is an enemy of the Nobatians and mentions various conflicts he had with Silko and his successor Aburni. Phonen reports animals being exchanged for land, whereupon Silko killed the Blemmyrian Phylarch Yeny and abducted numerous priests. It remains unclear whether Phonen got his land back. However, Phonen is the last attested ruler of the Blemmyrians and one may assume that Aburni succeeded in destroying them and taking over their empire. == Literature == * Derek A.
