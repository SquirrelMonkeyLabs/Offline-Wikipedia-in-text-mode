 "text": "Gigantopithecus was the largest ever primate. It lived during the Pleistocene era (1.8 million to 10,000 years ago) when large mammals ruled the Earth. Gigantopithecus is known to have lived in what is now southern China and Indochina (mainland Southeast Asia). He would have been three meters (10 feet) high if he stood on his hind legs, and probably weighed about 544 kg (1200 lbs). In comparison, adult male gorillas stand only 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 136 to 195 kg (300 to 430 lbs). The largest recorded was 183 centimeters (6 feet) tall and weighed 267 kg (589 lbs). ==References== \\- Category:Fossils Category:Hominids",
