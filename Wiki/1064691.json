 "text": "The Great Seal of the Philippines (Filipino: Dakilang Sagisag ng Pilipinas) is a special mark used on important government papers in the Philippines. It can be the physical seal or the design on it. The law says that the President of the Philippines takes care of the seal. According to Republic Act No. 8491, the Great Seal should be round and have the same design as the national Coat of Arms. Around the arms, there's a double circle with the official name of the Philippines in Filipino. The color of the arms doesn't matter, but it should be shown in a specific way. The Great Seal must also have the national motto of the Philippines. It's put on all commissions signed by the President and other important papers of the Philippines, as needed by the law or tradition. The President keeps the Great Seal. ==References== Great Seal Category:National seals",
