 "text": "Casuarina is a genus of 17 tree species in the family Casuarinaceae. They are native to Australia, the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, islands of the western Pacific Ocean, and eastern Africa. This was once the only genus in the family, but it is now split into four genera. They are evergreen shrubs and trees growing to tall. The flowers have no petals. They are in small catkin- like inflorescences. Most species are dioecious, but a few are monoecious. The fruit is a woody, oval structure. It looks a bit like a conifer cone. It has many carpels, each with a single seed and a small wing. == References == Category:Fagales",
