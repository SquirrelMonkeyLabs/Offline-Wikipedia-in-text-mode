 "text": "On 19 March 2011, a multi-state NATO-led military intervention in Libya began in response to events during the First Libyan Civil War. American and British naval forces fired over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and imposed a naval blockade. The French Air Force, British Royal Air Force, and Royal Canadian Air Force forced sorties across Libya. The intervention did not have any foreign soldiers. The Libyan government was unable to fight this off as they were unable to shoot down a single NATO plane. Countries involved with the intervention at first were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Fighting in Libya ended in late October after the killing of Muammar Gaddafi, and NATO said it would end operations over Libya on 31 October 2011. Libya's new government requested that its mission be extended to the end of the year, but on 27 October, the Security Council voted to end NATO's mandate for military action on 31 October. It is reported that over the eight months, NATO members carried out 7,000 bombing sorties targeting Gaddafi's forces. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2011 in Africa Category:2010s in Libya",
