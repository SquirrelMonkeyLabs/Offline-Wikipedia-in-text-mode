He reigned for 30 years until he was deposed in 1862. An election was held to determine the next King and Prince George of Denmark was chosen by the Greek Assembly. In 1924, the Greek population voted to become a republic. However, in 1935, the monarchy was reinstated in another vote. In July 1973, the Greek military junta held a referendum, which abolished the monarchy once again. A year later, the democratically elected Konstantinos Karamanlis held another referendum, which confirmed the abolition of the monarchy. == List of Monarchs of Greece == * Otto I (1832–1862) (deposed) * George I (1863–1913) * Constantine I (1913–1917) (abdicated) * Alexander (1917–1920) * Constantine I (1920–1922) (abdicated) * George II (1922–1924, 1935–1944, 1946–1947) * Paul (1947–1964) * Constantine II (1964–1973) (deposed; monarchy abolished) === List of Consorts === * Amalia of Oldenburg (Consort to Otto I) * Olga Constantinovna of Russia (Consort to George I) * Sophia of Prussia (Consort to Constantine I) * Aspasia Manos (Consort to Alexander) * Elisabeth of Romania (Consort to George II) * Frederica of Hanover (Consort to Paul) * Anne-Marie of Denmark (Consort to Constantine II) === List of Regents === * Pavlos Koutouriotis (1920, Regent after Alexander's death) * Olga Constantinovna (1920, Regent after Alexander's death) * Damaskinos of Athens (1944–1946, Regent until referendum results) Category:19th century in Greece Category:20th century in Greece Gre",
