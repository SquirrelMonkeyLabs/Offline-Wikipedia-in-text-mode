 "text": "The Squad is the unofficial name for a group of seven progressive Democratic Representatives elected in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 congressional elections in the United States House of Representatives. Members are Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez of New York; Ilhan Omar of Minnesota; Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts; Rashida Tlaib of Michigan; Greg Casar of Texas and Summer Lee of Pennsylvania. ==Background== All members are people of color, Democrats, members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and when elected, were under 50 years old. It has been said The Squad reflects the diversity of a younger political generation inspired by Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign. Ocasio- Cortez named the original group of four--Omar, Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib--\"The Squad\" in an Instagram post a week after election day 2018. The average age of the Squad was 38.3 years as of mid-2019, nearly twenty years younger than the overall House average age of 57.6 years. ===Trump attacks=== On July 14, 2019, President Donald Trump tweeted that The Squad should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and [dangerous] places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\" Many saw this comment as racist, especially because all are American citizens (Omar became a naturalized citizen in her youth). The next day, The Squad members responded \"we are here to stay\" in a news conference.\" Trump responded with more tweets. On July 15, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Trump in a tweet: \"It’s important to note that the President’s words yday [sic], telling four American Congresswomen of color 'go back to your own country,' is hallmark language of white supremacists. Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism, and that should concern all Americans.\" == Criticism == Members of the squad have been repeatedly accused of terror support and antisemitism ==Beliefs== Members of the Squad generally hold political views considered to be on the left, such as views about US immigration detention facilities, Islamophobia, universal health care, human rights, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and climate change. ==References== Category:2018 in the United States Category:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez",
