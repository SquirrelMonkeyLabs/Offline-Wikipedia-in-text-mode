 "text": "The Spanish-American War (, desastre del 98, Guerra Hispano-Cubana- Norteamericana or Guerra de Cuba ) was a military conflict between Spain and the United States. It began in April 1898. Hostilities halted in August of that year. The Treaty of Paris was signed in December. The war began after America demanded Spain peacefully end the Cuban fight for independence. The demand was rejected. Strong expansionist sentiment in the United States may have motivated the government to target Spain's remaining overseas territories. These territories included Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam and the Caroline Islands. Riots in Havana by pro-Spanish \"Voluntarios\" gave the United States a reason to send in the warship .

This made the American public opinion show increased support of the conflict. The war ended after decisive naval victories for the United States in the Philippines and Cuba. The Treaty of Paris ended the conflict 109 days after the outbreak of war. That gave the United States ownership of the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam.
