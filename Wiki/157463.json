The ICD is published by the World Health Organization. There have been many revisions, or updated versions, of the ICD. Work on the latest version, ICD-10, began in 1983 and was finished in 1992. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) The ICD gives a special, unique code to: *Every medical condition (including mental health problems) *Specific symptoms, if it is not clear what condition is causing the symptom. (For example, if a person has a cough, but his doctor does not know why, he would just use the ICD code for \"Cough\".) *Changes in the body, or test results that are not normal (if it is not clear what condition is causing these changes). *Injuries or illnesses that are caused by things outside of the body (for example, broken bones, burns, and poisonings) *Social issues that may cause health problems (for example, if a person's job causes health risks, or if the person's health is at risk because of poverty).
