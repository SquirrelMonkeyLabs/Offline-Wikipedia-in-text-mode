 "text": "The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) was developed by the SETI Institute and the Radio Astronomy Laboratory (RAL) at the University of California, Berkeley to construct a radio interferometer that is dedicated to radio astronomy observations. At the same time, it is also used for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The ATA is at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory, northeast of San Francisco, California. The goal is to have 350 antennas. To start, 42 antennas (ATA-42) were put to work on 11 October 2007. However, a lack of money stopped operations in April 2011. In August 2011, ATA got short- term funding. In 2012 UC Berkeley quit the project. It is named after Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. Its old name was the One Hectare Telescope (1hT). ==References== ==Other websites== * Official site at seti.org * Radio Astronomy Laboratory's ATA site * The Search Continues with the Allen Telescope Array.
