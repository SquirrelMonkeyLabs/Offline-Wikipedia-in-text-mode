 "text": "Gary Wayne Coleman (February 8, 1968 - May 28, 2010) was an American actor. Coleman was an African American who was born in Santa Barbara, California, with a kidney disease causing nephritis. Nephritis is an autoimmune destruction of the kidney. The disease stopped his growth at an early age. Because of this, he was only tall. His height was his most notable feature. He received two kidney transplants, one in 1973 and one in 1984. He then needed dialysis every day. He was adopted. He was famous for his role as Arnold Jackson in the American sitcom Diff'rent Strokes. He died of a hemorrhage cause by an accidental fall in Provo, Utah. ==Movies== Year Fil Other notes 1981 The Adventures of Gary Coleman and Barney the Purple Dinosaur and Jimmy the Giraffe 3D 1982 Jimmy the Kid 1994 Party Short subject; Coleman was also associate producer S.F.W.
