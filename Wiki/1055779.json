 "text": "The Université de Montréal (UdeM; French pronunciation: [ynivɛʁsite də mɔ̃ʁeal]; translates to University of Montreal) is a French-language public research university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The university's main campus is located in the Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame- de-Grâce on Mount Royal near the Outremont Summit (also called Mount Murray), in the borough of Outremont. There are thirteen faculties, more than sixty departments and two affiliated schools: the Polytechnique Montréal (School of Engineering; formerly the École polytechnique de Montréal) and HEC Montréal (School of Business). It offers more than 650 undergraduate programmes and graduate programmes, including 71 doctoral programmes. The university was founded as part of the Université Laval in 1878. It became an independent institution after it was issued a papal charter in 1919 and a provincial charter in 1920. Université de Montréal moved from Montreal's Quartier Latin to its present location at Mount Royal in 1942. It was made a secular institution with the passing of another provincial charter in 1967. It is co- educational, and has 34,335 undergraduate and 11,925 post-graduate students (excluding affiliated schools). ==References== Category:1878 establishments in Canada Mont",
