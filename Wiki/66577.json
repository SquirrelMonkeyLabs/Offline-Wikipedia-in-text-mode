 "text": "Arzashkun () was a capital city of the Kingdom of Urartu in the 9th century B.C. It is thought that the city was located north of Lake Van in what is now eastern Turkey. The city had two walls and towers. It was protected from attack, by a thick forest. An army could not easily travel through this forest. The nation of Urartu was at the headwaters of the river Tigris in the 9th century B.C. Shalmaneser III, king of Assyria thought that Urartu was a danger to Assyria. He started an expedition to Urartu in 857. He said that he destroyed the capital, Arzashkun. He also claimed that he traveled as far as Lake Van and left his inscription on Mount Irritia. It is believed that the name Arzashkun is the Assyrian form of an Armenian name. ==Related pages== * Lake Van * Ancient Armenia Category:Ancient Armenia Category:Urartu Category:Former national capitals Category:9th century BC",
