Sota Fukushi played Ichigo in the 2018 live-action movie. ==Biography== Ichigo is a high school boy. He has orange hair and he sees ghosts. While in school, Ichigo meets another student named Rukia Kuchiki. Rukia is actually a member of Soul Society, a secret group of soul reapers who take care of sending souls to the afterlife. Ichigo's family is attacked by a spirit monster called a Hollow on day and Rukia helps save them. Ichigo would be given Rukia's soul reapers powers during the fight after she gets injured. Ichigo would use these new powers to defeat the Hollow and rescue people around his town. When Ichigo was a child, his mother was attacked and killed by Hollow called the Grand Fisher. Ichigo would come face-to-face with the Hollow later on and would defeat him with his new powers. Rukia gets taken back to Soul Society to face the death penalty for giving her powers to Ichigo. Ichigo ends up training with a man named Kisuke Urahara. During his training, Ichigo is able to find out the name of his Zanpakutō (sword) is Zangetsu. He is also able to gain his own Soul Reaper powers. With his new powers, he enters Soul Society with his friends and fights through their military force called Gotei 13. In the Soul Society, he trains under Yoruichi Shihōin and is able to increase his speed after he learns Tensa Zangetsu, his Bankai (second form of his sword). He is able to save Rukia and its shown that Sōsuke Aizen, one of the Captains of the Soul Society, faked his own death and planned everything. When Ichigo faces Aizen later on, he learns a new technique called Final Getsuga Tenshō. When he uses it, his hair grows long and turns black. He uses the new technique to defeat Aizen but loses all of his powers at the same time. ==Reception== Since his introduction, Ichigo has become a very popular and well liked character.
