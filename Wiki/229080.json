 "text": "WWE One Night Stand, also known as ECW One Night Stand and One Night Stand: Extreme Rules was a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2005 to 2008. The matches during these events usually centered around hardcore wrestling. The first two editions were reunion events for the original Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion, which was active from 1992 until 2001. WWE purchased it in 2003 and made a documentary, called The Rise and Fall of ECW. Its popularity led to the company making ECW One Night Stand, featuring WWE and former ECW wrestlers. In May 2006, WWE brought back ECW as their third brand, alongside Raw and SmackDown!. The 2007 and 2008 editions were called WWE One Night Stand: Extreme Rules, as WWE began calling their hardcore matches \"Extreme Rules matches\" since the restart of ECW. In 2009, Extreme Rules was established as its own pay-per-view, replacing One Night Stand. == Events == # Event Date City Venue Main Event Ref. 1 ECW One Night Stand (2005) June 12, 2005 New York, New York Hammerstein Ballroom The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley) vs. Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman 2 ECW One Night Stand (2006) June 11, 2006 John Cena (c) vs. Rob Van Dam in an Extreme Rules match for the WWE Championship 3 One Night Stand (2007) June 3, 2007 Jacksonville, Florida Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena John Cena (c) vs. The Great Khali in a Falls Count Anywhere match for the WWE Championship 4 One Night Stand (2008) June 1, 2008 San Diego, California San Diego Sports Arena Edge vs. The Undertaker in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship == See also == * Extreme Championship Wrestling * List of WWE pay-per-view events * WWE Extreme Rules == References == == Other websites == * Official One Night Stand website Category:World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view events Category:2005 establishments in the United States Category:2008 disestablishments in the United States",
