 "text": "Vibrio is a type of gram-negative bacteria that have a curved rod shape, several species of which can cause food poisoning, usually due to eating seafood that has not been cooked enough. They are usually found in saltwater as they cannot survive in freshwater. Vibrio can breathe with or without oxygen and do not create spores. All members of the genus can move and have flagella on both ends with or without sheaths. Recent phylogenies have been made based on a group of genes (multi-locus sequence analysis). The name Vibrio comes from Filippo Pacini who isolated microorganisms he called \"vibrions\" from cholera patients in 1854. category:Gram-negative bacteria",
