 "text": "On 23 April 2018, a vehicle-ramming attack occurred in North York City Centre at a busy street intersection at Yonge Street in North York, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A white rental van driven by Alek Minassian collided with numerous pedestrians. The motive is currently unknown. Some newspapers said that Minassian was an incel. They also said that he wanted to start an incel rebellion. 11 people were killed and 15 others injured. The first of the ten killed victims to be identified was Anne Marie D'Amico, an analyst for the American-based investment company Invesco which has an office on Yonge Street. The South Korean government announced that two South Korean nationals were confirmed killed, and a third was injured in the attack. U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron expressed their sympathies and condolences when addressing the press at the White House the next day. ==References== Category:2018 in Canada Van attack Category:2010s murders in Canada Category:April 2018 events Category:Mass murder in 2018 Category:Massacres in North America",
