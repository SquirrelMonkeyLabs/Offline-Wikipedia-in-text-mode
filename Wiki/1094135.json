 "text": "A maximum break is the highest break in snooker. It is also known as a maximum, a 147, or a one-four-seven. To make the break, the player must play 36 shots in a row. Doing a maximum break is similar to a nine-dart finish in darts or a 300 game in ten-pin bowling. ==List of official maximum breaks== Official maximum breaks achieved in professional competition Date
