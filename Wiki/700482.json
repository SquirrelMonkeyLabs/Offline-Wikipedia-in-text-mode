The size of a district is based on the number of people who live in that district. A district is often very big if there are few people that live there; a district is often small if it's in a big city because there would are many people living there. ==By country== ===United States=== The United States has 435 districts.See Public Law 62-5 of 1911, though Congress has the authority to change that number.
