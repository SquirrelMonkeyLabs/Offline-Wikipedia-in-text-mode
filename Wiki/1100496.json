 "text": "The Ananjeva Asian tree frog, Annam flying tree frog, or Ananjeva's bush frog (Orixalus gracilipes) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and Laos. The adult frog is 32 mm to 43 mm long from nose to rear end. There are small, white spikes on the nose. There are disks on the toes for climbing. The adult male frog has longer legs than the adult female frog. The adult female frog has warts on her rear end. The skin of the frog's back is grayish in color. There are dark marks on the sides of the body. This frog lives in forests on hills and in lower places. People have seen it between 100 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists think the female frog lays eggs in water that does not move because other frogs in Gracixalus do that. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Quang Nam Elephant Habitat and Species Conservation area. Human beings change the places where the frog lives by cutting down trees. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
