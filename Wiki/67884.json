 "text": "Etiquette, one aspect of decorum, is a code that rules how everyone is expected to behave, according to the social conventions and norms, in society, in a social class, or group. It is usually unwritten, but it may be put in written form. Because they are a product of the society's culture and history, the rules of etiquette are very different from time to time, and from one place and social group to another. ==References== == Other websites == * Debrett's * Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home, by Emily Post (1922) * Global Guide to Etiquette and Customs by Kwintessential * Are Paris Waiters Rude Or Is It You? , by Michel Endene.
