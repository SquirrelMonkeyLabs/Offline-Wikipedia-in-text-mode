 "text": "The AEW World Trios Championship is a professional wrestling championship in All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It is competed for in tag teams of three people. From April to July 2024, it was defended together with Ring of Honor's ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship as the Unified World Trios Championship. ==History== The title was introduced on July 27, 2022. It was announced that there would be a tournament held to crown the first champions. The first champions were The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson). They defeated \"Hangman\" Adam Page and The Dark Order (Alex Reynolds and John Silver) at All Out. Shortly after they won, The Elite had their titles stripped from them and they were suspended. This was because they had gotten into a real-life backstage fight with AEW World Champion CM Punk. Punk was also suspended and had his championship stripped. On the September 7 episode of Dynamite, a six-man tag team match was held for the vacant championships. Death Triangle (Pac, Penta El Zero M, and Rey FÃ©nix) defeated Best Friends (Chuck Taylor, Trent Beretta, and Orange Cassidy) to become the new champions. At Dynasty: Zero Hour on April 21, 2024, ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champions Bullet Club Gold (Jay White, Austin Gunn and Colten Gunn) defeated The Acclaimed (Anthony Bowens, Max Caster, and Billy Gunn) for the AEW World Trios Championship in a Winners Take All match to make the titles into one as the Unified World Trios Championship. On July 10, 2024 (aired July 13), Bullet Club Gold (who were renamed the Bang Bang Gang) were stripped of the Unified Trios Titles and the AEW and ROH titles were separated again. == Title history == == Footnotes == == References == == Other websites == *Official website Category:All Elite Wrestling championships Category:Wrestling competitions",
