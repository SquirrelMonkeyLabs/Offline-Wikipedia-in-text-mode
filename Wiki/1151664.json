 "text": "Sambahsa, short for Sambahsa-Mundialect, is a constructed language designed by French linguist Olivier Simon in 2007. It is based on Proto-Indo-European (PIE), the ancient ancestor of many modern languages, but also incorporates vocabulary from non-PIE languages like Arabic, Chinese, and Swahili. The name \"Sambahsa\" combines the Malay words sama (same) and bahsa (language). == Purpose and features == Sambahsa is an auxiliary language intended for international communication. Unlike simpler constructed languages like Esperanto, Sambahsa retains a complex grammar and historical linguistic elements, aiming for realism and versatility. It has: * Four grammatical cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. * Two numbers: singular and plural. * Four genders: masculine, feminine, neuter, and undetermined (a new feature for inclusivity). * A unique verb system influenced by PIE. == Vocabulary == Sambahsa has an extensive vocabulary for an auxiliary language, with contributions from Indo-European and non-Indo-European languages. This makes it a worldlang, a type of constructed language blending features from many linguistic families. == Learning and use == Sambahsa offers detailed resources for learners, including guides and online materials. Its complex grammar appeals to linguists and enthusiasts, but the language is less popular compared to simpler alternatives. == References == == Other websites == * Official Website of Sambahsa * A Sambahsa English Dictionary * Sambahsa- English dictionary on Glosbe (providing dictionaries to many other languages) * Sambahsa-mundialect Wiki Category:International auxiliary languages Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 2000s Category:2007 introductions Category:Constructed languages",
