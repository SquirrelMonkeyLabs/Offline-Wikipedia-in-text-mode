 "text": "In chemical nomenclature, the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry is a way of naming organic chemical compounds. It was created by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). It is published in the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry (informally called the Blue Book). Every possible organic compound should have a name. This name should be able to, every possible organic compound should have a name. This name should be able to create its own structural formula. There is also an IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry. Some of the names of organic compounds are very long. This means that not every IUPAC name recommendations are not always followed. They are only used when it is important to show a unique chemical formula (or to be \"unambiguous\"). The common name (also called the trivial name) can be usually simpler than the IUPAC name. Structural formulas can also be more clear than IUPAC names. However, IUPAC names are sometimes be simpler than older names. For example, \"ethanol\" can be used instead of \"ethyl alcohol\". ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==Other websites== *IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry (online version of several older editions of the IUPAC Blue Book) *IUPAC Recommendations on Organic & Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols, Terminology, etc. (includes IUBMB Recommendations for biochemistry) *Bibliography of IUPAC Recommendations on Organic Nomenclature (last updated 11 April 2003) *ACD/Name Software for generating systematic nomenclature *ChemAxon Name <> Structure â€“ ChemAxon IUPAC (& traditional) name to structure and structure to IUPAC name software.
