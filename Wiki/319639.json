 "text": "Switzerland has sent athletes to every Olympic Games since the first Games in 1896. Switzerland boycotted the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne but the equestrian events for those Games were held in Stockholm, Sweden earlier that year. The Swiss dressage team won a bronze medal. Switzerland has hosted the Games twice. They hosted the 1928 Winter Olympics and the 1948 Winter Olympics. Both were in St. Moritz. Swiss athletes have won a total of 181 medals at the Summer Olympic Games. They have won 127 at the Winter Olympic Games. The National Olympic Committee for Switzerland was created in 1912 ==Medal tables== ===Medals by Summer Games=== 1896 Athens 1 2 0 3 1900 Paris 6 2 1 9 1904 St. Louis 1 0 1 2 1908 London 0 0 0 0 1912 Stockholm 0 0 0 0 1920 Antwerp 2 2 7 11 1924 Paris 7 8 10 25 1928 Amsterdam 7 4 4 15 1932 Los Angeles 0 1 0 1 1936 Berlin 1 9 5 15 1948 London 5 10 5 20 1952 Helsinki 2 6 6 14 1956 Melbourne/Stockholm 0 0 1 1 1960 Rome 0 3 3 6 1964 Tokyo 1 2 1 4 1968 Mexico City 0 1 4 5 1972 Munich 0 3 0 3 1976 Montreal 1 1 2 4 1980 Moscow 2 0 0 2 1984 Los Angeles 0 4 4 8 1988 Seoul 0 2 2 4 1992 Barcelona 1 0 0 1 1996 Atlanta 4 3 0 7 2000 Sydney 1 6 2 9 2004 Athens 1 1 3 5 2008 Beijing 2 0 5 7 2012 London 2 2 0 4 Total 47 73 65 185 ===Medals by Winter Games=== 1924 Chamonix 2 0 1 3 1928 St. Moritz (host nation) 0 0 1 1 1932 Lake Placid 0 1 0 1 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1 2 0 3 1948 St. Moritz (host nation) 3 4 3 10 1952 Oslo 0 0 2 2 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo 3 2 1 6 1960 Squaw Valley 2 0 0 2 1964 Innsbruck 0 0 0 0 1968 Grenoble 0 2 4 6 1972 Sapporo 4 3 3 10 1976 Innsbruck 1 3 1 5 1980 Lake Placid 1 1 3 5 1984 Sarajevo 2 2 1 5 1988 Calgary 5 5 5 15 1992 Albertville 1 0 2 3 1994 Lillehammer 3 4 2 9 1998 Nagano 2 2 3 7 2002 Salt Lake City 3 2 6 11 2006 Turin 5 4 5 14 2010 Vancouver 6 0 3 9 Total 44 37 46 127 ===Medals by summer sport=== Gymnastics 16 19 13 48 Rowing 6 8 9 23 Shooting 6 6 8 20 Equestrian 4 10 8 22 Wrestling 4 4 6 14 Cycling 3 6 7 16 Tennis 2 0 0 2 Fencing 1 4 3 8 Sailing 1 2 1 4 Judo 1 1 2 4 Triathlon 1 0 2 3 Athletics 0 6 2 8 Weightlifting 0 2 2 4 Football 0 1 0 1 Canoeing 0 1 0 1 Swimming 0 0 1 1 Volleyball 0 0 1 1 Handball 0 0 1 1 Total 45 70 66 181 ===Medals by winter sport=== Alpine skiing 18 19 19 56 Bobsleigh 9 10 11 30 Snowboarding 5 1 3 9 Ski jumping 4 1 0 5 Freestyle skiing 3 0 1 4 Nordic combined 1 2 1 4 Curling 1 2 2 5 Skeleton 1 0 2 3 Biathlon 1 0 0 1 Figure skating 0 2 1 3 Cross-country skiing 1 0 4 5 Ice hockey 0 0 2 2 Total 44 37 46 127 ==Related pages== * List of IOC country codes == References == ==Other websites == * * Switzerland profile at London2012.com Category:Nations at the Olympics Olympics Category:National sports teams of Switzerland",
