 "text": "The R160A and R160B are types of New York City Subway cars manufactured by Alstom and Kawasaki. The R160A cars were manufactured by Alstom, and the R160B cars were manufactured by Kawasaki. They were made in 2005 and delivered in 2006. By 2010 all units were in New York and were assigned to multiple routes on the New York City Subway. They are New Technology Trains (NTT). There are 4 types of R160s, they are the R160A-1, R160A-2, R160B-1, R160B-2. The R160A-1 Alstom (4-car sets) are numbered 8313–8652; 9943–9974, and the R160A-2 Alstom (5-car sets) are numbered 8653–8712; 9233–9802. The R160B-1 Alstom (5-car sets) are numbered 8713-8842, 9103-9232, and 9803-9942, and the R160B-2 Siemens sets are numbered 8843-9102. They were both built to run on the NYC Subway B Division Lines, IND and BMT Lines (lettered services). All the R160A cars, and the R160B-1 cars have an Alstom train propulsion, and the R160B-2 cars have a Siemens train propulsion during acceleration, and braking. The R160A-1 are the 4-car sets that run primarily on the (J), (M), and (Z) lines. Some sets (8313-8376) are designated for the (L) line, along with the R143s. These are maintained at the East New York Yard for the BMT Eastern Division (as of this day). The R160A-2 are the 5-car sets that run on the IND Queens Boulevard Line; (E), (F), and (R) lines, along with R160B-1s, and R160B-2s. [(M) trains run part time service on the Queens Boulevard Line, on weekdays (Monday to Friday, approximately 6 AM to 9 PM)] These are maintained at the Jamaica Yard (subject to change). The R160A-2, R160B-1, and R160B-2 cars that are based on the (E), (F), and (R) lines were previously based on the (G) line but had to be removed due to flat wheels on this fleet. They will soon be back on the (G) line when this issue is resolved. The R160B-1 and R160B-2 are also maintained at the Jamaica Yard, and are designated for the (E), (F), and (R) lines (as of this day, subject to change). These are also 5-car sets. The difference between an R160B-1, and an R160B-2 is that the R160B-2 cars are Siemens sets (sets with Siemens train propulsion), and R160B-1 cars are Alstom sets (sets with Alstom train propulsion).
