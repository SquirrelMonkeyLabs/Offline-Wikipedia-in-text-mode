 "text": "Tropical Storm Alberto (also known as Hurricane Alberto) became a tropical storm farther north than any other Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was the first tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. It started from a region of low pressure off of the coast of South Carolina on August 5. It quickly moved northeast. It became a tropical storm on August 7. It was about 60 miles (95 km) east of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. Tropical Storm Alberto continued to move quickly, and struck the western area of Nova Scotia late on August 7. It lost its status as a tropical storm the next day when it reached north of Newfoundland. Alberto produced light rain and wind across its path. No damage came from it. == References == Category:Atlantic tropical storms Category:1980s in Canada Category:1988 in the United States Category:20th century in Maine Category:1980s in weather",
