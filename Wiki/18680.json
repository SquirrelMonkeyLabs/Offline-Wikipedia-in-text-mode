The book was very popular. It was a New York Times best seller for 67 weeks. The novel takes place from 1945 to 1955. It tells the story of Vito Corleone from childhood to adulthood. Paramount Pictures wanted to make a movie about the novel. The studio gave Puzo money to finish the novel so it could be filmed. Paramount originally wanted to make the film for $80,000 and release it in 1971.Jones, Jenny M. (2007). The Annotated Godfather: The Complete Screenplay. New York, New York: Black Dog & Leventhal. ISBN 978-1-57912-739-8. Archived from the original on October 25, 2015, p. 9-14 The film's main plot is the same as the book. However, a few things in the novel are not in the movie. Some subplots and backstories are not in the film. For instance, Johnny Fontane and Lucy Mancini are more developed in the book. The book also gives a background to the villain Jack Woltz. The childhood of Vito Corleone is not in the film. In the book, Johnny Fontane goes to Hollywood. In the end, Kay Corleone accepts Michael as the new boss over the family. She realizes how heartless her husband is. The characters in the movie are the same in the book. Both the book and the movie are about the Corleone crime family. Vito Corleone serves as the crime boss. Vito Corleone and the other characters are not based on real-life people. However, some characters connect to real-life mobsters. These include the real \"Five Families\" in New York. Real-life mobsters like Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino were a basis for Vito Corleone. Johnny Fontane is based on Frank Sinatra. === Direction === Paramount wanted Italian-Americans in the movie. Robert Evans and others from Paramount believed that their last film, The Brotherhood, was unsuccessful because there were no Italian-Americans. Paramount first wanted Sergio Leone to direct the film. The studio also went to Peter Bogdanovich, Peter Yates, Richard Brooks, Arthur Penn, Costa-Gavras, and Otto Preminger. All of them said no to the movie. Francis Ford Coppola, who would direct the film, said no at first. He thought the book was \"cheap stuff\". He changed his mind because of finances and advice from others. There was much tension between Coppola and Paramount. Francis Ford Coppola wanted the movie to be in the 1940s and 1950s like the book. He also wanted a larger budget to make the film in New York City and Sicily. Paramount allowed this because the book was so popular. The studio had wanted a low-budget film because previous films were unsuccessful. Coppola did many screen tests, which cost money. There were disagreements about whether to have Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the film. Coppola wanted the actors, but Evans did not. Some people wanted to fire Coppola, but he eventually had several people fired. === Writing === Both Puzo and Coppola worked on the screenplay separately. Paramount paid Puzo $100,000 to write the script. Puzo wanted to stick to his book. This was the first screenplay Puzo had written. Coppola wanted to emphasize the themes of culture, character, power, and family. Coppola created a booklet with pages from The Godfather and made notes on 50 scenes. The final script was completed on March 29, 1971 and was 163 pages long.Jones, Jenny M. (2007). The Annotated Godfather: The Complete Screenplay. New York, New York: Black Dog & Leventhal. ISBN 978-1-57912-739-8. Archived from the original on October 25, 2015, p. 11, 20, 252. The Italian-American Civil Rights League, led by Joseph Colombo, wanted words like \"mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" not to be used in the film. Any of these words in the script were replaced with other words. === Casting === Puzo and Coppola wanted to have Marlon Brando play Vito Corleone. Paramount was against this and wanted Ernest Borgnine. Other people considered for the role were George C. Scott, Richard Conte, Anthony Quinn and Orson Welles. Borgnine and Brando were the two finalists.Williams, Joe (2012). Hollywood Myths: The Shocking Truths Behind Film's Most Incredible Secrets and Scandals. Minneapolis, Minnesota: MBI Pub. Co. and Voyageur Press. ISBN 978-1-250-03249-2. Archived from the original on October 17, 2015, p. 188. Paramount would only cast Brando under certain conditions. Brando would have to do a screen test, earn less for the film, and was not allowed to cause any problems. For Michael Corleone, Paramount wanted Warren Beatty or Robert Redford. Robert Evans wanted Ryan O'Neal. Coppola wanted Al Pacino.Jones, Jenny M. (2007). The Annotated Godfather: The Complete Screenplay. New York, New York: Black Dog & Leventhal. ISBN 978-1-57912-739-8.

Dustin Hoffman, Martin Sheen, and James Caan auditioned as well.The Godfather DVD Collection documentary A Look Inside, [2001] At first, James Caan was to play Michael. Coppola convinced Evans to have Pacino play Michael.Cowie, Peter (1997). The Godfather Book. London, England: Faber and Faber Limited. ISBN 978-0-571-19011-9, p. 23-24. Paramount chose actors based on their heights. For instance, they chose Caan because he was short, like Pacino. Al Martino was a singer. He wanted to play Johnny Fontane. Coppola removed him and replaced him with Vic Damone. Martino went to his crime boss. The boss published papers about Coppola switching the roles. Eventually, Damone gave up the part to please the mob. Robert De Niro originally wanted to play Paulie Gatto, but he quit. Johnny Martino took his place. The actors Diane Keaton, John Cazale, and Gianni Russo got their roles in the film. Coppola gave his family members roles. They included his sister Talia Shire, his daughter Sofia and his father, Carmine. === Filming === Actors could practice the script for two weeks before filming. The two weeks ended with a dinner, where everyone had to play their roles. Most of the film was shot in real locations in New York City and Sicily. Filming was in New York City from March 29, 1971, to July 2, 1971, and in Sicily until August 6, 1971. After filming, scenes from the film were removed. Most of these scenes did not add to the plot.Lebo, Harlan (1997). The Godfather Legacy: The Untold Story of the Making of the Classic Godfather Trilogy. London, England: Simon & Schuster. ISBN 978-0-684-83647-8. Archived from the original on June 5, 2020, p. 87-88, 93, 184, 185. Coppola worked with cinematographer Gordon Willis. They did not use modern filming techniques. Instead, they used the \"tableau format\". Tableau shots are when actors and objects are in the picture like a painting. The two used light and darkness and shadows to show psychological changes.Lebo, Harlan (1997). The Godfather Legacy: The Untold Story of the Making of the Classic Godfather Trilogy. London, England: Simon & Schuster. ISBN 978-0-684-83647-8. Archived from the original on June 5, 2020, p. 70.

In Sicily, scenes were in Savoca and Forza d'Agrò. === Music === Coppola hired Nino Rota to be the composer for the film. He wrote several pieces, including the \"Love Theme.\" Rota used some of his music from Fortunella (1958). Evans did not like the music, but Coppola convinced Evans to keep it. Coppola thought the music made the film more Italian. Coppola's father, Carmine Coppola, also composed some music. Other music in the film include Cherubino's aria, \"Non so più cosa son\" from Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart and \"C'è la luna mezzo mare\", a Sicilian song.Lebo, Harlan (1997).

They removed stereotypes about Italian-Americans. The films tried to show the Mafia realistically and from the criminals' perspective. The Godfather trilogy changed the gangster genre. The family is central in the movies. There are no reckless and brutal criminals, but criminals who protect and support the family. The movies were also about the failures of the American Dream. The Godfather opens with the words, \"I believe in America\". The movie shows the corruption of American business.The Godfather Effect, p. 7; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, ISBN 978-1-250-00513-7 The films reflected public opinion.
