 "text": "Altes Museum (German for Old Museum) is a museum in Berlin. It is on the Museum Island (Museuminsel) along the Spree River. The museum is made of Greek columns but it is not of Greek origin. It is considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was created between 1822-1830 and holds the Antikensammlung and Münzenkabinett. The Berliner Lustgarten is in front of the museum. The Altes Museum was intended to be a royal collection of art and a public museum to educate the people. It was originally called the Königliches Museum. This mission was in line with the educational ideals of Humboldt. Karl Friedrich Schinkel was involved in the planning, and the building was constructed from 1825 to 1828 in neoclassical style. The museum opened in 1830. It was named Altes Museum after the Neues Museum was built in 1845. Originally the commission only included \"high art\" of Rome and Greece. During Word War 2, the Nazis used the museum in their propaganda. Suffering some damage during World War 2, the building was mostly renovated between 1951 and 1966. == Other websites == * Altes Museum on GreatBuildings.com * Altes Museum on Archiseek * Altes Museum on museum-location.de (in German) Category:Museums in Berlin",
