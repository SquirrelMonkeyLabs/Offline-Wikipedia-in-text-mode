 "text": "Yangchuanosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur from the Jurassic of China. It was a fairly typical carnosaur, with a large head, sharp, serrated teeth, and relatively short arms (though not as short as those of Tyrannosaurus). It was the largest predator in its part of the world. Yangchuanosaurus probably preyed on sauropods, such as Mamenchisaurus, or stegosaurs, such as Tuojiangosaurus. There are two species. Y. zigongensis is from the Middle Jurassic, and Y. shangyouensis is from the Upper Jurassic. Specimens were collected from the Dashanpu Dinosaur Quarry of Zigong, Sichuan. The Middle Jurassic Y. zigongensis is known from four incomplete specimens. There are two specimens of the Upper Jurassic Y. shangyouensis, which were at first put into separate species. Later analysis showed they were probably different ages or variations of the same species.Carrano M.T; Benson R B.J. & Sampson S.D. 2012. The phylogeny of Tetanurae (Dinosauria: Theropoda).

It had a massive tail that was about half its length. == References == Category:Carnosaurs Category:Jurassic dinosaurs",
