It is one of the three stations with long- distance services in Munich, the others being Munich East station (München Ost) and Munich-Pasing station (München-Pasing). München Hauptbahnhof has about 450,000 passengers a day, which puts it on par with other large stations in Germany, such as Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof. It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 1 station, one of 21 in Germany and two in Munich, the other being München Ost. The mainline station is a terminal station with 32 platforms. The subterranean S-Bahn with 2 platforms and U-Bahn stations with 6 platforms are through stations. The first Munich station was built about to the west in 1839. A station at the current site was opened in 1849 and it has been rebuilt numerous times. The main station building was badly damaged during World War II. ==Location== The station is located close to Munich's city centre in the north of the borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt. The main entrance to the east of the station is via the Prielmayerstraße or Bayerstraße to Karlsplatz (Stachus). In the station forecourt (Bahnhofsplatz) in front of the main entrance are tram stops on several lines. The station is bordered to the north by Arnulfstraße and to the west by Paul-Heyse-Straße, which passes through a tunnel near the end of the platforms. The station is bordered to the south by Bayerstraße. The station precinct extends some distance to the west and ends at Donnersbergerbrücke. == Reconstruction == The proposal for an extensive reconstruction project of Hauptbahnhof was launched in 2015 with planning approved in 2017 and 2018. It should be finished by 2028. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Munich Category:1839 establishments in Europe Category:19th-century establishments in Germany",
