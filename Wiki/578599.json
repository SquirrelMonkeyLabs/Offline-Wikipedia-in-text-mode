 "text": "Narcissism is a condition in which a person admires their own attributes via vanity or egotism. The word comes from Narcissus, a figure from Greek mythology who fell in love with the sight of his own face. ==Dark-ego-vehicle principle== The dark-ego-vehicle principle (DEVP) is a recent concept in psychology suggesting that those with dark personalities, especially high narcissistic traits, are more likely to get involved in political activism. * * * * * * ===Research=== In recent studies, researchers recruited participants online to complete surveys on their personality traits and their participation in identity-based activism. They ran regression analyses on the results, finding that those with more narcissistic traits are more likely to be in such activism. The researchers also hypothesized that antisemitism could be explained by the dark-ego-vehicle principle. They found that antisemitism and dark personality traits correlated with each other in 94% of the cases, with hostile and manipulative personality traits strongly associated with antisemitic beliefs. Furthermore, the researchers found that those with antisemitic beliefs were more likely to show signs of aggression, dominance, selfishness, sensation seeking and virtue signaling. In addition, the researchers believed that the dark-ego-vehicle principle could be used for antisemitism studies, where relevant research could be conducted with a longitudinal study with a larger sample and several measurement points in order to establish any cause and effect. ==Related pages== * Arrogance * Megalomania * Dunningâ€“Kruger effect * Narcissistic personality disorder ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Psychology",
