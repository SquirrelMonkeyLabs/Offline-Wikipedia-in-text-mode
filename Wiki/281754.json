 "text": "The Castle of Bredevoort was a castle in the city of Bredevoort, Guelders in the Netherlands. ==History== The name of the castle was for the first time written in the year 1188 as \"castrum Breidervort\". In 1646 lightning hit the gunpowder tower of the castle, causing an explosion that destroyed the castle and the town, killing Lord Haersolte of Bredevoort and his family, as well as others. Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. In April 2009 big walls were discovered underground in the heart of the town. On the square they found remain of the gate building which was a part of the ring wall surrounding the castle. That foundation is visible on the square today.
