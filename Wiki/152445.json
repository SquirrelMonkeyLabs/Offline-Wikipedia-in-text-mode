 "text": "WWE No Way Out was a series of Professional wrestling pay-per-view shows made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The event usually took place in February and typically was the last pay-per-view before WrestleMania. The first No Way Out event was in 1998 as an In Your House event, called No Way Out of Texas: In Your House. The event did not take place in 1999, 2010 and 2011, but was brought back in 2000 and 2012. The 2008 and 2009 events were based around the Elimination Chamber match. In 2010, WWE created their own Elimination Chamber PPV event, which replaced No Way Out in its February slot. ==Events== SmackDown!-branded event # Event Date City Venue Main Event Ref. 1 No Way Out of Texas: In Your House February 15, 1998 Houston, Texas Compaq Center Stone Cold Steve Austin, Owen Hart, Cactus Jack, and Chainsaw Charlie vs. Triple H, Savio Vega, and The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) 2 No Way Out (2000) February 27, 2000 Hartford, Connecticut Hartford Civic Center Triple H (c) vs. Cactus Jack in a Title vs. Career Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship 3 No Way Out (2001) February 25, 2001 Las Vegas, Nevada Thomas & Mack Center Kurt Angle (c) vs. The Rock for the WWF Championship 4 No Way Out (2002) February 17, 2002 Milwaukee, Wisconsin Bradley Center Chris Jericho (c) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin for the Undisputed WWF Championship 5 No Way Out (2003) February 23, 2003 Montreal, Quebec, Canada Bell Centre The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan 6 No Way Out (2004) February 15, 2004 Daly City, California Cow Palace Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Championship 7 No Way Out (2005) February 20, 2005 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Mellon Arena John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (c) vs. Big Show in a Barbed wired Steel Cage match for the WWE Championship 8 No Way Out (2006) February 19, 2006 Baltimore, Maryland 1st Mariner Arena Kurt Angle (c) vs. The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship 9 No Way Out (2007) February 18, 2007 Los Angeles, California Staples Center John Cena and Shawn Michaels vs. Batista and The Undertaker 10 No Way Out (2008) February 17, 2008 Las Vegas, Nevada Thomas & Mack Center Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield vs. Umaga vs. Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy in an Elimination Chamber match for a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XXIV 11 No Way Out (2009) February 15, 2009 Seattle, Washington KeyArena John Cena (c) vs. Edge vs. Chris Jericho vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Kane vs. Mike Knox in an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship 12 No Way Out (2012) June 17, 2012 East Rutherford, New Jersey Izod Center John Cena vs. Big Show in a Steel Cage match == References == == Other websites == * Official website for No Way Out * Official history website for No Way Out Category:1998 establishments in the United States Category:2012 disestablishments in the United States",
