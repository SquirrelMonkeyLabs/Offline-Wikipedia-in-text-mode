A longtime criminal can be declared an outlaw, which means the outlaw cannot use the legal system to protect himself if needed. ==Famous outlaws== *The Emperor Nero was made an outlaw by the Roman Senate in 68 AD *Robin Hood, the English folk hero, who was probably a combination of several real and legendary outlaws. *Martin Luther was outlawed in 1521. *Carmine Crocco, the most famous Italian outlaw of the XIX century, an escaped convict who joined the liberal revolution of Garibaldi but returned to banditry because he didn't get the promised forgiveness. Then he became the leader of 2.000 men, heading the most feared peasant army in southern Italy at the time. *Ben Hall, the Australian bushranger. The government passed a law in 1865 which outlawed the gang and made it legal for anyone to kill them. There was no need for the outlaws to be arrested, or for there to be a trial. *Billy the Kid, American gunman and cowboy who took part in the Lincoln County War. *Ned Kelly, the Australian bushranger. The government passed a law on 30 October 1878 to make the Kelly gang outlaws. They no longer had any legal rights.
