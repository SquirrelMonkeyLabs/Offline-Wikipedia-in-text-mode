Older people - over 66 and over 70 - have higher limits. The weekly income limit for a single person living alone under 66 is €184 after tax, Universal Social Charge and Pay Related Social Insurance. For people over 70 the limit is €550 for a single person. There are also allowances for housing costs and the costs of travelling to work. Savings, investments or property of more than €36,000 for a single person gives a weekly income for each €1,000. The card entitles the holder to free visits to general practitioners, free or very reduced-price hospital and dental treatment, and prescribed medicine for a charge of €1.50 per item. People who dont have a medical card may be able to get a GP visit card. This lets them visit a participating family doctor (GP) for free. This has higher income limits. All children under the age of 6 and people getting get Carer’s Benefit or Carer’s Allowance get one free. 300,000 fewer people had medical cards in 2021 than in 2011 but 86,000 more had GP visit cards. == References == Category:Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland",
