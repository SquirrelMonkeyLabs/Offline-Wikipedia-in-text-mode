The stadium was able to hold 18,000 people and opened in 1945. RCD Mallorca left the stadium in 1999 when ONO Estadi (Son Moix) opened, but the reserve team RCD Mallorca B continued to use the stadium until 2007, before they moved to Son Bibiloni, the club's training complex to the north of Palma. Its name is due to Lluís Sitjar, former president of RCD Mallorca on several occasions. It was renamed after him on 1960.Gran Enciclopèdia de Mallorca. Volume 16.
