 "text": "Margaret Mead (December 16, 1901 – November 15, 1978) was an American cultural anthropologist. She was an author and speaker in the mass media in the 1960s and 1970s. She was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences in 1975. Mead was a communicator of anthropology in modern American and Western culture. As an academic, she was often controversial. Her reports about attitudes toward sex in the South Pacific and Southeast Asian culture traditions influenced the 1960s sexual revolution. Mead was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She died from pancreatic cancer in New York City. ==Publications by Mead== Note: See also Margaret Mead: The Complete Bibliography 1925–1975, Joan Gordan, ed., The Hague: Mouton. ===As a sole author=== *Coming of Age in Samoa (1928) *Growing Up In New Guinea (1930) *The Changing Culture of an Indian Tribe (1932) *Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies (1935) *And Keep Your Powder Dry: An Anthropologist Looks at America (1942) *Male and Female (1949) *New Lives for Old: Cultural Transformation in Manus, 1928–1953 (1956) *People and Places (1959; a book for young readers) *Continuities in Cultural Evolution (1964) *Culture and Commitment (1970) *The Mountain Arapesh: Stream of events in Alitoa (1971) *Blackberry Winter: My Earlier Years (1972; autobiography) ===As editor or coauthor=== *Balinese Character: A Photographic Analysis, with Gregory Bateson, 1942, New York Academy of Sciences. * Soviet Attitudes Toward Authority (1951) *Cultural Patterns and Technical Change, editor (1953) *Primitive Heritage: An Anthropological Anthology, edited with Nicholas Calas (1953) *An Anthropologist at Work, editor (1959, reprinted 1966; a volume of Ruth Benedict's writings) *The Study of Culture at a Distance, edited with Rhoda Metraux, 1953 *Themes in French Culture, with Rhoda Metraux, 1954 *The Wagon and the Star: A Study of American Community Initiative co-authored with Muriel Whitbeck Brown, 1966 *A Rap on Race, with James Baldwin, 1971 *A Way of Seeing, with Rhoda Metraux, 1975 ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1978 deaths Category:American anthropologists Category:Writers from Philadelphia Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer",
