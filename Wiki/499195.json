 "text": "Death Row Records is an American record label. It was founded in 1991 by Tracy \"The D.O.C.\" Lynn Curry, Andre \"Dr. Dre\" Young, Suge Knight and Richard Gilbert \"Dick\" Griffey. Artists including Snoop Doggy Dogg, Nate Dogg, Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, The Lady of Rage, RBX and Michel'le agreed to join the label, following with the label's biggest star Tupac Shakur. The label declined when Shakur was killed in September 1996, Knight was charged with parole violation the following year, and when Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, and many others left the label. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2006, and was sold to the MNRK Music Group (formally eOne Music). Snoop Dogg later purchased the rights to the trademark and music of Death Row Records in 2022. He intends to revive the record label, which is currently active as an NFT label since. == Notable artists == === Current artists === Act Years signed Releases under the label Snoop Dogg CEO 1992–1998 2022–present 3 Mount Westmore 2022–present 1 Merkules 2022–present 1 ===Former artists=== Act Years signed Releases under the label The D.O.C. 1991-1994 – Dr. Dre 1991–1996 1 Michel'le 1991–1999 2002-2003 1 CPO Boss Hogg 1992–1996 – Daz Dillinger 1992-1999 1 Tha Dogg Pound 1992-1996 1 Jewell 1992–1999 – Kurupt 1992-1996 2002-2005 1 The Lady of Rage 1992–1999 1 Nate Dogg 1992-1998 – RBX 1992-1994 – Sam Sneed 1993–1996 – Lil' Bow Wow 1993-1994 – Danny Boy 1994–1999 – J-Flexx 1994–1999 – O.F.T.B. 1994–1997 – Young Soldierz 1994–1998 – Tupac Shakur/2Pac 1995–1996 7 (6 posthumous albums) Johnny J 1995–1996 – K-Solo 1995–1996 – MC Hammer 1995–1996 – Prince Ital Joe 1995–1998 – Young Noble 1996–1997 – Bad Azz 1996–1998 – Butch Cassidy 1996–1998 – Tha Realest 1996–2001 – CJ Mac 1997–2000 – YGD Tha Top Dogg 1997–1999 – Crooked I 1999–2003 – Mac Shawn 1999–2000 – Miilkbone 1999 – Spider Loc 2000–2004 – Lisa Lopes 2001–2002 – Mark Morrison 2001–2002 – Petey Pablo 2004 – ==Albums== * Dr. Dre - The Chronic (1992) * Snoop Doggy Dogg - Doggystyle (1993) * Various artists - Above the Rim soundtrack (1994) * Various artists - Murder Was the Case soundtrack (1994) * Tha Dogg Pound - Dogg Food (1995) * 2Pac - All Eyez on Me (1996) * Makaveli - The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996) * Snoop Doggy Dogg - Tha Doggfather (1996) * Various artists - Death Row Greatest Hits (1996) * Various artists - Christmas on Death Row (1996) * Nate Dogg - G-Funk Classics, Vol. 1 (1997) (shelved) * Various artists - Gridlock'd soundtrack (1997) * The Lady of Rage - Necessary Roughness (1997) * Various artists - Gang Related (1997) * Daz Dillinger - Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back (1998) * Michel'le - Hung Jury (1998) * 2Pac - Greatest Hits (1998) * Various artists - Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000 (1999) * 2Pac + Outlawz - Still I Rise (1999) * Various artists - Too Gangsta for Radio (2000) * Snoop Dogg - Dead Man Walkin' (2000) * 2Pac - Until the End of Time (2001) * Tha Dogg Pound - 2002 (2001) * Snoop Doggy Dogg - Death Row's Snoop Doggy Dogg Greatest Hits (2001) * Mark Morrison - Innocent Man (2002) (Death Row UK; shelved) * N.I.N.A. - New Identity Non Apllicable (2002) (shelved) * 2Pac - Better Dayz (2002) * Various artists - Dysfunktional Family soundtrack (2003) ==References== Category:1991 establishments in California Category:American record labels",
