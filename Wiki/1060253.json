 "text": "The Sportvereinigung Donau (SV Donau or SV Donau Wien for short) is an Austrian football club from the 22nd district Donaustadt in Vienna. The club played in the first division in the 1933/34 season. The sports club currently plays in the Wiener Stadtliga, the fourth highest division in Austria. The club colors are blue and black. ==History== The club was founded in 1910. They merged with Olympia, Lagerhaus and KAC before the First World War. In 1933, they were promoted to the top Austrian league for the first time. In 1941 there was a merger with FC Franz-Josef-Land (today KSC Donaustadt) from the 3rd class. The merger club played in the 2nd class until 1944. Afterwards, promotion to the 1st class (2nd level) was achieved. In 1947 the merger was dissolved. After relegation, the team was unable to recover for a long time before being promoted back to the Vienna League in 1955 under President Karl Eipeldauer. In 2005 they reached their promotion to the Regionalliga East. They were relegated back to the Vienna City League as bottom of the table. After two years in the city league, they were relegated to the Vienna Oberliga B in 2008/09. SV Donau returned to the Vienna City League after two years through the merger with SV SÃ¼ssenbrunn. In the 2015/16 season the fighting team reached second place in the table. This was enough for promotion, so SV Donau has been competing in the Vienna City League since the 2017/18 season. In the 2021/22 season promotion to the Regionalliga East was narrowly missed. ==Famous players== * Johann Sock * Heinz Binder * Ferdinand Milanovich * Walter Dannhauser * Josef Sara * Robert Sara * Willi Kreuz * Marco Djuricin * Sasa Kalajdzic ==Other websites== SV Donau Homepage Category:Austrian football clubs Category:Football clubs of Vienna Category:1910 establishments in Europe Category:1910s establishments in Austria",
