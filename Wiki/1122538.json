 "text": "Andinobates dorisswansonae is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.28-17.1 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog 17.54-19.43 mm. This frog has very large eyes. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The skin of the frog's back, neck, front, and part of the belly is dark brown or black with red or yellow-orange marks. The legs are black or red-black-brown and sometimes have red spots. There is a red mark over the mouth, from the nose to where the front leg meets the body. This frog has only four toes on each foot. The first toe and the second toe grow together until they look almost like one toe. Almost no other frogs have feet like this. ==Name== Scientists named this frog after Dale Swanson, a person from Spokane, Washington. Swanson worked to protect plants and animals in the Andes Mountains for many years. ==Home== People have seen this frog in cloud forest that was once cut down and grew back. The trees had many smaller plants growing on them, and moss, lichen, and fungus. These forests have 2,500â€“3,000 mm of falling rain each year. People have seen this frog between 1780 meters above sea level. This frog lives on the ground where there are dead leaves and up in the trees where the bromeliad plants grow. Scientists think that the tadpoles may swim in water in bromeliad plants. The place where this frog lives is in a protected park: Ranita Dorada Reserve. But this place has cow- grazing places all around it, so the frog cannot move to other forests. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because people people cut down forests to make places for cows to eat grass and to get wood to build with. People also catch this frog to sell as a pet. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
