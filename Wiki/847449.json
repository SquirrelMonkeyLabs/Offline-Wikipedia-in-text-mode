 "text": "A wild man of the woods, also known as a wild man of the jungle, wild man of the forest, woodwose, wodewose or wereape or simply a wild man, is a legendary creature that painters and artists in medieval Europe would put in their artwork. It was always shown as man covered with hair. The image of a wild man were used for coats-of-arms, especially in Germany. Renaissance engravers in Germany and Italy added wild men, wild women and wild families to art (for example, Albrecht DÃ¼rer or Holbein the Younger). == References == Category:Art",
