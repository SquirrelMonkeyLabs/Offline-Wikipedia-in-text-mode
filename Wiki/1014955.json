 "text": "Deal with the Devil or a Faustian bargain, also known as a Faustian deal or Faustian pact, is a metaphor in English for a deal in which an ambitious person surrenders moral integrity in order to achieve power and success. The term originates from the legend of Faust, a character in German folklore and literature, who makes a deal with the devil for knowledge and worldly pleasures but pays the ultimate price of his soul. In a broader sense, a Faustian bargain can refer to any deal or agreement in which someone sacrifices their principles or values for material gain or advantage. It's often used to describe situations where the long-term cost of the deal is much greater than the immediate benefits. Category:Witchcraft",
