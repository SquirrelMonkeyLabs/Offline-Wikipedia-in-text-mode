 "text": "The Graduate is a 1967 American movie based on a novel by Charles Webb, and directed by Mike Nichols. It is set in Southern California. In the movie and book, a recent college graduate (played by Dustin Hoffman) is seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's business partner. He later falls in love with their daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross). The movie was Hoffman's first major role (it was his second role). He was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. The soundtrack album contained music by folk duo Simon and Garfunkel, and replaced The Beatles's White Album for the number one position (most sales) on the music charts. Scenes from The Graduate have been well-remembered by many people, since it appeared. In one of them, one-word advice for corporate success (\"Plastics\") is given by a family friend of Benjamin's. (Reportedly, sales of stock in plastics companies jumped in the months after the movie appeared.) Another scene, where Ben tries to stop Elaine from marrying another man, has been imitated and parodied in television programs, including the cartoon series Daria. In 1998, a play based on the movie premiered in London and on Broadway; its stars included Kathleen Turner, Alicia Silverstone and Morgan Fairchild. ==Cast== *Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson *Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin Braddock *Katharine Ross as Elaine Robinson *William Daniels as Mr. Braddock *Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson *Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs. Braddock *Buck Henry as Hotel Clerk *Walter Brooke as Mr. McGuire *Brian Avery as Carl Smith *Norman Fell as Mr. McCleery *Marion Lorne as Singleman party guest *Alice Ghostley as Singleman party guest Uncredited: *Mike Farrell as a bellhop at the hotel *Richard Dreyfuss as Boarding House Resident *Ben Murphy as the shaving student in the fraternity house *Kevin Tighe as Carter, Carl Smith's fraternity brother *Eve McVeagh as party guest *Hamilton Camp as Second Hotel Clerk *Donald F.
