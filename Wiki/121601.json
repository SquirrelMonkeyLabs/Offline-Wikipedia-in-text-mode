 "text": "Fire Emblem is a series of video games made by Intelligent Systems. Nintendo began publishing the series on the NES console in 1990. The first six games were only released in Japan. Fire Emblem: The Blazing Sword was the first game to be released in North America and Europe. The series is a collection of turn-based strategy role-playing games. They used many characters going on a long journey to fight a common enemy. ==Gameplay== In Fire Emblem, the player moves units across a grid in turns. The player must deal with a challenge with each part in the story, for example, defeating all of the enemy units. A player may choose to fight, move, heal, or visit shops each turn. The battle system is made up of two units fighting each other with their selected weapon. Some weapons are better against others. For example, swords are better against axes. When units defeat others, they gain experience. This experience is used to \"level up\" the units and makes them stronger. A well known feature in Fire Emblem is that when a character is damaged very badly (loses all of their \"hit points\"), they can never be used in the game again. ==Setting== Each Fire Emblem game is mainly set on a fictional continent, or a really large area. Some continents are used in more than one game. Six continents have been used in Fire Emblem so far.GameSpot: Fire Emblem Union Continent Game Akaneia Ankoku Ryū to Hikari no Tsurugi - Monshō no Nazo Barensia Gaiden Jugdral Seisen no Keifu - Tharacia 776 Elibe Fūin no Tsurugi - Blazing Sword Magvel Sacred Stones Tellius Path of Radiance - Radiant Dawn ==Games== The first six games were released only in Japan.
