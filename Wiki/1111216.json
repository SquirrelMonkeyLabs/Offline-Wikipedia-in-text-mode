 "text": "François Mansart (; 23 January 1598 – 23 September 1666) was a French architect. He introduced classicism into Baroque architecture of France. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, he was the most accomplished French architect from the 1600s. Mansart made the mansard roof popular.AMHER, 4th edition, 2000. == Career == Mansart was popular after the 1620s because of his style and skill as an architect. People thought he was stubborn and a perfectionist. Sometimes, he would tear down his buildings and start over. His works were very expensive. Only the richest could afford them. His only surviving early work is the Château de Balleroy. This was commissioned by a chancellor to Gaston, Duke of Orléans. The duke liked the building so much that he asked Mansart to renovate his Château de Blois (1635). Mansart wanted to rebuild the entire house, but he was not able to finish. In 1632, Mansart designed the Church of St. Mary of the Angels. He used the Pantheon in Rome as an inspiration. Most of Mansart's buildings were reconstructed or destroyed. In the 1640s, Mansart worked on the convent and church of the Val-de-Grâce in Paris. In the 1650s, Mansart was targeted by enemies of the prime minister Cardinal Mazarin. Mansart worked for Cardinal Mazarin ofen. In 1651, Mazarin's enemies published \"La Mansarade\". This pamphlet falsely accused Mansart of many things. After Louis XIV became the king, Mansart lost many commissions. He had plans to remodel the Louvre and the royal mausoleum at Saint-Denis. These buildings were never remodeled. Mansart died in Paris in 1666. == Gallery == File:Chateau_de_Balleroy.JPG|The Château de Balleroy, Mansart's earliest surviving work File:Temple_Sainte-Marie_rue_Saint-Antoine_4.jpg|The Church of the Visitation in the Rue Saint-Antoine, now the Temple du MaraisBraham and Smith 1973, pp. 203–205.
