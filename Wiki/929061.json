 "text": "The National Rifle Association of New Zealand (NRA) is the national governing body for Fullbore rifle shooting in New Zealand. The Association is the member for New Zealand at the International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations (ICFRA) and takes part in ICFRA World Championships and the Commonwealth Games. ==History== The NRA started as the New Zealand Rifle Association (NZRA) in 1878. It ran the national competition each year. The Government Volunteer Movement had run the competition since 1861 but gave it to the NZRA. By 1900 the NZRA had trouble with money because they built a new shooting range for the competition each year in a different place. The NZRA was taken over by the Defence Force and was called the New Zealand Defence Rifle Association. In 1923, the National Rifle Association was formed to separate the target shooters from the military Defence Force. ==Related pages== * New Zealand Shooting Federation * International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Rifle associations Category:1878 establishments Category:Sports organizations of New Zealand",
