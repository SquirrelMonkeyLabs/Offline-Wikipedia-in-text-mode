 "text": "Rubber Soul is the sixth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 3 December 1965 in the United Kingdom, on EMI's Parlophone label. The double A-side single \"Day Tripper\" / \"We Can Work It Out\" was released at the same time. The first North American version of the album from Capitol Records had ten of the fourteen songs from the British Parlophone version. Rubber Soul was very popular with critics. It was at the top of sales charts in Britain and the United States for many weeks. The album proves the Beatles were starting to use LSD and marijuana. The album was recorded in London over four weeks in October-November 1965. Most call it a folk rock album, especially in its Capitol (North American) version. Rubber Soul has a mix of pop, soul and folk musical styles. The songs show the Beatles' improving as songwriters. They also used brighter guitar tones and new instrumentation such as sitar, harmonium and fuzz bass. ==Track listing== ===Everywhere except North America=== ===North America=== ==Sources== * ==References== Category:The Beatles albums Category:1965 albums Category:Folk albums Category:Pop rock albums",
