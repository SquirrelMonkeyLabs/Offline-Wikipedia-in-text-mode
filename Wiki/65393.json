 "text": "Henry Clay, Sr. (April 12, 1777 – June 29, 1852) was an American politician from Kentucky. He served in the House of Representatives (as Speaker) and the Senate and was Secretary of State. He ran for President several times but never won. He wanted the United States to fight the British during the War of 1812. After years in the Democratic-Republican Party, he started the Whig Party to oppose Andrew Jackson. He helped pass the famous compromises over slavery leading up the Civil War, including the 1820 Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850. He is considered to be one of the greatest Senators in American history. ==Early life and education== ===Childhood=== Henry Clay was born on April 12, 1777, at the Clay farmhouse in Hanover County, Virginia, in a story-and-a-half frame house. It was an above-average home for a common Virginia planter of the time. At the time of his death, Clay's father owned more than 22 slaves, making him part of the planter class in Virginia (those men who owned 20 or more slaves). He also ate much cabbage to survive the cold winter months. Henry was the seventh of nine children of Reverend John Clay and Elizabeth Hudson Clay.Van Deusen, 4. His father, a Baptist minister nicknamed \"Sir John,\" died four years after his birth in 1781. The father left Henry and his brothers two slaves each, and his wife 18 slaves and of land. Henry was a second cousin of Cassius Marcellus Clay, who became an abolitionist in Kentucky. The widow Elizabeth Clay married Capt. Henry Watkins, who was a loving stepfather. Henry Watkins then moved the family to Richmond, Virginia.\"Henry Clay\", Encyclopedia of World Biography. Elizabeth had seven more children with Watkins, who had sixteen. ===Education=== His stepfather secured Clay employment in the office of the Virginia Court of Chancery, where he showed a skill for law. There, he became friends with George Wythe, who chose Clay as his secretary. After Clay was employed as Wythe's faculty for four years, the chancellor took an active interest in Clay's future and arranged a position for him with the Virginia attorney general, Robert Brooke. Clay received no formal legal education but, as was customary at the time, \"read law\" by working and studying with Wythe, Chancellor of the Commonwealth of Virginia (also a mentor to Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall, among others), and Brooke. Clay was admitted to practice law in 1797. ===Marriage and family=== After starting his law career, on April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in Lexington, Kentucky. She was a sister to Captain Nathaniel G. S. Hart, who died in the Massacre of the River Raisin in the War of 1812. Clay and his wife had eleven children (six daughters and five sons): Henrietta (1800–1801), Theodore (1802–1870), Thomas (1803–1871), Susan (1805–1825), Anne (1807–1835), Lucretia (1809–1823), Henry, Jr. (1811–1847), Eliza (1813–1825), Laura (1815–1817), James Brown, (1817–1864), and John (1821–1887). Seven of Clay's children died before him and his wife. By 1835, all six daughters had died of many conditions, two when very young, two as children and the other two as young women, from whooping cough, yellow fever, and complications of childbirth. The only remaining son, Henry Clay, Jr., was killed at the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican- American War. Lucretia Hart Clay died in 1864 at the age of 83. She is buried with her husband in Lexington Cemetery. Henry and Lucretia Clay were great- grandparents of the suffragette Madeline McDowell Breckinridge, a family member of John C. Breckinridge, who was Vice President of the United States during James Buchanan's presidency. ==References== Category:1777 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Democratic-Republican Party politicians Category:National Republican Party politicians Category:Politicians from Virginia Category:Speakers of the United States House of Representatives Category:United States representatives from Kentucky Category:United States Secretaries of State Category:United States senators from Kentucky Category:Whig Party (United States) politicians Category:19th-century American politicians",
