 "text": "A Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) is a type of health clinic in the United States. These centers receive money from the federal government. They use this money to give healthcare to people who may not have much money or health insurance. FQHCs provide many types of care. They help people when they are sick and also help prevent illness. Most centers offer medical, dental, and mental health services. Some also give care to pregnant women and children. Many centers give vaccines, health education, and help with getting medicine. People pay based on what they can afford. This is called a \"sliding fee scale.\" These centers are open to everyone. They give care to people who do not have health insurance. They help people with low incomes. They are also important in rural areas or neighborhoods where it is hard to find a doctor. To be called an FQHC, a clinic must follow rules made by the federal government. It must have a board of directors, and some of the people on the board must be patients. The clinic must also give reports to the government and meet quality standards. The first FQHCs started in the 1960s. They were part of a program to fight poverty in the United States. Today, there are thousands of FQHCs across the country. They help around 30 million people in the country each year. These clinics are an important part of the public health system in the United States. == References == Category:Healthcare in the United States",
