 "text": "An archivist is a professional who collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to information determined to have long-term value. The information maintained by an archivist can be any form of media (photographs, video or sound recordings, letters, documents, electronic records, etc.). As Richard Pearce-Moses wrote, \"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records.\" Pearce-Moses, Richard. \"Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?\" Archival Outlook, March/April 2006. Determining what records have enduring value is not always easy. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service. The theory and scholarly work underpinning archives practices is called archival science. ==Related pages== * Archive * Librarian * Manuscript * Preservation ==Footnotes== ==Other websites== * Archives and Records Association of New Zealand * Society of American Archivists * Directory of Regional, State and Local Archival Organizations in the United States * Association of Canadian Archivists * Society of Archivists (UK and Ireland) * Australian Society of Archivists * Česká archivní společnost / Czech Archive Society (In English) * International Council on Archives * The Archivist's Toolkit an online tool for archivists Category:Occupations",
