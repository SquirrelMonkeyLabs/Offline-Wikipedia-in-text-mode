At the now-deserted border town of Lachin, which gives the corridor its name, the distance between Armenia and Nagorno- Karabakh is a mere six kilometer The territory of the corridor today consists of three settlements: the villages of Zabukh, Sus and the city of Lachin. After the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994, the area was occupied by the Nagorno- Karabakh Republic. Following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war it was controlled by Russian peacekeepers. In 2023, Armenia took control of Artsakh/Nagorno- Karabakh. Almost all the Armenians in Artsakh left through the Lachin corridor to Armenia. == References == Category:Nagorno-Karabakh",
