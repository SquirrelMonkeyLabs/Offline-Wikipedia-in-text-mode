 "text": "Distribution is a concept from algebra: It tells how binary operations are to be handled. The most simple case is that of addition and multiplication of numbers. For example, in arithmetic: : 2 ⋅ (1 + 3) = (2 ⋅ 1) + (2 ⋅ 3), but 2 / (1 + 3) ≠ (2 / 1) + (2 / 3). In the left-hand side of the first equation, the 2 multiplies the sum of 1 and 3; on the right-hand side, it multiplies the 1 and the 3 individually, with the products added afterwards. Because these give the same final answer (8), it is said that multiplication by 2 distributes over addition of 1 and 3. Since one could have put any real numbers in place of 2, 1, and 3 above, and still have obtained a true equation, we say that multiplication of real numbers distributes over addition of real numbers. ==Definition== Given a set S and two binary operators ∗ and + on S, we say that the operation: ∗ is left-distributive over + if, given any elements x,y, and z of S, ::x*(y+z)=(x*y)+(x*z), ∗ is right-distributive over + if, given any elements x,y, and z of S, ::(y+z)*x=(y*x)+(z*x), and ∗ is distributive over + if it is left- and right-distributive.Ayres, p. 20 Notice that when ∗ is commutative, the three conditions above are logically equivalent. == Applications == The distributive property can also be applied to: * Real numbers * Complex numbers * Matrices (special rules apply) * Vectors (special rules apply) * Sets *Propositional logic ==References== * Ayres, Frank, Schaum's Outline of Modern Abstract Algebra, McGraw-Hill; 1st edition (June 1, 1965). .
