The USB-C specifications were first published and finalized in August of 2014, roughly the same time as USB 3.1 specifications. It is both smaller and faster than USB-A. The USB-C 3.1 has the potential to have higher data transfer speeds. It can also deliver 100 watts of power over a single cable (this is done by upping the voltage to 20 volts). == References == Category:USB",
