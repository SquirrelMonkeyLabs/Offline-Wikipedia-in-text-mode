However this does not include the Montreal Football Club that was formed in 1872, and joined the IRFU in 1907–1915, and the Montreal AAA Winged Wheelers, who played in the IRFU during the 1930s and 40's, winning the Grey Cup in 1931. # All Ottawa clubs including the previous Rough Riders and Renegades are combined with current Redblacks for historical consistency only, even though the CFL considers them separate clubs. # While football in Edmonton was first played in 1890,2009 Canadian Football League Facts, Figures & Records, Canadian Football League Properties/Publications, Toronto, Ontario, , p.282 the Edmonton Elks (in their current incarnation) recognize their first season in 1949.

Roughriders were originally called the Regina Rugby Football club from 1910 to 1924. then called the Regina Roughriders from 1925 to 1949. # Created by a merger of the Winnipegs and the St. John's team on June 10, 1930, and become known as the \"Winnipeg Pegs\" before changing to the current name, Blue Bombers, in 1937. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1958 establishments in North America Category:Canadian football Category:1950s establishments in Canada",
