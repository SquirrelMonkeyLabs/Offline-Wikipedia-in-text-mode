Retrieved 2024-11-12 Mukhtar Babayev will be the president of the conference: he is a government minister and used to work for Azerbaijan's national oil company SOCAR. == Complaints == Some people say that having COP29 in Azerbaijan is a bad thing because the government does bad things to people, like putting journalists in prison and political corruption. But other people say that, because lots of foreign people will be looking at Azerbaijan during COP29, the government will be embarrassed about doing bad things to people. Some people say that the government has damaged its own environment, and is just pretending to care. Azerbaijan gets a lot of money by selling oil and gas to other countries. === No women at first, in the climate committee of COP29 === The conference's committee had 28 people at first, all men. After Christiana Figueres, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and other people complained, another two men and eleven women were added. == Related pages== *Kyoto Protocol *Conference of the parties (or COP) == References == Category:Climate change Category:2020s in Azerbaijan Category:2024 in Asia",
