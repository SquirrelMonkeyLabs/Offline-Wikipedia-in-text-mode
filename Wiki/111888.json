 "text": "Olaf Kölzig (born April 6, 1970) is a South African-born German retired professional ice hockey goaltender. He played a career total of 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Washington Capitals and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Kölzig was born in South Africa, but he grew up in several cities across Canada and his family moved to Union Bay, British Columbia, Canada, when he was a teenager. Kölzig never applied for Canadian citizenship, which, combined with his German parentage and German passport, allows him to represent Germany internationally. In May 2008 Kolzig announced that he would not return to the Capitals. ==References== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Baltimore Skipjacks players Category:German ice hockey players Category:Olympians for Germany Category:New Westminster Bruins players Category:Portland Pirates players Category:Rochester Americans players Category:Sportspeople from Johannesburg Category:Tampa Bay Lightning players Category:Tri-City Americans players Category:Vezina Trophy winners Category:Washington Capitals players Category:ECHL players Category:Ice hockey goaltenders",
