 "text": "The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, also called the San Felipe hurricane, was a very bad tropical cyclone. Almost 4,100 people died in the northeast Caribbean, Puerto Rico and southeast Florida to North Carolina. This hurricane had wind close to Category 5 level when it hit Puerto Rico, when it was also a large hurricane. Over 2,500 people died in the United States, making the storm one of the deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history at that time. It struck Florida at Category 4 levels. The hurricane hit the coast in Palm Beach County, Florida and damaged many buildings. But then it went inland. It caused the waters of Lake Okeechobee to rise ten feet. The lake flooded 75 miles of Florida. Because people were not prepared for the flood, many died. Dead bodies lay in the hot Florida sun for days. Sometimes whole families were killed, so no one was left to identify the bodies. After the hurricane, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a large dike near Lake Okechobee to stop future floods. 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane Formed August 3 Dissipated September 6 Highest winds 160 mph Areas Affected Lesser Antilles Puerto Rico Hispaniola Bahamas Florida Georgia the Carolinas. ==Related pages== *Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale, showing the difference between different categories of hurricanes *Hurricane Maria ==References== Okeecho Category:1920s in Florida Category:20th century in Puerto Rico Category:20th century in North Carolina Category:Hurricanes in Florida Category:Natural disasters in the United States Category:Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Category:Deadly storms",
