This carbon atom must also have single bonds to two other carbon atoms. A ketone can be produced by oxidating a secondary alcohol. Spectroscopy: A ketone will show a strong peak between 1690 and 1715cm-1 using infrared spectroscopy.Padias, Anne. Making the Connections: A How-to guide for Organic Chemistry Lab Techniques. 2nd.
