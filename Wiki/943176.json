 "text": "USAir Flight 1016 was a US domestic flight between Columbia, South Carolina and Charlotte, North Carolina. On July 2, 1994, the DC-9 operating the flight encountered a severe thunderstorm and microbursts, which induced wind shear while attempting to land, causing the plane to crash into trees and a private residence near the airport. The accident and subsequent fire killed 37 people and injured 16 others. ==Investigation== The NTSB immediately dispatched an investigation team, which recovered the CVR and FDR from the plane's wreckage. After a lengthy investigation, the NTSB concluded that a microburst generated by the thunderstorm over the airport at the time of the crash was the probable cause of the accident. The NTSB listed these contributing factors: #The flight crew's decision to continue an approach to an area where a microburst was likely. #The failure of the flight crew to recognize wind shear quickly (exacerbated by an error in the wind shear alert software; the wind shear alert system should have warned them about 8–9 seconds prior to impact) #The failure of the flight crew to establish proper pitch and engine power that would have brought them out of the wind shear #The lack of timely weather information by air traffic control to the crew of Flight 1016 == References == ==Other websites== *Sudden Impact — A Flight Attendant's Story of Courage and Survival *Interview with Richard DeMary, flight attendant aboard flight 1016 (Archive) *Photo of N954VJ, prior to the crash * *NTSB investigation docket Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the 1990s Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:1994 disasters Category:1994 in the United States",
