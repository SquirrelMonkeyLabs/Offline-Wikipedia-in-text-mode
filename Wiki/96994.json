 "text": "Maximilian Carl Emil Weber (pronounced: maks ˈveːbɐ) (21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920) was a German political economist and sociologist who was considered one of the founders of the modern study of sociology and public administration. ==Works== He began his career at the University of Berlin, and later worked at Freiburg University, University of Heidelberg, University of Vienna and University of Munich. He had influence on German politics of his time, because he was an advisor to Germany's negotiators at the Treaty of Versailles and to the commission that drafted the Weimar Constitution. Weber is known for his work in the sociology of religion. His most famous work is his essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. He disagreed with Karl Marx's view that class structure was the way to view how society worked. He believed that human values affected how people acted throughout history. ==Related pages== *List of sociologists from Europe == Other websites == ;Texts of Weber works: * Large collection of the German original texts * Large collection of the German original texts * Large collection of English translations * Another collection of English translations * A comprehensive collection of English translations and secondary literature * English translations of many of Weber's works, merged into one very long unformatted file * Max Weber Reference Archive ; About Weber: * Biography entry and link section * Weber on Ideal Types * Max Weber – The person * More of Weber on Ideal Types * An essay on Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science * Max Weber: On Capitalism As above, but on capitalism * Some of Weber concepts in the form of a list * Max Weber's HomePage \"A site for undergraduates\" * Mises versus Weber on Bureaucracy and Sociological Method by William P.
