Together with the Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, Protestantism became the third-largest force in Christianity. Protestantism has a significant impact on the culture, beliefs and economy of a place where it became important.

Total depravity: Morris, J.W., The Historic Church: An Orthodox View of Christian History, p267, \"The Book of Concord became the official statement of doctrine for most of the world's Lutherans. The Formula of Concord reaffirmed the traditional Lutheran doctrine of total depravity in very clear terms\"Melton, J.G., Encyclopedia of Protestantism, p229, on Formula of Concord, \"the 12 articles of the formula focused on a number of newer issues such as original sin (in which total depravity is affirmed)\" Everyone has free will in regard to \"goods and possessions\", but is sinful by nature and unable to contribute to its own salvation.* * Augsburg Confessional, Article XVIII, Of Free Will , saying: \"(M)an's will has some liberty to choose civil righteousness, and to work things subject to reason. But it has no power, without the Holy Ghost, to work the righteousness of God, that is, spiritual righteousness; since the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 2:14); but this righteousness is wrought in the heart when the Holy Ghost is received through the Word.\" * Henry Cole, trans., Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 66. The controversial term liberum arbitrium was translated \"free-will\" by Cole. However Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson, Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation (Westminster, 1969) chose \"free choice\" as their translation. Total depravity: Everyone has the freedom from necessity, but not \"freedom from sin\" unless enabled by \"prevenient grace\". Election Unconditional election. Unconditional election.The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Lutheran Church, XI. Election. \"Predestination\" means \"God's ordination to salvation\". Conditional election in view of foreseen faith or unbelief. Justification and atonement Justification by faith alone. Controversies exist about the extent of the atonement.The Westminster Confession, III:6, says that only the \"elect\" are \"effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved.\" However in his Calvin and the Reformed Tradition (Baker, 2012), 45, Richard A. Muller observes that \"a sizeable body of literature has interpreted Calvin as teaching \"limited atonement\", but \"an equally sizeable body . . . [interprets] Calvin as teaching \"unlimited atonement\". Justification for all men, * completed at Christ's death and effective through faith alone. * * * * Augsburg Confession, Article V, Of Justification. People \"cannot be justified before God by their own strength, merits, or works, but are freely justified for Christ's sake, through faith, when they believe that they are received into favor, and that their sins are forgiven for Christ's sake. ...\" Justification is made possible for everyone via Christ's death, but only completed upon choosing faith in Jesus. Conversion Monergistic,Paul ChulHong Kang, Justification: The Imputation of Christ's Righteousness from Reformation Theology to the American Great Awakening and the Korean Revivals (Peter Lang, 2006), 70, note 171. Calvin generally defends Augustine's \"monergistic view\". by means of grace, and irresistible. Monergistic,Monergism; thefreedictionary.com through the means of grace, and resistible. Synergistic and resistible due to the common grace of free will. Perseverance and apostasy Perseverance of the saints: the eternally elect in Christ will certainly persevere in faith.The Westminster Confession of Faith, Ch XVII, \"Of the Perseverance of the Saints\". Falling away is possible, but God gives gospel assurance. Preservation is conditional upon continued faith in Christ, with the chance of a final apostasy. ==Related pages== * Catholicism * Protestantism ** Baptist ** Calvinism ** Anglicanism ** Lutheranism * Eastern Christianity ** Greek Orthodox Church ** Eastern Orthodox Church ** Orthodox Church of Ukraine * Oriental Orthodoxy ** Armenian Apostolic Church ** Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria ==References== Category:Protestantism Category:History of Europe Category:Protestant Reformation Category:History of Christianity Category:Protestant denominations",
