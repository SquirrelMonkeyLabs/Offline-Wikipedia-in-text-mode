Its footage was used in Power Rangers Lost Galaxy. ==Plot== Three thousand years ago, the Space Pirates Balban invaded Earth. The Starbeasts and the first Gingamen, warrios of the Ginga Forest, fought them with a mystical power known as Earth and eventually imprisoned them. The Ginga people later cloaked their forest within marked boundaries and passed on the duty of the Ginga warriors through generations. In the present day, Hyuuga, Hayate, Gouki, Hikaru and Saya are chosen as the 133rd warriors of the Starbeast Swords. Ryouma is very happy that his elder brother Hyuuga succeeds to the title. When Orghi holds the succession ceremony of the Starbeast Swords, an earthquake breaks the seal on the Balban. Orghi orders the 133rd warriors to get the Ginga Braces hidden in Roaring Mountain. However, the Balban attacks them to prevent the birth of the new Gingamen. During the battle, Hyuuga is swallowed into a crack in the ground created by the Balban's leader, Captain Zahab. Enraged, Ryouma activates his hidden Earth power and awakens the Ginga Braces. The Gingamen fight together with the Starbeasts against the Balban, who desire to revive the Demon Beast Daitanix, on whose corpse they built their castle. ==Characters== ===Gingaman=== Actor Name Rangers Mecha Kazuki Maehara Ryouma Ginga Red Starbeast Ginga Leon Koji Sueyoshi Hayate Ginga Green Starbeast Gingalcon Shouei Gouki Ginga Blue Starbeast Gingarilla Nobuaki Takahashi Hikaru Ginga Yellow Starbeast Ginga Verick Juri Miyazawa Saya Ginga Pink Starbeast Gingat Teruaki Ogawa Hyuuga Black Knight Heavy Starbeast Gou Taurus ==Cast== * Ryouma / Ginga Red: Kazuki Maehara * Hayate / Ginga Green: Koji Sueyoshi * Gouki / Ginga Blue: Shōei * Hikaru / Ginga Yellow: Nobuaki Takahashi * Saya / Ginga Pink, Misaki Hoshino (Episode 14): Juri Miyazawa * Hyūga / Black Knight: Teruaki Ogawa * Haruhiko Aoyama: Yoshihiko Takamoku * Yūta Aoyama: Shōgo Hayakawa * Suzuko Mizusawa: Makiko Yoshida * Shunsuke Kishimoto: Yūji Kishi * Ohgri: Hiroshi Arikawa * Miharu: Noriko Tanaka ==Songs== ;Opening theme * \"Seijū Sentai Gingaman\" **Lyrics: Shoko Fujibayashi **Composition & Arrangement: Toshihiko Sasashi **Artist: Ryū Kisami ;Ending theme * \"Free Mind\" **Lyrics: Shoko Fujibayashi **Composition: Masao Ideguchi **Arrangement: Kōichirō Kameyama **Artist: Ryū Kisami Category:Super Sentai series Category:1998 television series debuts Category:1999 television series endings",
