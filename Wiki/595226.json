She was a member of Georges Lamarque's \"Druids\" network. Rousseau was born in Saint-Brieuc, France. Codenamed AMNIARIX, she evaded Gestapo agents while gathering crucial information on the Germans' emerging rocket weapons programs from behind enemy lines. Her intelligence reports, forwarded to London, led directly to the British raid on Peenemünde and to delays and disruptions in the V-1 and V-2 programs, saving many thousands of lives in the West. Rousseau was captured twice and spent time in three concentration camps.CIA web site, Honoring Two World War II Heroes Rousseau died on 23 August 2017 in Montaigu, France, aged 98. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:2017 deaths Category:French people of World War II Category:Spies Category:People from Saint-Brieuc",
