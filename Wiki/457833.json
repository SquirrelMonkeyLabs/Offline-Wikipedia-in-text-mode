 "text": "The tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), also known as the Mindoro dwarf buffalo, is a small, hoofed mammal. It is found only on the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. The tamaraw was originally more widely spread. Because of human habitation, hunting, and logging, it is present in only a few remote grassy plains and is now an endangered species. ==References== Category:Bovines Category:Mammals of Asia",
