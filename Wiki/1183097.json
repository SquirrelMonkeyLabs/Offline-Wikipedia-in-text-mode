In addition to Honduras, Garifuna populations can be found in Guatemala (approximately 15,000 people), Belize (around 35,000 people), and Nicaragua (about 10,000 people). It is widely Recognized as the national dance of Honduras, symbolizing resilience, Identity, and pride. Punta has its origins on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Honduras after it was brought to the Honduran department of Roat√°n in 1797, where it evolved, blending local Honduran cultural influences with Garifuna African and Arawak elements. Punta is a vibrant representation of the community's heritage. It is also referred to as Banguity or Bunda. Category:Music genres",
