 "text": "A fan club is an organized group of fans, generally of a celebrity. Most fan clubs are run by fans who spend time and money to support them. There are also \"official\" fan clubs. They are run by someone associated with the person or organization the club is centered on. Many musicians and sports teams have official fan clubs. Sometimes people have to pay to join the club. Social media have helped more fan clubs to grow. People in a fan club often have a T-shirt or a badge to show they are a part of it. They often have merchandise that is given or sold to fans. Barbz, who support Nicki Minaj, Hollanders, who support Tom Holland, Carats, who support Seventeen, and Swifties who support Taylor Swift are examples of fan clubs. ==References== Category:Fandom",
