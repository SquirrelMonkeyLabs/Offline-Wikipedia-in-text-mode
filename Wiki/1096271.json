 "text": "17 is the first studio album by American rapper, XXXTentacion. 17 was released on August 25, 2017. While in prison, X announced the albums 17, I Need Jesus, and Members Only, Vol. 3. X would announce that the release of 17 would come after the release of his group, Members Only's mixtape Members Only, Vol. 3. X said that the album was a 'gateway' into his mind and made songs with themes of suicide and depression. X would cause some controversy when he posted a video of himself to Instagram appearing to hang himself from a tree. He would later apologize and say that the \"hanging\" was a scene for a music video. The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 and selling album-equivalent units. After X's murder, the album would re-enter the Billboard 200 at #7 and sold 55,000 album-equivalent units. 17 would be three times Platinum. The album featured the singles \"Revenge\", \"Jocelyn Flores\", and \"Fuck Love\". ==Songs== ==References== Category:2017 albums Category:XXXTentacion albums Category:Debut albums Category:Empire Distribution albums",
