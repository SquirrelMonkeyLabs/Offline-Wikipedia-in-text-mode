 "text": "In the United States, despite the efforts of equality proponents, income inequality persists among races and ethnicities. Asian Americans have the highest pay, followed by European Americans, Middle Eastern and North African Americans, Hispanic Americans, other African Americans, and Native Americans. A variety of explanations for these differences have been suggested—such as different access to education, two parent home family structure (70% of African American children are born to parents who are not legally married), high school dropout rates and experience of discrimination and deep-seated and systemic anti-Black racism—and the topic is highly controversial. When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, it became illegal for employers to discriminate based on race; however, differences in pay have not flattened out. After the passage of the act, the wage gap for minority groups narrowed, both in absolute difference with white wages and as a percentage of white wages, until the mid-1970s; at this time, progress for many racial minorities slowed, stopped, or reversed. As of 2009, the median weekly wage for all African American (except for North African Americans) and Hispanic workers was about 65 percent and 61 percent that of white workers, respectively. Asian workers' median wage was about 110 percent that of white workers. ==Related pages== *Income inequality in the United States *Wealth inequality in the United States ==References== Category:Economy of the United States Category:Race",
