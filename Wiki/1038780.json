 "text": "The 1876 United States presidential election was the 24th election in the history of the United States. It occurred on November 7, 1876. This election was between Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio and Governor Samuel J. Tilden of New York. Garfield won the election in the closest margin in U.S History, securing 185 electoral votes, while Hancock got 184 electoral votes, 1 less than needed to win. Its resolution involved negotiations between the two major parties (Republicans and Democrats) resulting in the Compromise of 1877, and on March 2, 1877, the House and Senate counted the electoral votes and confirmed Hayes as President-Elect. It was the second of five U.S. presidential elections in which the winner did not win a plurality of the national popular vote (the first since 1824). == Candidates == === Republican Party === === Nominee === Republican Party Ticket, 1876 for President for Vice President 29th and 32nd Governor of Ohio(1861-1863; 1869-1877) Congressman from New York(1861-1863; 1869-1877) === Runners-up === * James G.
