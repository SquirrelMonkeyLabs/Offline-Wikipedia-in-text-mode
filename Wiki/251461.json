 "text": "The greater bulldog bat or fisherman bat (Noctilio leporinus) of South America hunts for its food using sound. It makes a high clicking noise that hits ripples in the water. By listening for the echoes, the bat can tell not only where the ripples are, but also locate the fish that made them. == References == Category:Bats Category:Mammals of North America Category:Mammals of South America",
