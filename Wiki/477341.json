It consisted of the separate kingdoms of Sweden and Norway under the same monarch. It lasted from 1814 to 1905. In 1905 Sweden accepted Norway leaving the union. Both states kept their separate constitutions, laws, legislatures, administrations, state churches, armed forces, and currencies. However the kings mostly resided in Stockholm.
