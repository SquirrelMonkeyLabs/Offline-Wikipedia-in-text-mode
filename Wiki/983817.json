 "text": "The Hungarian algorithm produces the best distribution, with for example: lowest price or shortest time. ==Best distribution== Example: Driver Electrician Gardener Manager Alex $8 $9 $98 $23 Ben $11 $69 $5 $86 Chris $20 $21 $7 $30 Dave $47 $7 $19 $62 Lowest price: * $23: Alex - manager * $11: Ben - driver * $7: Chris - gardener. * $7: Dave - electrician. $48: Total ==Steps== The Hungarian Matrix plays with values until the best distribution has only zeroes. ===Step 1, zero in every line left to right=== Decrease each left to right line with its lowest value. * first line: - 8 * second line: -5 * third line: -7 * fourth line: -7. ===Step 2, zero in every top down line=== Decrease each top down line with its lowest value, - 15 for last one only. ===Step 3, mark zeroes to keep=== Cover all zeroes with the lowest possible number of lines. 0 1 90 0 6 64 0 66 13 14 0 8 40 0 12 40 Find the lowest unmarked value: 6. ===Step 4, make more zeroes=== Increase all values in marked lines with the value from step 3. 6 7 102 6 6 64 6 66 13 14 6 8 46 6 24 46 Decrease all values with the value from step 3. 0 1 96 0 0 58 0 60 7 8 0 2 40 0 18 40 Do steps 3 and 4 again and again, until you have enough zeroes. ==Other websites== * hungarianalgorithm.com, step by step examples of the Hungarian Algorithm.
