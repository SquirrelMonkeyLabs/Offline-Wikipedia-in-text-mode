 "text": "Duck, duck, goose is a traditional game, three teams play outdoors. The idea of the game is simple: Everyone sits in a circle and chooses a person who, with a handkerchief in his hand, walks behind the back of the other participants while a song is played. Before the end of the song, the person walking around should throw a handkerchief on someone's back and quickly surround the other participants to take their place. During this time, the person for whom the handkerchief was thrown should get up quickly and catch the person running. If she fails, she takes the handkerchief and goes around the circle and then the cycle repeats. A simpler adaptation includes 1 group of people in a circle sitting down. 1 person walks around the circle one by one tapping people on the top of their head stating either duck or goose. If duck was said that person stays sitting, if goose is called the person who had their head tapped as goose was said stands up and attempts to catch the person walking. The person walking then starts running attempting to reach the spot that the sitting person once sat at and sit down in that spot. If the person walking manages to sit where the person was sitting before the person they called goose on catches them, they become a sitter and the person that was called goose becomes the new person walking around the circle. If the person called goose catches the person that called goose on them, they return to where they were sitting and the person caught stays as the person walking around the circle. Once the new person (including the same person) has been chosen the cycle repeats until every person has been goose at least once. Category:Games",
