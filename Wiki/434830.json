 "text": "The title Duke of Orléans is an old French Dukedom that was highly regarded whilst the country was a monarchy. The title was usually used by a younger son of a reigning King and was passed from father to son. During the reign of Louis XIV of France the title was used by his only broth Philippe who as a Son of France was known simply as Monsieur. At the death of Philippe in 1701 the Dukes only held the rank of Prince of the blood but maintained their rank due to being descended from a son of a previous king. The holder of the title was entitled to be addressed as Your Serene Highness but this was used in writing only. The present day House of Orléans is descended from this line and takes its name from the prestigious title. As princes of the blood they ranked above that of the Princes of Condé the Princes of Conti as well as the Count of Soissons. The Dukes main seat was the Palais Royal in Paris and the lavish Château de Saint Cloud outside the capital as well as countless other residences. The Duke and his wife were also entitled to their own apartment in the Palace of Versailles. ==List of Dukes== # Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans, \"Monsieur\" (10 May 1661 – 9 June 1701) - The only sibling of King Louis XIV, known simply as \"Monsieur\". #Philippe, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France (9 June 1701 – 2 December 1723) - Regent of France for the young Louis XV. # Louis, Duke of Orléans (2 December 1723 - 4 February 1752). # Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans (4 August 1752 – 18 November 1785). # Philippe Égalité (18 November 1785 – 6 November 1793) guillotined during the French Revolution. # Louis Philippe I (6 November 1793 - 9 August 1830).
