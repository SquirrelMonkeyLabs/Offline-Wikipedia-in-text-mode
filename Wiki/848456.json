 "text": "The 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup was the nineteenth edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup. It ran from 21 June to 13 July 2013. France won the tournament and their first U-20 World Cup, and thus became the first nation to win all five FIFA 11-a-side men's titles (FIFA World Cup, FIFA Confederations Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, and Olympic gold medal). == Bids == At the deadline date of 17 January 2011, three member associations confirmed they would be bidding for the event. Neither Turkey nor Uzbekistan had ever been hosts to a FIFA competition, while the United Arab Emirates were hosts of the U-20s in 2003. * Turkey * United Arab Emirates * Uzbekistan * Zimbabwe (withdrew bid) == Venues == Istanbul Kayseri Bursa Türk Telekom Arena Kadir Has Stadium Atatürk Stadium Capacity: 52,652 Capacity: 32,864 Capacity: 25,213 Trabzon Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium Capacity: 23,772 Gaziantep Rize Antalya Kamil Ocak Stadium Yeni Şehir Stadium Akdeniz University Stadium Capacity: 16,981 Capacity: 15,485 Capacity: 7,083 == Qualification == In addition to host nation Turkey, 23 nations qualified from six separate continental competitions.

Teams that made their debut. == Organization and emblem == To mark the one year countdown date to the competition, FIFA, as well as members of the Turkish FA, announced that the emblem would be presented to the media on 25 June 2012 at Ciragan Palace Mabeyn Hall in Istanbul. Details of the ticketing access were made publicly available on 30 November 2012. Host city logos for each participating stadium were shown to the general public on 20 March 2013, with each taking inspiration from their surroundings. The official logo included an Evil Eye protector, worn or hung inside Turkish homes to bring luck. == Mascot == The mascot for the tournament was called Kanki, a blue-eyed Kangal puppy. == Theme song == The official theme song for the tournament was Yıldızlar Buradan Yükseliyor, which is translated as Building Bridges for Rising Stars, performed by Turkish rock band Gece. == Draw == The final draw was held at the Grand Tarabya Hotel in Istanbul on 25 March 2013, at 19:00 local time. On 12 February 2013, FIFA announced the procedure of the draw. The 24 teams were divided into four differing pots: * Pot 1: Hosts and continental champions of five confederations (except OFC) * Pot 2: Remaining teams from AFC and CAF * Pot 3: Remaining teams from CONCACAF and CONMEBOL * Pot 4: Remaining teams from OFC and UEFA Prior to the draw, Turkey was assigned to position C1, and Spain was assigned to Group A. As a basic principle, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other at the group stage, except in Group A where there were two teams from UEFA. As the CAF U-20 Championship was not completed at the time of the draw, a separate draw took place at the tournament's conclusion on 30 March in Oran, Algeria to determine the groups where the second, third and fourth-placed CAF teams would play in. Pot 1 Pot 2 Pot 3 Pot 4 == Match officials == The 23 referee trios were announced by FIFA on 13 May 2013.

The squads were announced by FIFA on 14 June 2013. == Group stage == The winners and runners-up from each group, as well as the best four third-placed teams, qualified for the first round of the knockout stage (round of 16). The ranking of each team in each group was determined as follows: # points obtained in all group matches; # goal difference in all group matches; # number of goals scored in all group matches; If two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows: # points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned; # goal difference in the group matches between the teams concerned; # number of goals scored in the group matches between the teams concerned; # drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee. All times are local, UTC+03:00. === Group A === \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- === Group B === \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- === Group C === \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- === Group D === Note: drawing of lots was used to determine the final positions of Greece and Paraguay, as the two teams finished level on points, goal difference, goals scored, and head-to-head record. \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- === Group E === \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- === Group F === \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- === Ranking of third-placed teams === The four best teams among those ranked third were determined as follows: # points obtained in all group matches; # goal difference in all group matches; # number of goals scored in all group matches; # drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee. == Knockout stage == In the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of fifteen minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner, except for the play-off for third place, where no extra time would be played as the match was played directly before the final. {{Round16 |2 July — Gaziantep|52= (p)|59=|58=1|57= |56=6 July — Bursa|55=3 (4)|54=|53=3 (5)|51=7 July — Kayseri|61=10 July — Bursa|50=3|49=|48=4|47= |46=7 July — Istanbul|45=0|44=|60=0 |62=|42=|73=0 (4)|80=0|79=|78=3|77=|76=13 July — Istanbul|75=0 (1) |74=|72= (p)|63=2|71=13 July — Istanbul|70=1 (7) |69= (p)|68=1 (6)|67=|66=10 July — Trabzon|65=1|64=|43=4|41=6 July — Rize||11=3 July — Kayseri|18=0|17=|16=3 July — Bursa|15=3|14=|13=2|12=|10=3|20=2|9=|8=1|7=|6=2 July — Gaziantep|5=1|4=|4|19=|21=3 July — Antalya|40=1 |32=|39=|38=2|37=|36=2 July — Istanbul|35=2|34=|33=1|31=2 July — Istanbul|22= |30=1 (8)|29= (p)|28=1 (7)|27=|26=3 July — Trabzon|25=0|24=|23=1|widescore=yes}} === Round of 16 === \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- === Quarterfinals === \\---- \\---- \\---- === Semifinals === \\---- === Third place match === === Final === == Awards == The following awards were given out after the conclusion of the tournament: adidasGolden Ball adidasSilver Ball adidasBronze Ball Paul Pogba Nicolás López Clifford Aboagye adidasGolden Boot adidasSilver Boot adidasBronze Boot Ebenezer Assifuah Bruma Jesé 6 goals (0 assists) 5 goals (2 assists) 5 goals (1 assist) adidas Golden Glove Guillermo de Amores FIFA Fair Play Award == Goalscorers == ; 6 goals * Ebenezer Assifuah ; 5 goals * Bruma * Jesé ; 4 goals * Nicolás Castillo * Yaya Sanogo * Nicolás López ; 3 goals * Juan Quintero * Florian Thauvin * Farhan Shakor * Abdul Jeleel Ajagun * Aladje ; 2 goals * Ángelo Henríquez * Jhon Córdoba * Ante Rebić * Ahmed Hassan Koka * Jean-Christophe Bahebeck * Geoffrey Kondogbia * Kennedy Ashia * Frank Acheampong * Richmond Boakye * Ali Faez * Ali Adnan * Kwon Chang-hoon * Ryu Seung-woo * Olarenwaju Kayode * Aminu Umar * Gerard Deulofeu * Cenk Şahin * Giorgian De Arrascaeta * Abbosbek Makhstaliev * Sardor Rakhmonov * Igor Sergeev ; 1 goal * Joshua Brillante * Daniel De Silva * Jamie Maclaren * Christian Bravo * Felipe Mora * Andrés Rentería * Marko Livaja * Stipe Perica * Maykel Reyes * Kahraba * Trezeguet * Diego Coca * José Peña * Conor Coady * Harry Kane * Luke Williams * Paul Pogba * Jordan Veretout * Thibaut Vion * Kurt Zouma * Michael Anaba * Joseph Attamah * Moses Odjer * Seidu Salifu * Andreas Bouchalakis * Dimitris Diamantakos * Dimitris Kolovos * Kostas Stafylidis * Mohannad Abdul-Raheem * Ammar Abdul-Hussein * Mahdi Kamil * Saif Salman * Jung Hyun-cheol * Kim Hyun * Lee Gwang-hoon * Song Joo-hoon * Samba Diallo * Adama Niane * Marco Bueno * Jesús Corona * Jesús Escoboza * Jonathan Espericueta * Arturo González * Uvaldo Luna * Louis Fenton * Derlis González * Brian Montenegro * Jorge Rojas * Tiago Ferreira * Edgar Ié * Ricardo * Tozé * Paco Alcácer * Derik * Sinan Bakış * Hakan Çalhanoğlu * Salih Uçan * Okay Yokuşlu * Federico Gino * Felipe Avenatti * Rubén Bentancourt * Gonzalo Bueno * Daniel Cuevas * Luis Gil * Shane O'Neill * Diyorjon Turapov ; 1 own goal * Jozo Šimunović (playing against Chile) == Final ranking == == Miscellanea == === Trophy === The winners were the first team to receive an updated version of the trophy, with Rebecca Cusack and Thomas R.
