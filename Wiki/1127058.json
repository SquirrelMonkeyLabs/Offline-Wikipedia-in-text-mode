 "text": "The Ashina rebellion was a revolution that resulted in the establishment of the First Turkic khaganate and the fall of the Rouran state. == Reason for Revolt == After a series of diplomatic relations, Bumin, the first known Turkic ruler, was officially recognized by the Western Wei state and subsequently annexed the TÃ¶les tribes. As a result, he began to see himself as equal to the Rouran state to which he belonged, and to prove this to the Rouran Khagan, he wanted to marry his daughter. For this purpose, he sent an envoy to the Rouran Khan and attempted to marry his daughter. The Rouran leader A-na-kuei rejected this proposal very strongly. He then sent a counter envoy and insulted Bumin by saying, \"You are my iron-working slave, how dare you speak to me?\". Thus he declared that he did not recognize Bumin as a power. Bumin killed A-na-kuei's envoy. == Revolt == In the spring of 552, the Gokturk horsemen, moving from the southeast of the Altai mountains, crossed the Gobi desert and arrived north of the Huai-huang region outside the Great Wall of China, where they defeated A-na-kuei's army. Unable to bear the pain of defeat, A-na-kuei committed suicide and the Rourans dispersed. Bumin became Il-Kagan and his wife became Khatun. The Rourans were killed and enslaved, never to establish a state again. == References == Category:550s Category:History of Asia",
