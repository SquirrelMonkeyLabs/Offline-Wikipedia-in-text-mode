 "text": "The Ayyubid Sultanate (Arabic: الأيوبيون al-Ayyūbīyūn; Kurdish: ئەیووبیەکان, Eyûbiyan) was dynasty of Kurdish origin that ruled Egypt, Syria, the Jazira and the Yemen in the 12th and 13th centuries. The name of the dynasty is attributed to Ayyub b. Shadhi, the father of Saladin. The Ayyūbids played a significant role in the history of the region, notably ending Fatimid, uniting Syria and Egypt, and defeating the Crusaders. Saladin, founder of the dynasty, was Kurdish and the former vizier of Fatimid Caliphate. == Kurd or Arab? == Bosworth states that the Ayyubids belonged to the Hadhbani tribe of the Kurds, but argues that the Ayyubids were considerably Arabized. Humphreys also identifies Saladin as a Kurd and the Ayyubids as a Kurdish family. He argues that the Ayyubids were not specifically a Kurdish state, and that at the level of political structure, the governing attitudes of the Ayyubid confederation were not significantly different from those of previous Arab states such as the Abbasids and Fatimids, which can certainly be attributed to the political institutions of their original homeland. Humphreys takes into account Minorsky's speculations on the \"Arab origins\" of the Ayyubids. Tabaa, on the other hand, argues that over time the Ayyubids drastically moved away from their Kurdish origins and became decidedly Arabized. === Medieval historiography === Various medieval historians spoke of Saladin's Kurdishness: Minhaj-i Siraj Juzjani (1193–1266) at Tabaqat-i Nasiri: The Chronography of Bar Habraeus (1225–1286): Ibn Khallikan (1211–1282) at Wafayat al-Ayan: == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * == Notes == Category:History of Islam Category:Kurdistan Category:History of the Middle East Category:Royal dynasties Category:Former countries in the Middle East Category:Former countries in Africa",
