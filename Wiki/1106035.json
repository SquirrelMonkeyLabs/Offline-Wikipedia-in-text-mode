The event played an important role in the Italian Unification. == Background == A year before the war, France agreed in the Plombi√®res Agreement to support Sardinia's attempts to expel Austria from Italy. In return, France will gain territory in the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice. The two signed a military alliance in January 1859, and Sardinia mobilized its army on 9 March 1859. On 23 April, Austria sent an ultimatum to Sardinia that demanded its demobilization. When Sardinia rejected the ultimatum, Austria invaded the country, and France declared war on Austria on 3 May. == Notes == Category:Wars involving Italy Category:1859 in Europe",
