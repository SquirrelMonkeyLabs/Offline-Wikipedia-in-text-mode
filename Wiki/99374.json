The Korean name is Paektu-san or Baekdu-san, which means \"white head mountain\". The Chinese name is Changbai-shan, which means \"snow that piles up on the large mountain\". Paektu has a large caldera (crater lake). It is called Heaven Lake. Koreans call it \"Cheon-ji\" lake, Chinese call it \"Tiandi\" lake. It is 2,744 metres above sea level and is the highest mountain of all Korea. The Beijing Olympic torch was lit on Paektu/Changbai Mountain. Heaven Lake is a caldera made by a gigantic volcanic eruption in 969 AD (± 20 years) which had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 7. The 969 eruption, which is called the \"Millennium\" or \"Tianchi\" eruption, was one of the most violent eruptions in the last 5,000 years, comparable to the 180 AD \"Hatepe eruption\" of Lake Taupo and the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora. == References == Category:Biosphere reserves Category:Mountains of China Category:Volcanoes of Korea Category:Volcanoes of Asia Category:VEI-7 volcanoes",
