 "text": "The Delta IV was a rocket made to launch satellites. It had many different types including Medium, Medium+, and Heavy for many different types of satellites orbiting at many different altitudes above the Earth. The Delta IV had launches at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. It was no longer used after it's 45th mission. == Launches == The Delta IV was launched 32 times. The first flight was on November 20, 2002, and it launched the Eutelsat W5 communications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). == Types == The Delta IV rocket came in many different types meant to launch different sizes and kinds of satellites. === Delta IV Medium === The least powerful kind of the Delta IV rocket was the Medium type. It has 1 main Common Booster Core (CBC) as the first stage of the rocket, using the RS-68 engine, and the second stage is like from the Delta III rocket, but it has been changed. It uses a 4-meter payload fairing to cover the satellite during the launch of the rocket. This kind was launched 3 times. ==== Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) ==== The Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) was like the Medium type, but it has two GEM-60 solid rocket boosters strapped onto the CBC. This kind has launched 13 times, and is the kind of Delta IV rocket that was launched the most times. ==== Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) ==== The Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) was like the (4,2), but the second stage and fairing has a larger diameter. This kind was launched 2 times. ==== Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) ==== The Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) was like the (5,2), but it has two more GEM-60 solid rocket boosters. This kind was launched 5 times. === Delta IV Heavy === The Delta IV Heavy was the biggest kind of Delta IV rockets. It has two CBC strapped onto it like solid rocket boosters. This kind had launched 9 times, and was the most powerful rocket currently doing launches (the most powerful rocket ever is the Saturn V). It flew the last Delta IV mission on April 9, 2024 with NROL-70, a top secret spy satellite, and launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station SLC-37B. == Related pages == * Delta II * Atlas V == References == == Other websites == * Delta IV info page from ULA * Delta IV User's Guide Category:Rockets",
