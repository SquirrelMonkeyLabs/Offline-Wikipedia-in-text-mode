 "text": "Falkland is a town in Fife, Scotland, UK. Falkland Palace is in the town. James IV started building it in 1500. It is the best example of French- influenced Renaissance architecture in the United Kingdom. Mary, Queen of Scots came to visit often. A fire happened when Oliver Cromwell's troops stayed in the palace. The fire in 1654 destroyed the East Range. The Court never came back to Falkland Palace after 1665. In the late 19th century rebuilding and restoration work began. Today the palace and gardens are open to the public through the National Trust for Scotland. ==References== Category:Towns in Fife",
