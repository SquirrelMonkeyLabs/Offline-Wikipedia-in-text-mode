 "text": "The M14 rifle is an American 7.62Ã—51mm NATO battle rifle. The United States Military began using it in 1959 during the Vietnam War. The M14 production began in 1959 and ended in 1964. The M14 can be used as a battle rifle and as a sniper rifle in later years. The M14 was based on the M1 Garand and is essentially a modernized variant of it. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the M14 was replaced by the M16A1 by the United States Army in Vietnam. The rifle returned to active service with the US Army as the M14 EBR in 2002, where it has remained in service as a dedicated marksman rifle with updates and changes to its design, including an adjustable and collapsible stock, adjustable sights, rails and a bipod. == References == Category:Battle rifles Category:Rifles of the Cold War Category:7.62 mm rifles",
