Oberlander was on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of most wanted Nazi war criminals. Beginning in 1994, the Government of Canada made repeated attempts to revoke Oberlander's citizenship. In July 2017 the Government of Canada used an Order in Council to strip Oberlander of his Canadian citizenship for the fourth time. Oberlander died at his home in Waterloo, Ontario on 20 September 2021, at the age of 97. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:Holocaust perpetrators Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada Category:Soviet military people Category:Ukrainian people Category:Waffen-SS people",
