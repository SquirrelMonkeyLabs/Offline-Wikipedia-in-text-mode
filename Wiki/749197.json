 "text": "Ira Samuel Einhorn (May 15, 1940 â€“ April 3, 2020), known as \"The Unicorn Killer\", was an American convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend, Holly Maddux. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On September 9, 1977, Maddux disappeared following a trip to collect her belongings from the apartment she and Einhorn had shared in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eighteen months later, police found her partially mummified body in a trunk in Einhorn's closet. After his arrest, Einhorn fled the country and spent twenty- three years in Europe before being taken back to the United States. He said that his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research. He was convicted and served a life sentence at a prison in Pennsylvania until his death in prison in April 2020 of heart disease, aged 79. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People who died in prison custody in the United States Category:American environmentalists Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People from Philadelphia Category:Jewish American criminals",
