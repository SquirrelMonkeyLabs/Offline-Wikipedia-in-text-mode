 "text": "Deas Island is a peninsula on the Fraser River in British Columbia. The peninsula is between the cities of Delta and Richmond. It is named after John Sullivan Deas, a former slave from South Carolina and cannery owner who worked in the peninsula in 1873. The peninsula is known for the George Massey Tunnel which is located on Deas Island. It is also home to the George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary. A Greek settlement lived on the peninsula from between 1895 until sometime in the 1940s. There are three notable buildings on the island. A house called Burrvilla; a small schoolhouse called Inverholme, and the Delta Agricultural Hall. The Burrvilla house is home to British Columbia's largest colony of bats. Today, the island is home to Deas Island Regional Park and is a popular bird watching location. ==References== Category:Geography of British Columbia",
