It is the oldest Chinatown in the world; established in 1594 by the Spanish colonizers as a settlement for Catholic Chinese, across the Pasig River from their walled fortification of Intramuros. it was positioned so that the Spanish colonial administration could keep a close eye on their migrant subjects and overseen by the Dominican friars that founded the famous Binondo Church in 1596. Despite this, Binondo had already been a hub of Chinese barter preceding the Spanish colonial period, and continues today is the center of Chinese commerce and trade of Manila, where all types of business run by Filipino-Chinese thrive. ==References== Category:Settlements in Manila Category:Districts of Manila",
