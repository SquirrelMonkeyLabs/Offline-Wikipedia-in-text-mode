They have taken part in almost all Games since then. In 1956, the nation boycotted the Games in Melbourne as a protest against the Soviet invasion in Hungary just a few weeks before the Games. They did have one person take part in the Equestrian events that were held in Stockholm a few months before the rest of the Games. The Netherlands hosted the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The Netherlands want to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in either Amsterdam or Rotterdam, as a 100 year celebration of the 1928 Games.Feasibility Studies For Boston 2020, Netherlands 2028 Summer Games Before to the 1992 Olympics, the country name was \"Holland\" with the country code of \"HOL\". From the 1992 onward, they have used the \"Netherlands\" and \"NED\". Dutch athletes have won 246 medals at the Summer Olympic Games. They have won the most of their medals in swimming and cycling. The nation has won 86 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. Eighty-two of these medals have come from speed skating. The Netherlands Antilles, a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), left the Netherlands in 2010. This caused the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee (NAOC) to lose its Olympic license in July, 2011. After the 2012 Olympic Games in London, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles can choose to be a member of the team for the Netherlands or Aruba, which is a semi-independent part of the kingdom of the Netherlands. At the 2012 Games, athletes from the Netherlands Antilles will be a part of the unified Olympic team under the IOC flag. Some athletes have said that they want to be a part of either the Netherlands or Aruba in London. ==Medal tables== ===Medals by Summer Games=== 1900 Paris 0 1 3 4 1904 St. Louis did not participate did not participate did not participate did not participate 1908 London 0 0 2 2 1912 Stockholm 0 0 3 3 1920 Antwerp 4 2 5 11 1924 Paris 4 1 5 10 1928 Amsterdam (host nation) 6 9 4 19 1932 Los Angeles 2 5 0 7 1936 Berlin 6 4 7 17 1948 London 5 2 9 16 1952 Helsinki 0 5 0 5 1956 Melbourne did not participate did not participate did not participate did not participate 1960 Rome 0 1 2 3 1964 Tokyo 2 4 4 10 1968 Mexico City 3 3 1 7 1972 Munich 3 1 1 5 1976 Montreal 0 2 3 5 1980 Moscow 0 1 2 3 1984 Los Angeles 5 2 6 13 1988 Seoul 2 2 5 9 1992 Barcelona 2 6 7 15 1996 Atlanta 4 5 10 19 2000 Sydney 12 9 4 25 2004 Athens 4 9 9 22 2008 Beijing 7 5 4 16 Total 71 79 96 246 ===Medals by Winter Games=== 1928 St. Moritz 0 0 0 0 1932 Lake Placid did not participate did not participate did not participate did not participate 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen 0 0 0 0 1948 St. Moritz 0 0 0 0 1952 Oslo 0 3 0 3 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo 0 0 0 0 1960 Squaw Valley 0 1 1 2 1964 Innsbruck 1 1 0 2 1968 Grenoble 3 3 3 9 1972 Sapporo 4 3 2 9 1976 Innsbruck 1 2 3 6 1980 Lake Placid 1 2 1 4 1984 Sarajevo 0 0 0 0 1988 Calgary 3 2 2 7 1992 Albertville 1 1 2 4 1994 Lillehammer 0 1 3 4 1998 Nagano 5 4 2 11 2002 Salt Lake City 3 5 0 8 2006 Turin 3 2 4 9 2010 Vancouver 4 1 3 8 Total 29 31 26 86 ===Medals by sport=== Speed skating 27 29 26 82 Swimming 18 17 18 53 Cycling 15 16 9 40 Equestrian 10 10 2 22 Athletics 6 3 6 15 Rowing 5 11 10 26 Sailing 4 7 6 17 Field hockey 4 4 6 14 Judo 4 2 14 20 Figure skating 1 2 0 3 Boxing 1 1 4 6 Volleyball 1 1 0 2 Water polo 1 0 2 3 Archery 1 0 1 2 Gymnastics 1 0 0 1 Snowboarding 1 0 0 1 Canoeing 0 3 5 8 Shooting 0 1 1 2 Tennis 0 1 1 2 Badminton 0 1 0 1 Tug of war 0 1 0 1 Fencing 0 0 5 5 Football 0 0 3 3 Weightlifting 0 0 3 3 Total 100 110 120 330 ==Related pages== * List of IOC country codes ==References== ==Other websites== * Netherlands at Olympic.org Category:Nations at the Olympics Category:National sports teams of the Netherlands",
