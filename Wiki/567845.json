It was the twenty-seventh Royal Rumble event held by WWE and the first to be held in Pittsburgh. Five matches happened at the event. The most important match was the Royal Rumble match. Batista won it by last eliminating Roman Reigns. In the match, Reigns eliminated twelve men, which broke Kane's record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match. Alexander Rusev also made his WWE main roster debut in the match. The match is also known for being CM Punk's last wrestling match before he walked out of WWE. Punk later returned to wrestling at AEW's The First Dance in August 2021, and finally made his return to WWE at Survivor Series: WarGames two years later in November. == Results == == Royal Rumble entrances and eliminations == – NXT – Winner No. Entrant Order Eliminated by Time Eliminations CM Punk 27 Kane 49:12 3 Seth Rollins 25 Roman Reigns 48:37 3 Damien Sandow 1 CM Punk 02:17 0 Cody Rhodes 11 Goldust 21:01 1 Kane 2 CM Punk 01:10 1 Alexander Rusev 3 CM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Kofi Kingston, and Seth Rollins 07:06 0 Jack Swagger 6 Kevin Nash 12:24 0 Kofi Kingston 7 Roman Reigns 12:42 1 Jimmy Uso 5 Dean Ambrose 07:53 0 Goldust 12 Roman Reigns 12:00 1 Dean Ambrose 26 33:41 3 Dolph Ziggler 8 06:09 0 R-Truth 4 Dean Ambrose 00:28 0 Kevin Nash 9 Roman Reigns 02:36 1 Roman Reigns 29 Batista 33:51 12 The Great Khali 10 The Shield (Reigns, Rollins, Ambrose) 00:24 0 Sheamus 28 Roman Reigns 28:22 1 The Miz 16 Luke Harper 12:09 0 Fandango 13 El Torito 03:02 0 El Torito 14 Roman Reigns 01:49 1 Antonio Cesaro 24 16:57 0 Luke Harper 23 15:21 2 Jey Uso 17 Luke Harper 04:32 0 John Bradshaw Layfield 15 Roman Reigns 00:49 0 Erick Rowan 18 Batista 05:05 0 Ryback 19 04:01 0 Alberto Del Rio 20 03:00 0 Batista Winner 14:34 4 Big E Langston 21 Sheamus 02:49 0 Rey Mysterio 22 Seth Rollins 02:10 0 Kane was already eliminated when he returned to eliminate CM Punk later in the match. == References == Category:2014 in professional wrestling Category:Royal Rumble Category:Sports in Pittsburgh",
