The main use of this weapon is to provide cover fire for other soldiers in a squad (or group of soldiers). The gun uses 5.56 NATO caliber ammunition. ==Overview== The M249 was made because a lot of the squadrons of the U.S. Army did not have fully automatic weapons. It has seen action in every war that the United States has been in since 1989. ==Replacement== In the U.S. Marines, the M249 is due to be replaced by the German M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle. ==References== Category:Light machine guns Category:Machine guns of the United States",
