It is India's largest group of companies with products and services in over 150 countries, and operations in 100 countries across six continents. It was founded in 1868 by Jamshedji Tata who is sometimes referred to as the \"father of Indian industry\". Each Tata company operates independently under the guidance and supervision of its own board of directors and shareholders. These trusts control over 66% of the Tata holding company Tata Sons, while the family of Tata is a very small shareholder. There are 29 publicly listed Tata Group companies with a combined market estimating $311 billion as of March 2022. The company has operations across Asia, Africa, America and Middle East. Some of the subsidiaries are Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Air India, Titan company. ==History== === 1839–1904 === Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata was born in 1839. Tata graduated from Elphinstone College in Bombay in 1858. Shortly afterwards, he joined his father's trading firm that dealt in general merchandise. There, the junior Tata took a special interest in developing trade with China. When the American Civil War caused a boom in the Bombay cotton market, Tata and his father joined the Asiatic Banking Corporation. When the tide ebbed, Tata's credit was left desolate. Fortunately, the firm's credit was re-established during the next three years. A share in the lucrative contract for the commissariat of Napier's expedition to Abyssinia in 1868 restored the family fortune.\" In 1870 with Rs.21,000 capital, he founded a trading company. Further, he bought a bankrupt oil mill at Chinchpokli and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name Alexandra Mill which he sold for a profit after two years. In 1874, he set up another cotton mill at Nagpur named Empress Mill. He dreamed of achieving four goals, setting up an iron and steel company, a unique hotel, a world-class learning institution, and a hydroelectric plant. During his lifetime, in 1903, the Taj Mahal Hotel at Colaba waterfront was opened making it the first hotel with electricity in British India. === 1904–1938 === After Jamsetji's death, his older son Dorabji Tata became the chairman in 1904. Sir Dorabji established the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), now known as Tata Steel in 1907. Marking the group's global ambitions, Tata Limited opened its first overseas office in London. Following the founder's goals, Western India's first hydro plant was brought to life, giving birth to Tata Power. Yet another dream, Indian Institute of Science was established with the first group of students admitted in 1911. === 1938–1991 === J. R. D. Tata was made chairman of the Tata Group in 1938. Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to over US$5 billion. Starting with 14 enterprises, upon his departure half a century later in 1988, Tata Sons had grown to a conglomerate of 95 enterprises. These enterprises consisted of ventures that the company had either started or in which they held a controlling interest. New sectors such as chemicals, technology, cosmetics, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, tea, and software services earned them recognition. In 1932, JRD founded an airline, known as Tata Air Services (later renamed Tata Airlines). In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from Tata Sons, though JRD Tata would continue as chairman till 1977. In 1945, Tata Motors was founded, first focused on locomotives. In 1954, it entered the commercial vehicle market after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz. In 1968, Tata Consultancy Services was founded. === 1991–Present === In 1991, Ratan Tata became chairman of Tata Group. This was also the year of economic liberalization in India, opening up the market to foreign competitors. During this time, Tata Group began to acquire several companies. Tata Group bought Tetley In February 2000. After that, it acquired Corus Group in 2007. In the year 2008, it acquired Jaguar and Land Rover.
