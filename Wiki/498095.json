 "text": "Häagen-Dazs is a brand of ice cream shops and ice cream franchises. They specialize in ice cream cones, ice cream cups, and ice cream shakes. They have franchises in the United States and many other countries around the world. Häagen-Dazs was created in 1961 by Reuben and Rose Mattus in The Bronx, New York. They opened their first store on November 15, 1976 in Brooklyn. The \"Häagen-Dazs\" name was invented by Mattus since it was \"Danish-sounding\". He used it as a tribute to Denmark's good treatment of Jews during World War II. An outline of Denmark was also used on their early labels. The name is not Danish. In 1983, Häagen-Dazs was bought by Pillsbury. Pillsbury was then bought by General Mills in 2001. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:1961 establishments in New York (state) Category:American food companies Category:Companies based in California Category:Oakland, California Category:The Bronx Category:Ice cream brands",
