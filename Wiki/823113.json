In Vigie-Cratère, ordinary people help scientists find craters on the surface of the Earth left by meteors, which are rocks that float through outer space. After they hit the Earth, they are called meteorites. Vigie-Cratère is part of Vigie-Ciel. France's National Museum of Natural History, CNRS, University of Paris Saclay, IRD, Paris Observatory, Grenoble Alpes University, Universcience, the Pythéas Institute, and the Natural History Museum Vienna pay for Vigie-Cratère. ==Other websites== *Vigie-Cratère Official Website ==References== Category:Citizen science organizations Category:Geology Category:Outer space Category:Organizations based in France",
