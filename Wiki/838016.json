It is the third film in the Krrish series, following Koi... Mil Gaya (2003) and Krrish (2006). The film stars Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi, Priyanka Chopra and Kangana Ranaut. Krrish 3 released worldwide on 1 November 2013. It has received generally positive reviews and became a blockbuster. Roshan and Ranaut's performances, the visual effects, the cinematography, and entertainment value were good according to the audience, but the music by Rajesh Roshan, the narration, and the screenplay were terrible according to the audience. ==Plot== Dr. Rohit Mehra is a scientist living with his son Krishna Mehra (both played by Hrithik Roshan) in Mumbai. Krishna is married to Priya (Priyanka Chopra) who works as a journalist for Aaj Tak. Rohit works in a research institute for the Indian government and Krishna, while moonlighting as the superhero Krrish, is regularly fired from various day jobs due to lack of attendance. Rohit is researching on a device that will bring life to dead tissues by the use of solar energy. Despite several attempts, he fails to complete the experiment due to the high intensity of sun rays. On a usual day, Krishna loses his job from the security wing of a company when he hears news about an airplane whose front tires are stuck due to some malfunctioning which creates high risk, even if landed, it may explode and so will the passengers inside. Krishna immediately changes himself to Krrish and saves the plane from accident by holding the component to make tires free to roam. A few days later, Rohit hears about a deadly disease spreading in the African country of Namibia due to a virus whose antidote has not yet been discovered. He consults his friend Dr. Varun Shetty (Arif Zakaria) about the situation. Meanwhile, Shetty receives a phone call from Dr. Alok Sen (Asif Basra), a scientist working for Kaal Laboratories who insists on meeting him in order to reveal information about an antidote to the virus. Both Sen and Shetty are, however, murdered by Kaya (Kangana Ranaut), a form-changing female mutant. She is the right hand person of Kaal (Vivek Oberoi), a handicapped evil genius who possess telekinetic powers. Kaal creates a team of \"maanvars\" (an hybrid of humans and animals) with distinct physical powers in order to cure himself but fails. Kaal suffers from lower-body paralysis and is looking for a bone marrow that can treat him. After failing to find a suitable donor in the human world, he turned to the animal world by fusing human DNA with animal DNA which led to the creation of \"maanvars\" including Kaya. Later, it is revealed the virus in Africa was spread by Kaal himself to incur huge profits by selling its antidote, the singular source of which is his blood. In the middle of all this, Priya falls pregnant. Rohit discovers that the virus, which is fast spreading through Mumbai, has no effect on Krishna, the pregnant Priya or himself. He, thus, makes an antidote by using the blood from Krishna's bloodstream which he spreads with the help of explosions. An enraged Kaal sends his mutants to attack Rohit and find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood. Krrish manages to save Rohit, but Priya is injured and hospitalised. Krrish, however, manages to defeat the mutant Striker (Gowhar Khan). Kaya, carrying out Kaal's instructions, takes Priya's form while Priya is kidnapped by Kaal. In the form of Priya, Kaya lets Krishna believe that Priya has suffered a miscarriage, and continues to live with the Mehras. While finding the truth behind the antidote's formula she develops an attraction towards Krishna. Failing to get answers about Frog Man's involvement with the virus attack, Rohit travels to Singapore to seek answers from Dr. Siddhant Arya's (Naseeruddin Shah) partner, where he is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Meanwhile, Krishna discovers the true identity of Priya; furious, he reveals himself as Krrish to Kaya and orders her to take him to Kaal's laboratory. Having fallen in love with Krishna, Kaya decides to help rescue his wife. At Kaal's laboratory, it is revealed that Kaal is Rohit's son, who was created by an experiment conducted by Dr. Arya while Rohit was held hostage by him. The child was born handicapped, and was thus given away to an orphanage from where he was adopted by a wealthy man (Mohnish Behl). Kaal uses Rohit's bone marrow to successfully cure his handicap. Meanwhile, Kaya saves Priya and reunites her with Krrish; she is, however, murdered by Kaal for her disloyalty. Kaal subsequently murders Krrish, and wears a metal suit. Deeply disturbed by his son's death, Rohit decides to re-use his failed experiment to bring dead tissues to life in order to save Krishna. This time, however, he absorbs the excess energy himself. Though the process kills Rohit, it transfers his powers to a revived Krishna. Meanwhile, Kaal threatens to destroy the city of Mumbai if Priya does not surrender to him. Krrish re- emerges and, after several unsuccessful attempts, manages to kill him using Rohit's solar experiment. The film ends six months later with Priya naming her and Krishna's newborn son Rohit, who also exhibits superpowers. ==Cast== * Hrithik Roshan as Krishna Mehra / Krrish and Rohit Mehra * Vivek Oberoi as Kaal * Priyanka Chopra as Priya Mehra * Kangana Ranaut as Kaya * Arif Zakaria as Dr. Varun Shetty * Asif Basra as Dr. Alok Sen * Rajpal Yadav as Kripal Sharma * Rakhee Vijan as Sharma's wife * Gowhar Khan as Striker * Nazia Shaikh as Cheetah Woman * Sameer Ali Khan as Ant Man * Shaurya Chauhan as Scorpion Woman * Daniel Kaleb as Rhino Man * Vineet Sharma as Pilot of Air India aircraft * Sachin Khedekar as Chief minister of Maharashtra (Special appearance) * Naseeruddin Shah as Dr. Siddhant Arya (Special appearance) * Mohnish Behl as Kaal's adoptive father (Special appearance) * Anupam Kher as a scientist in Kaal's lab * Rekha and Preity Zinta appear as Sonia Mehra and Nisha, respectively, in flashback scenes from Koi...Mil Gaya and Krrish == References == Category:Movies directed by Rakesh Roshan Category:2010s Indian movies",
