 "text": "Rohde's frog, Rohde's leaf frog, or Marten's leaf frog (Pithecopus rohdei) is a frog that lives in southern Brazil, not high in the hills. People have seen it as high as 1000 meters above sea level. This frog is not in danger of dying out. Scientists say this is because it can live in different kinds of places. This frog lays its eggs on leaves hanging over streams. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the stream. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
