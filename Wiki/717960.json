 "text": "Truncus arteriosus is a stage in the development of the heart. It is the arterial trunk that starts from both ventricles of the heart. Later it divides into the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. Failure of the truncus arteriosus to close results in the condition known as persistent truncus arteriosus, a rare congenital heart defect. It is a type of heart disease. People are born with this condition. There are no cures. If not operated on at an early age people may die from this condition. == References == Category:Heart disease Category:Developmental disorders",
