 "text": "Morus alba (the white mulberry, common mulberry, or the silkworm mulberry),Morus alba L. by Weeds of Australia - Biosecurity Queensland Edition (Queensland Government) is a genus of 10â€“16 species of trees. They are native to warm regions of Central Asia, and South-central Asia, with most of the species native to Asia. Mulberry leaves, particularly those of the white mulberry, Morus alba, are important as the food of the silkworm, the cocoon of which is used to make silk. Morus alba is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen, which is launched at over half the speed of sound. \"This is the fastest motion yet observed in biology, and approaches the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants\". == References == Category:Trees Category:Berries Category:Moraceae Category:Rapid plant movement",
