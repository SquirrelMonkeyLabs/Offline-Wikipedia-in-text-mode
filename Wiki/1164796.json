 "text": "Butterfly doors are a type of car door. They are sometimes on high-performance cars. Butterfly doors move out from the car and up from hinges. This makes it easier to enter and exit the car. == History == Butterfly doors were first seen on the Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale in 1967. The Toyota Sera was the first mass-produced car with butterfly doors. The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren is one of the few open-top cars to use butterfly wing doors. This is made possible by having hinge points along the side of the A-pillar instead of at the top.
