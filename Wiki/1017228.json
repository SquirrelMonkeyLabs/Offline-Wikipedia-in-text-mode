These assistants often use chatbot technology to simulate human conversation, allowing users to interact with them through online chat or voice. Virtual assistants can interpret user speech and respond using synthesized voices. Users can ask virtual assistants questions, control smart home devices, manage tasks like email and calendars, and perform other basic functions through verbal commands. Popular virtual assistants for consumers include Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google Assistant. Many companies also use virtual assistant technology to enhance customer service or support. The advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly in chatbot technology like ChatGPT, has expanded the capabilities and interest in virtual assistant products and services. == References == Category:Artificial intelligence",
