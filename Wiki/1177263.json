 "text": "Ala al-Din Ali (January 1353 – August 1380) was the third Sultan of the Eretnid dynasty. He ruled from 1366 until 1380. When he was only 13 years old, his father, Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad I, was killed, and Ala al-Din became Sultan. However, he wasn't a strong leader. Because of this, the Eretnids lost land to nearby rulers. During his time as Sultan, local rulers called emirs became very powerful. The city of Kayseri, which was the capital, was taken over for a short time by a group called the Karamanids. Ala al-Din's advisor, Kadi Burhan al-Din, tried to fix the situation but faced many problems. Ala al-Din joined some battles, but they did not go well. In 1380, he died from the plague during a campaign against the emir of Amasya. He was buried in Köşkmedrese in Kayseri, near his father and grandfather. ==Background== The Eretnid dynasty was started by Ala al-Din's grandfather, Eretna, who was an officer from the Uyghurs. In 1343, Eretna broke away from the Ilkhanate and became independent. He ruled well until he died in 1352. After that, his son, Ala al-Din's father, had trouble keeping control and lost land to rival leaders. He was eventually killed, which led to Ala al-Din becoming the Sultan. ==Family== Ala al-Din had one son, Muhammad II Chelebi, who was only seven years old when Ala al-Din died. Since Muhammad was too young to rule, a regent (a temporary ruler) took care of him. The emirs fought for power, and Kadi Burhan al-Din became the most powerful. Some historical accounts say that Kadi Burhan al-Din might have killed Muhammad, but it is not certain. ==Legacy== Ala al-Din Ali is remembered as a weak ruler. His decisions and lack of leadership caused the Eretnid state to lose land and power. His reign marked the beginning of the Eretnid dynasty's fall. == References == Category:1353 births Category:1380 deaths Category:Monarchs",
