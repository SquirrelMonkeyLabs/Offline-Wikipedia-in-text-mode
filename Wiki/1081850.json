 "text": "A Punjabi Qissa ( (Shahmukhi), (Gurmukhi)) is a tradition of Punjabi language oral story-telling in Punjab region of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. == Qisse and the Punjabi culture == The Punjabi language has a vast literature of qisse, mainly focused on themes of love, passion, betrayal, sacrifice, social values, and the common man's rebellion against a larger system. In Punjabi tradition, friendship, loyalty, love and qaul (verbal agreement or promise) hold great importance, and most qisse revolve around these elements. Qisse have inspired Punjabi folk music and added depth and richness to its delivery. These traditions were passed down through generations through oral or written forms and were often recited, told as bedtime stories to children, or performed musically as folk songs. Each qissa has unique requirements for performance, and a person who can sing or recite one may not be able to transmit another due to vocal range requirements and accurate pauses necessary for successful recitation without becoming breathless and unable to continue performing. Many modern Punjabi music beats originated from qisse traditions and recitations in old times. Qisse are also considered some of the best poetry ever written in Punjabi language literature due to their themes and poetic style of expression. == Gallery == File:Trilok_singh_Chitarkar_sohni2.jpg|Sohni Mahiwal File:Trilok_Singh_Artist_1954.jpg|Sassui Punnhun File:Bodleian_MS._Ouseley_Add._166_fol_13b.jpg|Layla visits Majnun in the wilderness File:Sohni_Swims_to_Meet_Her_Lover_Mahinwal_LACMA_M.72.2.1.jpg|Sohni swims to meet her lover Mahiwal == References == * ==Other websites== * ApnaOrg offers one of the most reliable but largely incomplete list of Punjabi literature and music. * Punjabi People & Old Stories Network of Punjabi People Category:Indian literature",
