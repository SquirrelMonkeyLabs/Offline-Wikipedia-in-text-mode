 "text": "Silverstone's rocket frog (Colostethus imbricolus) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground near streams in forests. Sometimes people see it on banana farms. Scientists saw the frog between 200 and 300 meters above sea level. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Parque Nacional Utr√≠a. ==Young== After the eggs hatch, the female frog carries the tadpoles to streams, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Humans cut down the forests to get wood to build with, to make towns, and to make farms. Some of the farms are legal and some are against the law. The chemicals that farmers put on the plants to make them grow can also hurt this frog. There are gold mines near where the frogs live, and any frogs near the mines could be hurt or die. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could kill this frog too, but they are not sure if it has killed many of these frogs or not. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
