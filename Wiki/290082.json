 "text": "Tom Araya (born Tomás Enrique Araya June 6, 1961 in Viña del Mar, Chile) is an Chilean-American musician, best known as the bassist and vocalist of the American thrash metal band Slayer. Araya is ranked fifty-eighth by Hit Parader on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. Araya was employed as a respiratory therapist in the early 1980s and used his earnings to finance Slayer's debut album Show No Mercy. Much of Araya's lyrical content is about serial killers, a subject he finds interesting, first making his lyrical contribution to 1985's Hell Awaits with the track \"At Dawn They Sleep\". ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean singers Category:Bassists Category:Heavy metal singers Category:Heavy metal musicians Category:People from Viña del Mar Category:Chilean musicians Category:20th-century American guitarists",
