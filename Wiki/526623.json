 "text": "A reign is the period of time that a monarch (a king, queen, emperor, etc.) rules over a country. It can also be the period of time that a spiritual leader rules in a particular office. For example, the reign of a pope, dalai lama, patriarch etc. A reign can also be used for an office or championship. In many cases a reign lasts until the monarch (or leader) resigns, dies, or is removed. A monarch's reign was sometimes used to mark time officially. In Anglo-Saxon England for example, many royal documents were dated by the regnal year of the king.Michael Jones, A Handbook of Dates: For Students of British History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 21 This lasted until about the 10th century. == Current Longest Reigning Monarchs == Some of the longest reigning current monarchs are: *Elizabeth II, United Kingdom, 62+ years . *Sikiru Kayode Adetona, Nigeria, 55+ years. *Hassanal Bolkiah, Brunei, 47+ years. *Margrethe II of Denmark, 42+ years. *Sultan bin Muhammad Al- Qasimi, United Arab Emirates, 42+ years. *Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden 41+ years.
