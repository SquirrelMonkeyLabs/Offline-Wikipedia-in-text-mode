 "text": "The 2020 Twitter bitcoin scam was a large-scale hacking of Twitter accounts that started on July 15, 2020 at around 20:00 UTC. Many Twitter accounts, each with millions of followers, were hacked to promote a bitcoin scam. == Incident == The scam asked individuals to send bitcoin currency to a specific cryptocurrency wallet, with the promise that money sent would be doubled and returned. The perpetrators had gained access to Twitter's administrative tools so that they could alter the accounts themselves and post the tweets directly, with the access gained either possibly through paying off Twitter employees to use the tool, or hacked an employee's account to access the tool directly. The hacked accounts were those of: Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, MrBeast, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Kim Kardashian, and Kanye West, as well as companies like Apple, Uber, and Cash App. ==References== Category:2020 crimes Category:July 2020 events Category:Cryptocurrency Category:Twitter",
