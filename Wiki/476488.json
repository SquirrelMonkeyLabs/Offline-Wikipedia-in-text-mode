The airline flies between the major Hawaiian islands. These are Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, Maui, Lanai, and the Big Island of Hawai'i. Hawaiian also flies to more distant locations, such as the U.S. mainland, Japan, Korea, and Australia. These flights arrive and depart from Oahu and Maui. Hawaiian is the oldest U.S. airline without a fatal accident. It is also the oldest U.S. airline that has never had a plane destroyed or damaged beyond repair. ==History== ===Inter-Island Airways=== Hawaiian was incorporated as Inter-Island Airways on January 30, 1929. It gave sightseeing tours over Oahu. On November 11, 1929, it began flying between Honolulu and Hilo.Ann Rayson, Modern History of Hawai'i (Honolulu: Bess Press, 2004), p. 124 Inter-Island began flying two Sikorsky S-38 amphibious flying boat. Each carried eight passengers. They added larger Sikorsky S-43s six years later for more passengers and mail service. ===Name change to Hawaiian Airlines=== In 1941 Inter-Island Airways Ltd. changed its name to Hawaiian Airlines. In 1966, Hawaiian started using jets to fly between the islands. The jets were much faster and quieter than the propeller planes it was using. In 1984, Hawaiian began flying between Honolulu and the South Pacific. It also started flying between Honolulu and the U.S. West Coast. ===Aircraft and logo change=== In 1966, Hawaiian added all-jet aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9. Flying time between islands was reduced to 20â€“30 minutes. In 2002-03, Hawaiian replaced its planes with better ones. The new planes used less fuel to fly the same distances. It also changed the design on the tails of its planes. The airline also started flying to more locations. Today it flies approximately 212 flights a day. == References == == Additional reading == * Gradidge, J.M. The Convairliners story. 1997. Air-Britain (Historians) Ltd . * Gradidge, Jennifer.
