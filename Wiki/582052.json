 "text": "The Philadelphia Race Riots of 1964 was one of the first race riots during the Civil Rights Era. The riot started on August 28, 1964 when a conflict erupted between an African-American woman and a police officer when the woman's car broke down in a busy section of the city. Rumors quickly spread about the police allegedly beating up a pregnant black woman. Riots broke out mostly in Northern Philadelphia. Even though no one was killed, over 300 people were hurt, 25 stores were destroyed, and hundreds were arrested. ==References== Race Riot Category:1964 in the United States Category:Racially-motivated violence in the United States",
