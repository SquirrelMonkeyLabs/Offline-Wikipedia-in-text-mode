 "text": "The ti lao shu were the very first known rockets to ever exist. They were hollowed-out sticks of bamboo with gunpowder jammed inside. They were made in ancient China in the 1200s, predating the Goddard-1, the first \"modern\" liquid-fueled rocket, by hundreds of years. Since they used gunpowder, they were also the first solid-fueled motors to exist. Category:Rockets Category:History of China",
