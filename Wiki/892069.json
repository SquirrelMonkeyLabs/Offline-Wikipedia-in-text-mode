 "text": "In mathematics, an arithmetic progression, or arithmetic sequence, is a sequence. The difference between each two terms which follow one another is always the same. This is different from a geometric progression, where the ratio of change between two terms is constant. If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is a_1 and the common difference is d, then the n-th term of the sequence (a_n) is given by: :a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a finite arithmetic progression and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The sum of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series. Category:Sequences and series",
