 "text": "I Piani dei Resinelli o Piani Resinelli is a plateau of the Lombard Prealps, in the province of Lecco, between 1200 and 1300 m above sea level, at within the territory of the municipalities of Abbadia Lariana, Mandello del Lario, Ballabio and Lecco, on the slopes of the Grignetta. it is a base for excursions. == History == At the end of the 19th century the first shelters were built: in 1899 that of the Milanese excursionist society, in 1911 the Carlo Porta shelter. In 1917 the small church designed by the architect Paolo Mezzanotte dedicated to the Sacred Heart was built. At the beginning of the twentieth century, with the spread of mountaineering and tourism, the need arose to connect the Piani, then reachable by mule track, to the valley floor by a driveway. The first project, carried out by the engineer Naco Guzzi, dates back to 1915. The Strada Consortile Ballabio - Piani Resinelli arrived on 7 October 1936. The road that was owned by a consortium made up of the four municipalities of Ballabio, Abbadia Lariana , Mandello del Lario and Lecco, had a toll until 1980. After the construction of the road, the Plans had a tourist development with the construction of shelters, hotels, holiday homes and ski resorts. The practice of skiing at Resinelli has very ancient origins. In February 1913 the SEL (Lecco Excursionist Society) organized the first Italian championships and later a ski jump was built, which was later dismantled. At the end of the 1950s the first ski lifts were built; in a few years three lifts were opened: the Coltignone and Baby ski lifts and the Campo Scuola ropeway. It was busy as it is excellent for both beginners and more experienced skiers, who could try their hand on the slopes served by the Coltignone ski lift. In the 1980s fewer people came. There was less snow. The ski resorts were abandoned. Today only their ruins remain. During the thirties the Moto Guzzi administrator, Angelo Parodi, built his villa right here. Today his villa belongs to a lawyer from Lecco. Here the Calolden stream is born. == The mines == The Piani Resinelli Mining Park allows visitors to visit the lead-zinc mines located at 1300 m in the formation known as the \"metalliferous dolomia\". They were exploited from the 16th century until the Second World War. == The Adventure Park == The adventure park is on the path that leads to the Valentino park consisting of 11 paths in the trees suitable for everyone from 2 to 99 years old. The paths allow you to walk between one tree and another in complete safety equipped with a harness and carabiners, along Tibetan bridges, log walkways and zip line ropes. == Valentino Park == In 1961, following the donation made by the Lecco family Gerosa-Crotta to the Italian Touring Club of an area of about 185 hectares extended north of Mount Coltignone, Parco Valentino was born in the Resinelli Plains, at the center of which is the naturalistic museum of the Grigne. . == Cycling == The Giro d'Italia arrived twice at Pian dei Resinelli. == Mountain climbing == Here the mountaineer and explorer Walter Bonatti took his first steps. == Related pages == * Center of Lake Como * Geografia della Provincia di Lecco * Provincia di Lecco * Altopiano * Sentiero di Leonardo * Leonardo da Vinci * Virgin of the Rocks == Notes == == Bibliography == * Magni, Guida illustrata della Valsassina, 1926 * Dino Brivio, Montagna facile, Itinerari lecchesi - Banca Popolare di Lecco 1980 == Other websites == * Portale dei Piani Resinelli Piani Resinelli Category:Trails of Italy Category:Province of Lecco",
