 "text": "A clutch is a group of eggs. When people say \"clutch,\" they mean living eggs that have not hatched yet. Usually, they mean eggs laid by the same mother. Usually, they mean eggs laid at the same time. A clutch can be just one egg or many. For example, many ocean birds lay only one or two eggs in one clutch. Some frogs lay hundreds of eggs in one clutch. Sometimes the parents will stay with the clutch to guard it. Sometimes the parents will sit on the eggs to keep them warm. Sometimes the parents will bury or hide the eggs and then leave. == References == Category:Reproductive system",
