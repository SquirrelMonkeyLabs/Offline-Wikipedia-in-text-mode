 "text": "The Scutum-Centaurus Arm, also known as the Scutum-Crux Arm, is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. The Scutum-Centaurus Arm is located between the minor Carina–Sagittarius Arm and the minor Norma Arm. The Scutum-Centaurus Arm starts near the center as the Scutum Arm then turns into the Centaurus Arm. The part where the Scutum-Centaursu Arm connects to the bar of the Milky Way has lot of star-forming reigions and open clusters. In 2006 a large cluster of new stars containing 14 red supergiant stars was discovered and named RSGC1. Later in 2007 RSGC2 was discovered and was located only a few hundred light years from RSGC1.
