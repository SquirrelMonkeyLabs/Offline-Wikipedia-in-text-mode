The capital is Bregenz. The biggest cities are Feldkirch and Dornbirn. As of 2016, there were about 384,000 people. It is the only province in Austria that does not speak Austro-Bavarian. Instead they speak an Alemannic dialect. This makes it more in common with its Alemannic-speaking neighbors Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Swabia than with Bavaria and the rest of Austria. The highest mountain is Piz Buin. The main rivers in Vorarlberg are the Rhine, the Ill, the Bregenzer Ach and the Dornbirner Ach. 78% of the population is Roman Catholic. The second most follow Islam which has a share of 8.4%. Vorarlberg is divided into four large districts. They are Bregenz, Dornbirn, Feldkirch and Bludenz. On land, Vorarlberg has borders with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Germany. The respextive states are the Swiss cantons of St.Gallen and Graubünden, and the German state of Bavaria. Lake Constance is special, there are no borders apart fro the borders on land. Legally, all the states that share this lake, also have a common border. That way, Vorarlberg also has a common border with the German state of Baden-Württemberg, and the Swiss canton of Thurgau.",
