 "text": "The Shengana warty frog (Callulina shengena) is a frog. It lives in Tanzania. It lives in the South Pare mountains. People have seen it between 1920 and 2100 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 22.1–32.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 39.9–43.2 mm long. This frog is different from other frogs in Callulina because the eardrum is not easy to see and because the tips of its toes are shorter. This frog is usually dark pink to light pink in color, but some frogs are brown in color. Scientists named this frog after a part of the Pare mountains. ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
