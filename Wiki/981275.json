Castillo forced a curfew, created an emergency government and called for a constituent assembly. The act was seen as a self- coup d'état. Members of President Castillo's government resigned after his announcement with the Peruvian Armed Forces rejecting the president's actions as well. Castillo was impeached on the same day, and removed from office after the Constitutional Court of Peru rejected his dissolution of congress. Outside of the Mexican embassy in Lima, Castillo was arrested after attempting to leave and seek asylum in Mexico. ==References== Category:2022 in South America Category:2022 in Peru Category:Coups d'état Category:December 2022 events",
