 "text": "The 1931 Belize hurricane was a severe tropical cyclone that took place in September 1931. It killed more than twenty-five hundred in Central America, including Belize (called British Honduras at that time). The hurricane struck Belize City with winds near 135 miles per hour. The storm hit on September 10, and then traveled westward over the Yucat√°n Peninsula of eastern Mexico. It later weakened over the Bay of Campeche, made its final landfall near the northern Mexico-south central Texas border, and then died.
