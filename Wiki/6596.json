This constitution gave the king less power and the people more, so it made the Netherlands a democracy. Thorbecke was a liberal. Several times he was prime minister, and internal affairs minister. Thorbecke was a Lutheran and had German roots. He was born in Zwolle and died in The Hague, aged 74. == References == * Bio at Parlement.com Category:1798 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Dutch academics Category:Dutch jurists Category:Dutch Protestants Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands Category:Government ministers of the Netherlands Category:Lutherans Category:Politicians from Overijssel Category:Prime ministers of the Netherlands Category:Writers from Overijssel",
