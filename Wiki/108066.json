Red cinnabar is used for the pigment vermilion. It is poisonous, and may go black with age. The other crystal form is black, and does not react chemically to anything except strong acids. Cinnabar has a Mohs hardness of 2â€“2.5. Cinnabar has been mined since the Neolithic age. ==References== Category:Sulfide minerals Category:Pigments Category:Ores",
