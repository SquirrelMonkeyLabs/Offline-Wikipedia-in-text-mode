 "text": "Castizo (ca-STEE-tzo) is a Spanish term for a person who is around 3/4 White and 1/4 Native American ancestry. Castizos are mostly found in the Southern cone region of Latin America (especially Chile, Argentina and Brazil), Costa Rica, as well as parts of Northern and Western Mexico, many of the Canadian Metis (those of mixed French and First Nations ancestry from Canada) and Mixed-Blood Americans (those who mixed of English and Native American ancestry from the United States) are Castizos. Castizos usually have more European traits, but many can have light features, but with heavy Native American features, while many can have a dark Native American-like pigmentation, but totally white Spanish features. Famous Castizos include Johnny Depp, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, it's unknown whether they are genetically Castizo, but based on their phenotype, they appear to be.
