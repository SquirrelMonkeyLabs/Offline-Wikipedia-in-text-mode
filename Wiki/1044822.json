 "text": "The Ponmudi bush frog (Raorchestes graminirupes) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it exactly one place: Palmudi in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1030 and 1300 meters above sea level. This frog lives in grassy places and in places with low, woody plants. People have also seen it in forests, gardens, and next to roads. Scientists saw this frog sitting on plants near the ground. The female frog lays eggs in cracks in rocks or near grass. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists think this frog is not in danger of dying out because even though it does not live in a large place, only small parts of that place are in danger. It is also because this frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. Scientists say this frog could be in danger if climate change changes the places it lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
