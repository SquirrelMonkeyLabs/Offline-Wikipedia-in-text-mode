 "text": "Pachypleurosaurs were primitive sauropterygian reptiles that vaguely resembled aquatic lizards, and were limited to the Triassic period. They were long animals, ranging in size from 20 cm to about four metres in length, with small heads, long necks, paddle-like limbs, and long deep tails. The limb girdles are greatly reduced, so it is unlikely these animals could move about on land. The widely spaced peg-like teeth project at the front of the jaws, indicate that these animals fed on fish. Pachypleurosaurs are usually included among the Nothosaurs.Benton M.J. 2004.
