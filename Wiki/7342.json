Only later did Liverpool on the West become as important, with the growth of sea trading across the Atlantic. === Eboracum === The city was founded by the Romans as Eboracum in 71 AD. Its position where the rivers Ouse and Fosse converge was likely one of the reasons the site was chosen. It was later the capital of the kingdoms of Northumbria and Jorvik.
