 "text": "The Hebrew term Chumash (also Ḥumash, ) is a term for Torah in printed form, unlike the Torah scroll. The word comes from the Hebrew word for five, (). A more formal term is Ḥamishah Ḥumshei Torah, meaning \"five fifths of Torah\". It is a Hebrew name for the Five Books of Moses, also known by the Latinised Greek term Pentateuch in common printed editions. The five books are: Beraishis (Genesis), Shemot (Exodus), Vayikra (Leviticus), Bamidbar (Numbers), and Devarim (Deuteronomy). ==Other websites== * Chumash on Judaism 101 * Chumash (5 Books Of Moses) on Judaism.com * Torah Summary & Analysis Category:Judaism Category:Bible",
