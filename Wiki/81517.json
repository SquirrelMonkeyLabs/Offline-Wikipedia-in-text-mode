 "text": "Daspletosaurus was a large meat-eating dinosaur that was 26-33 feet (8-10 m) long and weighed perhaps 2-3 tons (3000 kg). It had tiny, horn-like ornaments behind its eyes, and its arms were a bit longer than those of its more famous relative T. rex. It may have been an ancestor of Tyrannosaurus. This bipedal hunter lived in marshes by streams in what is now Alberta, Canada, during the Middle Cretaceous period, 76-72 million years ago. It may have preyed upon Triceratops. It was named by D.A. Russell in 1970. In both Dinosaur Planet and Planet Dinosaur, Daspletosaurus was identified as its original species, Daspletosaurus horneri. In the Dinosaur King television series, it was named as Daspletosaurus torosus. == Popular media == Daspletosaurus has appeared in some TV series, novels and movies for a long time.
