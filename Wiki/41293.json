 "text": "Homework, or a homework assignment, is a set of tasks assigned to students by their teachers to be completed outside the classroom. Common homework assignments may include required reading, a writing or typing project, mathematical exercises to be completed, information to be read before a test, or other skills to be practiced. The effects of homework are debated, since it lowers self esteem. It also may not actually help students since everyone learns differently. Generally speaking, homework does not help young children. Homework may help older students, especially low-achieving students. However, homework also creates stress for students and parents, and reduces the amount of time that students can spend in other activities.Cooper, Harris; Robinson, Jorgianne C. & Patall, Erika A. 2006. Does homework improve academic achievement? A synthesis of research, 1987-2003. Review of Educational Research. 76 (1): 1â€“62. Homework dates back to the 1900s, though it may have existed from earlier. == References == Category:Learning Category:Education",
