ISBN 0-8047-1254-9 ==Early history== === Hieroglyphs in Egypt === By 2700 BC, the ancient Egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the consonants of their language. A 23rd seems to have been for word-initial or word-final vowels. The first purely alphabetic script may have been developed around 2000 BC for Semitic workers in central Egypt.Hamilton, Gordon J. 2002. W.F. Albright and early alphabetic writing, Near Eastern Archaeology 65, #1 (March 2002): 35-42. page 39-49. Over the next 500 years, it spread north. All later alphabets around the world have either descended from it or been inspired by one of its descendants.Gaur, Albertine 1992. A history of writing. The British Library.
