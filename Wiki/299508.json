 "text": "Euphorbia is genus of over 2000 plant species. It is one of the biggest genera in the plant kingdom. Common names include poinsettia, spurge, or just Euphorbia. Many of these plants have developed a defence against herbivory: They are poisonous when swallowed. The Euphorbia family is in the group Malpighiales, one of the largest groups in the plant kingdoms. The euphorbia family also includes crotons (Codiaeum), castor bean plants (ricinus), and hogworts (Croton). Euphorbias are commonly plants that do not need a lot of water, like cacti. Pointsettias are commonly called Christmas flowers. There are many smaller genera in Euphorbia. Ricinus (castor bean plant) is very toxic. It is the second most poisonous plant after Nerium oleander (family Apocynaceae). Category:Euphorbiaceae",
