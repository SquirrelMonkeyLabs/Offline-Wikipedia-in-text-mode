 "text": "United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, or USAMO, is a highly selective (only very good people take it) mathematics competition that takes place in the United States. The first USAMO was in 1972. It is the final round of the AMC series of contests. The United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad (USAJMO) was created in 2010 to recognize top scorers based on their AMC10-based index (score). Qualifying for the USAMO is considered one of the most prestigious, or best, awards for high school students in the United States, with only 264 students qualifying in 2013 out of over 350,000 students competing. Top scorers on the USAMO are invited to the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program to represent the United States at the International Mathematical Olympiad. == AMC Competition Series == === Competitions === The AMC Competition Series consists of multiple tests to determine the 6 people that will represent the United States in the International Mathematical Olympiad: * AMC 8/10/12 is available for everyone who is not over 8th, 10th, or 12th grade, respectively. * AIME can only be taken by people who have done very well on the AMC 10 and 12. * USAMO can only be taken by people who have done very well on the AIME and AMC 12. === MOP === Mathematical Olympiad Program, is an intense summer program for the top scorers in the USAMO. In MOP, students take tests called TSTST and TST. 6 top scorers will represent the United States at the IMO. == References == Category:Mathematics competitions Category:United States",
