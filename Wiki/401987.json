In 1666, he went to Trinity College, Oxford, but did not take a degree. His first tragedy was Cambyses, King of Persia (1667). It was the first English play to have its climax reached in a musical scene with an original score. It is believed to be the first play printed in England with illustrations.Encyclopedia of British writers, 16th and 17th centuries. (2005). Book Builders LLC. pp. 349-350.
