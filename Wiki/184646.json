 "text": "Woodford is a London Underground station in Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, United Kingdom. The station is on the Central Line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill. The station is also a terminus (an ending point) for services from Hainault by way of Chigwell. ==History== The station was opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton. It was changed by the successor company, the Great Eastern Railway, to include services to Ilford by way of the Fairlop Loop that was opened in 1903. After 1923 the station came under the control of the London & North Eastern Railway until it was given to the London Passenger Transport Board (LT) on 14 December 1947 as part of the extension of the Central Line services of the London Underground. The station was a terminus for the Central Line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle towards Epping, until electric services began as far as Loughton (and around the 'loop' to Hainault) on 21 November 1948. ==Gallery== Image:Woodford station north.JPG|Looking north (\"eastbound\") from eastbound platform Image:Woodford stn north.jpg|Looking north from footbridge (vandal-proof fence) Image:Woodford stn south.jpg|Looking south from footbridge (vandal-proof fence) Image:Woodford stn look south.jpg|Looking south (\"westbound\") from eastbound platform Image:Woodford stn roundel.jpg|Roundel on third (bay) platform ==Related pages== *List of London Underground stations ==References== Category:Central line stations Category:1856 establishments in Europe Category:1850s establishments in England",
