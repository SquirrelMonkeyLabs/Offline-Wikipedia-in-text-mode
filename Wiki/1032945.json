It happens every two years and includes teams of players under the age of 20 from different countries who are part of FIFA. Costa Rica hosted the tournament this time. They were also supposed to host it in 2020, but it got canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the second time Costa Rica hosted a FIFA tournament, the first being the 2014 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. Japan was the defending champion from the previous tournament. The first match of the tournament was between Costa Rica and Australia, played at Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica in San José. The final took place on 28th August 2022. Something special happened in this tournament: it was the first time in the history of FIFA youth tournaments (both for men and women) where the same two teams met again in the final, two times in a row. == Qualified teams == In the final tournament, there are a total of 16 teams that participate. One team automatically qualifies because they are the host, and in this case, it's Costa Rica. The other 15 teams qualify through six continental competitions.
