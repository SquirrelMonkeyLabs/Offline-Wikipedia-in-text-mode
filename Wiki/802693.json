Minahan â€“ Americans of European descent (Page: 17-18) This term includes people who are descended from the first European settlers in America as well as people who are descended from more recent European arrivals. European Americans are the largest panethnic group (or, variously considered an ethnic group in its own right) seconded historically to the indigenous tribes that were colonized by European Americans in the United States, at present. German, Irish, English, Italian, Polish, French and Scottish are the most common European ancestries in the United States. Eastern European immigrants such as Romanians are more recent. Many Roma and Jews have arrived to the United States via Europe. Some European Americans have African and Native American ancestry. 3.5% of European Americans carry African ancestry. In South Carolina and Louisiana, around 12% of European Americans have at least 1% African ancestry. ==Related pages== *American German *White Americans == References == Notes Category:Ethnic groups in the United States",
