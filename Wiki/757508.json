 "text": "\"Bella ciao\" (; \"Goodbye beautiful\") is an Italian protest folk song. It was created to protest against harsh working conditions in the paddy fields of North Italy. The song was later made as an anthem of the anti-fascist resistance by the Italian partisans between 1943 and 1945 during the Italian Resistance, against the Nazi Germany. Versions of \"Bella ciao\" are sung worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance. In 2017 and 2018, the song became popular because of the singing of \"Bella ciao\" multiple times in the Spanish television series Money Heist. ==References== Category:19th- century songs Category:Folk songs Category:History of Italy Category:Songs in Italian",
