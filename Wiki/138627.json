 "text": "Ravenscraig is an area of land in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It used to be the site for steelworks. Ravenscraig used to have the largest steel mill in Western Europe. Ravenscraig was closed in 1992, and is now almost completely gone. Ravenscraig is now at the start of a big redevelopment by Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd, Scottish Enterprise and Corus, to create a full new town. == Location == Ravenscraig is very easy to get to. More than two—thirds of Scotland’s population live within 90 minutes drive. Located in North Lanarkshire, Ravenscraig is between the towns of Wishaw and Motherwell, who house a population of over 60,000. Ravenscraig lies only a few minutes drive from both the M74 and the M8 motorways which lead to Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland's two biggest cities. == History == Another steel maker, Colvilles, decided to expand their business in July 1954. They were the largest steel manufacturer before World War II.Campbell, R. H. (1958). Iron and Steel. Chapter 5, In: Cunnison, J. and Gilfillan, J. B. S. (Editors) (1958). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, Volume V, The City of Glasgow. Glasgow: William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd. In 1954, Colvilles began the first stages of development in Ravenscraig, that turned Ravenscraig from an empty field into a site for steelworks. By 1957 most of the machinery was built and by 1959 the full building work was complete. When Ravenscraig closed in 1993, that was the end of most steel making in Scotland.Stratton, Michael and Trinder, Barry (2000). Twentieth Century Industrial Archaeology. London: E & FN Spon. . 770 jobs were lost, along with another 10,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly linked.Still time for a new strategy.

Part of the development will be to make new habitats for the wildlife that live in the area, such as deer, foxes, hares, otters, badgers, watervoles, butterflies and many birds. An \"Ecological Clerk of Works\" has been appointed to make sure the building works do not harm the wildlife. It is hoped that the £29million sports complex will be used as a training camp for the 2012 London Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.Scottish Government - (£29m for Ravenscraig sports complex) There are many people who disagree with the building work.
