 "text": "Opération Lamantin (French for manatee) was a December 1977 – July 1978 military operation by France with the help of the Mauritanian government, in its war against Sahrawi guerrilla fighters of the Polisario Front. It supported independence for Western Sahara. Airstrikes were launched in the provinces, but the results of the operation were not significant. France used Jaguar combat aircraft from Dakar Airbase. The bombings were targeted in the rail mines in Zouérat to the coast of Nouadhibou, which were blocked by Polisario. ==References== Category:Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Category:1977 in Africa Category:1978 in Africa Category:Military of France Category:Mauritania Category:Wars involving Africa",
