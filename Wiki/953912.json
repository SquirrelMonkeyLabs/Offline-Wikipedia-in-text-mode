 "text": "The Shiny Show is a British quiz show for children. It was originally broadcast on CBeebies between 11th February 2002 and 30th July 2002 and was repeated until 2nd June 2009 and 23rd January 2017. The show was hosted by three puppet animals - Tigs the tiger, Dogsby the dog and Mukka the monkey. In each episode one of them was chosen to host the quiz. Then they would show a film about something and ask questions about it later. If a player anwsers right, they earn a shiny - a shiny object. Each quiz had three rounds. The winner (the one who got more shinies) would earn a super-shiny at the end as a prize. Most episodes can be viewed on The Shiny Show â€“ Official Channel on YouTube. == References == Category:2002 British television series debuts",
