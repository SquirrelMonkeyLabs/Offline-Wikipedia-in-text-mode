The idea is to inspire hope amongst the chaos that may be happening around you. If the ground was breaking beneath your feet, your first reaction may be to run and jump to safety, and it's that moment where you are suspended in the air that I am focusing on. A still frame where you're not sure if the person is falling or flying. It's about freeing yourself from the things that are breaking or falling apart in your life, and inspiring a sense of hope from the desperation\". ==Reception== The album has been received rather well by critics. Alternative Press rated the album 4/5 stars saying \"Collide with the Sky is PTV's best work to date\". They praised the album for the power pop hooks on \"Props & Mayhem\", saying that you should download \"Tangled in the Great Escape\". AbsolutePunk commented that the album is \"sure to continue Pierce the Veil's steady ascent to the top of their league\", concluding that \"[it] proves Pierce the Veil are seemingly still one step ahead of everyone else when it comes to concocting energetic slices of post-hardcore and that they wonâ€™t be dropping the ball any time soon.\" ==Personnel== ===Pierce the Veil=== * Vic Fuentes - lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, piano * Mike Fuentes - drums, percussion, backing vocals * Jaime Preciado - bass guitar, unclean vocals * Tony Perry - lead guitar ==Release history== The album was released in the United Kingdom on July 16, 2012.
