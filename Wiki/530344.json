Retrieved March 2011 (APPG) is a grouping in the British Parliament that is made up of politicians from all political parties. If a parliament consists of both a lower house and an upper house, all-party parliamentary groups can usually include members of both houses. In the British Parliament, for example, APPGs include members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In the British Parliament, an associate parliamentary group is similar to an all-party parliamentary group except that it is made up of not only members of the House of Commons or Lords but can also include members from outside Parliament. ==References== Category:Political organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Parliament of the United Kingdom",
