Lucas tries to steal a jellybean from his house for them with the help of two ants. Lucas tells them that he’s not actually a giant but is actually pretty short and that another boy named Sid is mean to him. When Lucas breaks into the house with the ants, his father tries to hit them with a flyswatter so they run away. Lucas comes to the Ant queen with a jellybean so she lets him become as big as a human again. When he next sees Sid, he notices that Sid has been shrunk down to the size of an ant.
