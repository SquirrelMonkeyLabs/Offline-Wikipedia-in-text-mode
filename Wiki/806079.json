She was the first female Prime Minister of the UK. The election happened because of a vote of no confidence in the James Callaghan passing by one vote in the House of Commons on the 28 March. This vote happened because Thatcher had brought it forward. It forced the election to happen. ==References== * * * * * ** * Category:1979 in Europe Category:1970s elections in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom general elections",
