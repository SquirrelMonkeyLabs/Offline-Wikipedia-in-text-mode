 "text": "Charles III, Duke of Bourbon (February 17, 1490 - May 6, 1527) was a French prince from the House of Bourbon. ==Life== Charles was the second son of Gilbert, Duke of Montpensier and his wife Clara Gonzaga. In 1505, he married Suzanne, the daughter of Peter II, Duke of Bourbon. By the age of 15, he became the richest noble in Europe. Charles fought at the Battle of Marignano in 1515 and King Francis I took away Charles's lands after the death of Charles's wife Suzanne in 1521 because Charles did not want to marry Francis's mother Louise of Savoy. This made Charles very angry at King Francis and caused Charles to seek an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor and also with King Henry VIII of England. In 1527, Charles's army participated in the Sack of Rome, where Charles himself was killed. ==References== Category:French princes Category:French military people",
