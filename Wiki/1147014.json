 "text": "The Beco do Pinto, also known as Beco do Colégio, is a historic passage located in the center of São Paulo, Brazil. It connects Roberto Simonsen Street and Bittencourt Rodrigues Street. During colonial times, it was used for the transit of people and animals between Largo da Sé and the Tamanduateí River meadow. ==History== * Named after: Brigadeiro José Joaquim Pinto de Moraes Leme, who owned a nearby house. * 1821: Brigadeiro Pinto closed the passage with a gate, but the City Hall reopened it the same year. * 1826: The passage was officially named Beco do Colégio. * 1834: The Marquesa de Santos bought the nearby Solar and asked for the gate and wall to be rebuilt. * 1912: The passage lost its function after Carmo Street was connected to Rangel Pestana Avenue. Today, the Beco do Pinto is part of the Museu da Cidade de São Paulo and is managed by Casa da Imagem. It features contemporary art installations and is an important cultural and historical site. == References == Category:São Paulo",
