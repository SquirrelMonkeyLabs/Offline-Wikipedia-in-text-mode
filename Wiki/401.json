It is one of four months to have 30 days. No other month of any year begins on the same day of the week as June: this month and May are the only two months with this property. June ends on the same day of the week as March every year, as each other's last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.In common years, June starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the previous year, and in leap years, April and July of the previous year.

Every year, June starts on the same day of the week as February of the following year, as each other's first days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In years immediately before common years, June starts on the same day of the week as March and November of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, August of the following year.

June is one of two months to have a solstice (the other is December, its seasonal equivalent in both hemispheres), and in this month the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere is turned towards the Sun, meaning that June 20 or June 21 is the Northern Summer Solstice and the Southern Winter Solstice. This means that this date would have the most daylight of any day in the Northern hemisphere, and the least in the Southern Hemisphere. There are 24 hours of daylight at the North Pole and 24 hours of darkness at the South Pole. ==Events in June== * In the Catholic Church the month of June is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.https://books.google.it/books?id=LzctzwEACAAJ&dq;=June+Sacred+Heart&hl;=it&sa;=X&redir;_esc=y * On June 11, there came suddenly an unexpected incident where JJ Alviso suddenly got shouted at and scolded by his Mom in the year 2023.
