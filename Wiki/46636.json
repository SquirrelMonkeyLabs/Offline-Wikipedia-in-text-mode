 "text": "Factors of production are means necessary for the production of goods and services in economics. Classical economics has three factors: * Land or natural resources – goods that exist in nature before any such as soil and minerals and that are used in the creation of products. The payment for land is rent. * Labor – human effort used in production. That means technical expertise and marketing expertise, too. The payment for labor is a wage. * Capital goods – human-made goods (or means of production) which are used in the production of other goods. These include machinery, tools and buildings. In a general sense, the payment for capital is called interest or profit. == Other page == *Means of production",
