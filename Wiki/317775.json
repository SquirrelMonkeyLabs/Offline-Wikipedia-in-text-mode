 "text": "Terraria is an action-adventure, RPG, Sandbox indie game released by independent game studio Re-Logic on May 16, 2011, originally available only on Microsoft Windows. It is the 9th best selling video game of all time. The Windows, macOS, Linux, Steam Deck, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch versions are still updated and currently on version 1.4.9.5. The Wii U, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Windows Phone, Google Stadia, and Nintendo 3DS versions are no longer updated. They are on version 1.08 or 1.09 and considered the Legacy console versions. Terraria is in a 2D, pixelated style similar to Mario or Mega Man. == Gameplay == The game begins with the player creating a custom character, and then creating a world. When making a world, the size, difficulty, and type of world infection can be picked. The player begins with only basic copper tools, which are used to gather wood, mine blocks, and attack monsters. From these basic tools, the player moves up to stronger armor and weapons by creating them with materials found around the world such as dirt, stone, copper ore, wood, and many more. Players need the right tools to mine certain blocks. == Bosses == There are many bosses in Terraria. A boss is an enemy that is much stronger and larger than regular enemies. At the beginning of the game, there are 4 bosses to defeat. They are the Eye of Cthulhu, Brain of Cthulhu/Eater of Worlds (depending on what kind of world infection you choose), Skeletron, and the Wall of Flesh. Once the Wall of Flesh is defeated, many more bosses are available since the world has entered Hardmode. They are the Twins, the Destroyer, Skeletron Prime, Plantera, Golem, the Lunatic Cultist, and the final boss Moon Lord. There are also a few bosses that are not necessary for game progression, such as King Slime, Queen slime, Queen Bee, the Empress of Light, Duke Fishron, and the mini-boss Dreadnautilus. They are not required to complete the game, but each boss drops useful items that will make progression easier. Some bosses are not included in the modern console versions, but are available on the Legacy versions. They are Ocram, Lepus, and Turkor the Ungrateful. == Events == There are many events that can happen while playing. Before entering hardmode, a Goblin Invasion or Blood moon may happen. After entering hardmode, many more events become possible, like Pirate Invasions, Solar Eclipses, and Martian Invasions. Each event has different enemies the player must defeat for it to be over. == Other websites == Official Terraria Website Official Terraria Wiki Terraria on Steam ==References== ;Notes Category:2011 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Construction and management simulation games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo Network games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Open- world video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Sandbox games Category:Survival video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Wii U games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox One games",
