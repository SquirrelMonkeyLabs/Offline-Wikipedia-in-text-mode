She appears in the movies Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and Black Widow (2021), as well as in the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021) voiced by Lake Bell. Romanoff is depicted as an expert spy and hand-to-hand combatant, trained in the Red Room from childhood to be a KGB assassin. This brought her under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar, and Clint Barton is sent to kill her but instead spared her life and recruited her into the organization. When Nick Fury activates the Avengers Initiative, she becomes a founding member. Following the fallout related to the Sokovia Accords, Romanoff became a fugitive and eventually reunites with her adopted family, including sister Yelena Belova, and they work together to destroy General Dreykov's Black Widow program. After Thanos erases half of all life, Romanoff leads the Avengers for five years until sacrificing herself to obtain the Soul Stone, successfully helping the Avengers restore trillions of lives across the universe. == Appearances == === Movie appearances === Year Movie Portrayed by 2010 Iron Man 2 Scarlett Johansson 2012 The Avengers 2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron 2016 Captain America: Civil War 2018 Avengers: Infinity War 2019 Avengers: Endgame 2021 Black Widow === Television appearances === Year Television series Seasons Episodes Portrayed by 2021-2024 What If...? 3 26 Lake Bell (voice) Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters Category:Marvel Comics movie characters",
