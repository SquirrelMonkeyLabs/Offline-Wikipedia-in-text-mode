The fire was started by the explosion of oxygen tanks meant for COVID-19 patients. There was a lack of fire detection systems which caused the fire to grow. Many of the COVID patients died as a result of being taken off their ventilators to help them escape the fire. ==References== Category:2021 fires in Asia Category:2020s explosions in Asia Category:2020s in Iraq Category:April 2021 events Hospital fire Category:Building and structure fires in Asia Category:Explosions in 2021",
