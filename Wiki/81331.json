Sheppard in 2000.IAUC 7555: Satellites of Jupiter 2001 January 5 (discovery)MPEC 2001-A29: S/2000 J 7, S/2000 J 8, S/2000 J 9, S/2000 J 10, S/2000 J 11 2001 January 15 (discovery and ephemeris) Dia is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 12,555,000 km in 287 days, at an inclination of 28Â° (to Jupiter's equator), and with an orbital eccentricity of 0.248.Sheppard, S.

McKinnon, Cambridge Planetary Science, Vol. 1, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, , 2004, pp. 263-280 The moon is included in the Himalia group.Sheppard, S. S.; Jewitt, D. C.; An abundant population of small irregular satellites around Jupiter, Nature, 423 (May 2003), pp. 261-263 After discovery it was lost for ten years because the orbit was poorly known. Recovery allowed much better precision. == References == # * Ephemeris IAU-MPC NSES # Mean orbital parameters NASA JPL == Other websites == * David Jewitt pages * Scott Sheppard pages Category:Jupiter's moons",
