 "text": "The INA Martyrs' Memorial Complex () is a war memorial complex in Moirang, Manipur. It is dedicated to the soldiers of the Indian National Army. It was built at Moirang where the Indian tricolor flag was first hoisted in the soil of India. The main feature of the complex is the replica of the INA's memorial in Singapore before its demolition by British Indian Army in 1945. The complex also houses the legendary INA War Museum along with a library and an auditorium. The life-size statue of Subhas Chandra Bose stands inside the complex. Work on the cenotaph itself began in October 1968 and was completed in September 1969. The complex was unveiled by Indira Gandhi, the then prime minister of India. Work on expanding the monument complex to present-day size was completed in 2005. The total cost in building the memorial was Rs 6.23 crores. A stone monument was also erected at the historic Moirang Kangla. It is the place where Colonel Shaukat Malik raised the flag of Azad Hind in April 1944. The Government of Manipur administered the site since 1985. Close to the complex is the peace memorial at the Red Hills (Maibam Lokpa Ching), raised by the Government of Japan. == Related pages == * Battle of Imphal == References == == Other websites == * INA Martyrs Memorial(INA) artnculturemanipur.gov.in * Netaji's war speech to be played at INA complex for visitors timesofindia.com * President Kovind offers tribute to INA martyrs thepeopleschronicle.in Category:Buildings and structures in Manipur",
