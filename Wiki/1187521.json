 "text": "The Sycamore Gap tree was a sycamore maple tree (Acer pseudoplatanus) next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, England, United Kingdom. It is locally known as the \"Robin Hood Tree\" for its use in the 1991 movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, which made it one of the most famous trees in the United Kingdom and became famous around the world. A popular tourist attraction, the tree was described as one of the most photographed in the country and the most photographed point in Northumberland. The tree won the 2016 England Tree of the Year award. It was illegally cut down in the middle of the night by two men in an act of vandalism on 28 Septemper 2023. It was cut all the way through, at its trunk. However, it did not die and has later sprouted from the stump. In April 2024, Daniel Graham, who ran a business near Carlisle, and Adam Carruthers, a mechanic living in a caravan in Kirkbride, were charged with \"criminal damage\" to the tree and to Hadrian's Wall. On 15 May 2024 the two men appeared at court in Newcastle upon Tyne. One entered pleas of not guilty to both charges and the second entered no plea. In June 2024 the second man entered two not guilty pleas. Both men were released on bail. The trial began on 28 April 2025. They were found guily during on 9 May 2025; however, sentencing has not yet happened (as of early May 2025). == References == ==Other websites== Category:Trees Category:Geography of Northumberland",
