 "text": "The Saint Piran's Cross, also called the Cross of Saint Piran, is a white cross on a black background. After the middle ages, it became associated with Saint Piran. The earliest known description of the flag as the Standard of Cornwall was written in 1838. It is used by some Cornish people as a symbol of their identity. The flag is attributed to Saint Piran, a 5th-century Cornish abbot. One early use of a white cross and black background design is the 15th- century coat of arms of the Saint-Peran family.P.
