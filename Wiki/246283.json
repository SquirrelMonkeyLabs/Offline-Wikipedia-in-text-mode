 "text": "Gifted education is a term for special ways to educate (teach) children who have been identified as gifted. There is no definition of a gifted student which everyone agrees on. Gifted and talented education has a long history of thousands of years. Plato (c. 427â€“c. 347 BCE) was in favour of providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women.Colangelo, N., & Davis, G. (1997). Handbook of gifted education (2nd ed.). New York: Allyn and Bacon. p. 5 In China's Tang Dynasty (580-618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who showed creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage. In 2011, the National Association for Gifted Children published a position paper that stated what a gifted student is. The word \"gifted,\" describes people who demonstrate outstanding aptitude or competence in one or more domains. An \"aptitude\" is defined as an exceptional ability to learn or reason. \"Competence\" is defined as documented performance or achievement in the top 10% of the population.National Association for Gifted Children.
