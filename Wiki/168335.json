He has won many Tony and Grammy awards throughout his career, including one for Natasha, Pierre and the great Comet of 1812. He is playing Sweeney Todd now. == Early life and education == Groban was born in Los Angeles, California, to Jack Groban, a businessman, and Lindy Groban (née Johnston), a school teacher. His father is a descendant of Jewish immigrants from Poland and Ukraine, but converted from Judaism to Christianity upon marrying his mother. His mother's ancestry includes English, German, and Norwegian; one of her own grandfathers had also been Jewish. His parents are Episcopalians. Groban first sang in public when he was in the seventh grade. His music teacher chose him to sing a solo of \"S'wonderful\" at the school's cabaret night, where he sang alone on stage for the first time. At this time, he was more focused on acting, playing Tevye in his high school's production of Fiddler on the Roof. In the summers of 1997 and 1998, he also attended the Interlochen Center for the Arts Camp in Michigan, majoring in musical theater, and began taking vocal lessons. He went on to attend the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts as a theater major and graduated in 1999. He was admitted to and briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University, intent on studying musical theater. Four months into his first semester, Groban was offered a recording contract and left college to pursue a singing career. He is playing Sweeney Todd, and he claims to be a pescetarian… because of meat pies ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:Singer- songwriters from California Category:Singers from Los Angeles Category:American Grammy Award winners",
