 "text": "The Tour of Life (or Kate Bush Tour) was the only concert tour by English singer Kate Bush. The tour was made for her first two albums, The Kick Inside and Lionheart. It happened in April and May 1979. It was the first concert ever to use a wireless headset microphone. The device was invented by Gordon Paterson so Bush could dance on stage. The tour's lighting worker, Bill Duffield, died after the first concert because he fell from a stage and seating structure. ==Set list== #\"Moving\" #\"The Saxophone Song\" #\"Room for the Life\" #\"Them Heavy People\" #\"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\" #\"Egypt\" #\"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\" #\"Violin\" #\"The Kick Inside\" ;Interlude: John Carder Bush poetry reading # * \"In the Warm Room\" #\"Fullhouse\" (not sang during the concerts at Hammersmith Odeon) #\"Strange Phenomena\" #\"Hammer Horror\" (not live) #\"Kashka From Baghdad\" ;Interlude: Chanting # * \"Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake\" #\"Wow\" #\"Coffee Homeground\" (with extended instrumental introduction) #\"In Search of Peter Pan\" ;Interlude: John Carder Bush poetry reading # * \"Symphony in Blue\" (including \"Gymnopédie 1\" by Erik Satie) #\"Feel It\" (with instrumental introduction) #\"Kite\" # * \"James and the Cold Gun\" ;Encore 1 # * \"Oh England My Lionheart\" ;Encore 2 # * \"Wuthering Heights\" == Credits == These are the people listed in the Kate Bush Tour programme sold at the concerts.
