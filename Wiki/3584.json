Typical drinks for humans include water, tea, milk, coffee, juice, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks. All drinks are mainly water. All living things need water to live. If we don't get enough water, we will dehydrate, and likely die. Plants take in water through their roots, which are underground. Most land animals get water by drinking. == Places that have no water == Deserts are places that have very little water. The only area in the desert that has water is an oasis.
