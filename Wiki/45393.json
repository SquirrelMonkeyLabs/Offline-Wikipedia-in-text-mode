 "text": "A paddle is a tool used for pushing against liquids, either for propulsion in a boat or for mixing liquids. Paddles commonly used in canoes consist of a wooden, fibreglass or metal rod (the shaft) with a handle on one end and a rigid sheet (the blade) on the other end. Paddles for use in kayaks are longer, with a blade on each end, and usually no handles. == Related pages == * Oar Category:Tools",
