Later, a person named Ernesto Schiaparelli, who was in charge of the Egyptian Museum in Turin, dug up this tomb. == Tomb == During the Coptic period, the tomb was changed into a chapel. In the first room, there are pictures of 41 judges on the left wall, each with a feather on their head. Nebettawy is shown giving a statue to a seated figure wearing two feathers on their head. In the second room, Nebettawy is shown in front of Horus and she has very important titles there: The Osiris, the King's Daughter, Great Royal Wife, Lady of the Two Lands, Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt.Porter, Bertha and Moss, Rosalind, Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Statues, Reliefs and Paintings Volume I: The Theban Necropolis, Part 2.
