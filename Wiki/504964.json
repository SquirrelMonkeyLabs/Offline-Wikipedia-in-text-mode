The term was coined in 1960.\"Cyborgs and Space ,\" in Astronautics (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. D.S. Halacy's Cyborg: evolution of the superman in 1965 spoke of a \"new frontier\" that was \"not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' â€“ a bridge...between mind and matter\".D.S.

While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism and the term \"cybernetic organism\" has been applied loosely to all sorts of things.
