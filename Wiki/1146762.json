 "text": "The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States marked the beginning of Donald Trump's second and final term as president and JD Vance's only term as vice president. The ceremony took place on Monday, January 20, 2025, inside the United States Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C. The ceremony was moved indoors due because of cold weather. It is the first indoor inauguration ceremony since the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1985. The event was the 60th presidential inauguration. Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh administered the oath of office to JD Vance. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to Donald Trump. Trump's wife, Melania, held two Bibles for Trump to place his left hand on while reciting the oath, in accordance with custom, but he did not do so. This is merely a tradition; incoming presidents are not required to place their hand on the Bibles. Former United States Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, former Vice Presidents Dan Quayle and Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, all members of the Supreme Court of the United States, some billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk and different foreign representatives, including Javier Milei of Argentina, Giorgia Meloni of Italy, Daniel Noboa of Ecuador and Han Zheng of China attended the inauguration. Trump's inauguration marked the first time in U.S. history that a president-elect formally welcomes foreign leaders to the ceremony. ==References== Category:Donald Trump Trump, Donald Category:January 2025 events Category:2025 in the United States",
