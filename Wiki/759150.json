Physical distancing actions were introduced on 12 March. ==Cases== The first death caused by COVID-19 was documented on 26 February 2020. Most confirmed cases that were traced to outside Norway were Norwegian tourists returning from Austria and Italy. ==Testing== Norway had performed 208,874 tests and reported 8,168 confirmed cases and 229 deaths. One of the major reasons why the mortality rate was lower than in other European countries (such as Italy, Spain, the UK) was the high number of tests performed in Norway. ==References== Category:2020s in Norway Norway Category:2020 in Norway Category:2021 in Norway",
