 "text": "The Railroad Valley springfish (Crenichthys nevadae) is a fish that lives in North America. It lives in Nevada in the United States of America. ==Size== This fish is 6 cm long. ==Home== People have seen the Railroad Valley springfish in six places where the water comes out of the ground hot. The fish came there as Railroad Lake dried up. Currently, they still live in Big, North, Hay Corral, and Reynolds Springs, but they have disappeared from the other places. People have also brought them to live in ponds in other places, for example Sadaville, Creek Canyon, and Chimney Spring. Scientists have not checked if it has a bad effect on the places people brought it. ==Threats== It is endangered because people brought other fish to the places where it lives. It is also endangered because human beings take water out of their streams and ponds, because human beings change the places where it lives, and because cows and other livestock step on the fish when they come to their ponds to drink water. ==References== Category:Cyprinodontiformes Category:Animals of North America",
