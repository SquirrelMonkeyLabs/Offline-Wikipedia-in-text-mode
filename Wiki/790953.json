 "text": "Bluey (7 June 1910 â€“ 14 November 1939) was an Australian Cattle Dog. Bluey's owners were Les and Esma Hall from Dallas, Texas. Guinness World Records says that Bluey is the oldest known dog. Bluey lived for 29 years and 5 months. Another dog named Chilla was said to have lived for 32 years.World's oldest pooch dies, Beaver County Times, March 13, 1984. Retrieved September 19, 2020. A study was done to see if Australian Cattle Dogs lived longer than other dog breeds. 100 dogs were surveyed. The study showed that Australian Cattle Dogs lived on average for 13.41 years, almost a year longer than other dog breeds. In the end, the study says that Bluey and Chilla should be seen as distinct from other dogs instead of showing longer lives for Australian Cattle Dogs.Lee, P. (2011). Longevity of the Australian Cattle Dog: Results of a 100-Dog Survey. ACD Spotlight, Vol. 4, Issue 1, Spring 2011, 96-105. http://www.acdspotlight.com/ Three other dogs named Max, Bella, and Maggie were said by their owners to have lived longer than Bluey. Guinness World Records did not put any of the dogs in their book because the dog owners could not verify that fact. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Individual dogs",
