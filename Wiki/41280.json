 "text": "A rhombus is a unique geometric shape characterized by having four sides of equal length. The word rhombus comes from the Greek word rhombos, meaning \"spinning top\". While the angles within a rhombus are not always 90 degrees, one important property is that opposite angles are always equal. This gives the rhombus a certain symmetry, even though it differs from a square, which has four 90-degree angles. The diagonals of a rhombus, which are the lines that connect opposite corners, cross each other at a 90-degree angle. Additionally, these diagonals not only intersect at right angles but also bisect (or split) the angles of the rhombus in half, creating smaller, equal angles at each corner. == Finding the Area of a Rhombus == The area of a rhombus can be easily calculated using the following formula: \\\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{d_1 \\times d_2}{2} \\\\] Here, \\\\(d_1\\\\) and \\\\(d_2\\\\) represent the lengths of the two diagonals. Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, they essentially divide the rhombus into four right-angled triangles, and this formula reflects that division. == Differences == Although a rhombus and a square both have four sides of equal length, there are key differences between the two. In a rhombus, the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees, whereas a square has four right angles. In fact, while a square is a special case of a rhombus (where all angles are 90 degrees), not all rhombuses are squares. This distinction makes the rhombus a more flexible shape, with a wider range of applications. == Applications == Rhombuses are often used in design, art, and architecture due to their symmetry and aesthetic appeal. The shapeâ€™s equal sides and distinctive angles can be seen in various patterns, tiles, and decorative elements in buildings. The fact that the diagonals bisect the angles at right angles adds to the visual interest and symmetry, making the rhombus a popular choice in many creative fields. == References == Category:Polygons",
