 "text": "Geometry Dash (also known as GD or GMD) is a rhythm-based platformer game developed and published by RobTop Games. It started being sold for $2.00 USD on August 13 2013, and is a 2D platform game that involves dodging obstacles (spikes, walls, and creatures) in a series of levels. Players can create levels in the level editor, and play levels made by other players. There are many tools for creating levels: rings (commonly just called orbs) that let you jump mid air, pads that boost you up higher, and triggers that allow the level creator t The player moves towards the right of the screen automatically in the game's classic mode, wheres the player has full control of their movement in platformer mode (released in the latest update, 2.2). There are gamemodes that the player can turn into: Ship, Ball, UFO, Wave, Robot, Spider, and Swing. All of these gamemodes have unique physics, and their own customisable icons! There are also portals which do not make you a gamemode. For example: upside-down portal, speed portals, the mirror portal and the miniature portal. There are 22 main levels that Robtop made to try and set the player up, also introducing what every update brings. Geometry Dash is available on Steam, and Mobile. == Gameplay == The player can use the keyboard, touch screen, controller, mouse, etc. to control the icon. Unlocking new icons requires collecting each of the games different currencies, and can be done by completing quests, lists and certain levels (daily, weekly, gauntlet) for diamonds, completing map packs and official levels for secret coins (or star rated levels for user coins) and star rated / official levels for stars (with platformer levels rewarding moons instead). Beating or progressing any star rated level also grant mana orbs (a feature introduced in update 2.1). The Geometry Dash user-made levels range in difficulty from auto to demon (at its peak, extreme demon) with thousands of levels to explore. == References == == Other websites == * Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Music video games Category:Platform games Category:Side- scrolling video games Category:Video game series Category:Windows games",
