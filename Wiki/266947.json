 "text": "The Synod of Hippo was the synod of 393 that was held in Hippo Regius in northern Africa during the early Christian Church. Other synods were held in 394, 397, 401 and 426. Some were attended by St. Augustine. The synod of 393 is best known for two things. First, for the first time a council of bishops listed and agreed a canon of Sacred Scripture that is the same as the modern Orthodox and Roman Catholic canon. The canon was later agreed at the Council of Carthage. ==References== * New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia - African Synods * Schaff - The Code of Canons of the African Church A.D. 419 Hippo Category:390s",
