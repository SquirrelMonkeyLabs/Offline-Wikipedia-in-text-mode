 "text": "Quebec City (Ville de Québec in French) is the capital of the Canadian province of Quebec. It is the second largest city in Quebec, behind Montreal. It is known for its winter fair, beautiful churches, and an old hotel called Château Frontenac. It is next to the Saint Lawrence River. There are around 550,000 people in the city, and over 800,000 people in the metropolitan area. The city was created in 1608 at a First Nations (native) Canadian place called Stadacona. People came from France to live there. The English captured the city in 1759 during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The walls made to keep the city safe are still there. The walls that surrounded Old Quebec are the only remaining fortified city walls that still exist in the Americas north of Mexico. They were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. Quebec City has a humid continental climate (Dfb in the Köppen climate classification). Most people in Quebec City speak French. == Media == Quebec City Stations SRC Radio CFCM TVA CBVT SRC CIVQ Tele-Quebec CFAP TQS CHMG Telemag ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:World Heritage Sites in Canada",
