 "text": "Carey Price (born August 16, 1987 in Anahim Lake, British Columbia) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He is currently under contract with the Montreal Canadians of the National Hockey League (NHL). Price was considered to be one of the greatest goaltenders in the sport during his playing career. During the end of his playing career, Price struggled with substance abuse and injuries. On October 7, 2021, Price would enter the NHL/NHLPA Player Assistance Program to fight his addiction. Price would win the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for his comeback. An article in The Athletic stated that while Price wasn't officially retired, \"[Price] knows he will never play professional hockey again\" due to the multiple injuries he has had over his career and the surgery he would need to fix them. ==Awards== * WHL West First All-Star Team - 2006–07 * Del Wilson Trophy (WHL Top Goaltender) - 2006–07 * CHL Goaltender of the Year - 2006–07 * Jack A.
