Nolan ran for Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota as the running mate of Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson in the 2018 gubernatorial election. They lost in the August primary to Tim Walz and Peggy Flanagan. Nolan was born in Brainerd, Minnesota. He was inspired to run for politics because of his aunt, who was a lawyer.

On October 18, 2024, it was announced that Nolan died from heart disease at his home in Nisswa, Minnesota, at the age of 80. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Category:1943 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Deaths from cardiovascular disease Category:United States representatives from Minnesota Category:State legislators of the United States Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians",
