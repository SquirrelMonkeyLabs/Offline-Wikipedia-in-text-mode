He was born in London and was a member of the Liberal Democrats until 2013. In the 1980s he tried in vain to become an MP on behalf of the Social Democratic Party. He was the Member of Parliament for Eastleigh from May 2005 until February 2013. He was the United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change from May 2010 until February 2012.Chris Huhne quits cabinet over speeding claims charge, BBC News, 3 February 2012. When he was in that job, he decided on the most efficient ways of having electricity and other important resources in Britain. There was an article in the newspaper that said Huhne wanted to have more nuclear power stations. A lot of people think this is wrong. Huhne was married to Greek economist Vicky Pryce (born 1952) from 1984 until they separated in 2010 and divorced in 2011. Huhne and Pryce had three children together. ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:British columnists Category:Criminals from London Category:English prisoners Category:Liberal Democrats (UK) MPs Category:Members of the British House of Commons for English constituencies Category:Journalists from London Category:MEPs for the United Kingdom Category:Politicians from London Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Secretaries of State of the United Kingdom Category:Social Democratic Party (UK) people Category:UK MPs 2005–2010 Category:UK MPs 2010–2015",
