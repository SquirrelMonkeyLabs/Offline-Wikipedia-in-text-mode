 "text": "Neo-feudalism is the idea that some parts of modern society are becoming like the feudal system of the Middle Ages. In this system: * A small, powerful elite controls wealth and power. * Most people have fewer rights and little chance to improve their lives. * The rich act like lords, while regular people have to work for them with little protection. == Where does the term come from == The term neo-feudalism is used to describe how today’s world looks similar to medieval Europe. Some thinkers on both the Left and Right use it to criticize modern politics and economics. == Meaning == Neo-feudalism is linked to: * Big corporations and powerful elites controlling society. * The gap between rich and poor getting wider. * The loss of economic freedom for most people. * Fewer rights and protections for workers. Some experts say that large companies today act like the rulers of the past. They make their own rules, control resources, and limit what people can do—just like feudal lords. == Modern examples == * Tech Companies: A few big companies (like Amazon and Facebook) control much of the online world. * Wealth Inequality: The richest 1% own more wealth than the rest of society. * Job Insecurity: Many workers must take low-paying jobs with no security, similar to medieval serfs. == Neo- feudalism in popular culture == The novel Dune imagines a future ruled by powerful noble families. The World Economic Forum’s \"Great Reset\" plan has been criticized as creating a neo-feudal system.Mercola, Joseph (2021), The Truth About COVID-19: Exposing The Great Reset, Lockdowns, Vaccine Passports, and the New Normal, Chelsea Green Publishing.
