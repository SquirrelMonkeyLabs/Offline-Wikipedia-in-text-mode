 "text": "Phidias, or Pheidias (about 480430 BC), born in Athens, Greece (Ancient Times), was a sculptor, painter and architect. His statue of Zeus at Olympia was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. He also designed the statues of the goddess Athena on the Acropolis. These were the Athena Parthenos inside the Parthenon and the Athena Promachos, a bronze statue of Athena near the entrance to the Acropolis. Phidias was twice accused of stealing some of the costly materials he used. He was accused of taking some of the ivory for the Athena Parthenos; and at Olympia, of stealing some of the gold for Zeus' cloak. A false witness against Phidias testified. Phidias died in prison. Today, most critics and historians consider him one of the greatest of ancient Greek sculptors.Bertrand Russell, The History of Western Philosophy, Chapter 10, Protagoras, page 95 == References == Category:Sculptors Category:5th-century BC births Category:430s BC deaths Category:Ancient Greeks Category:Olympia",
