 "text": "The Huntsville Stars were a Minor League Baseball team from Huntsville, Alabama, that played from 1985 to 2014. They played baseball at the Double-A (AA) level, the second-most difficult level before Major League Baseball (MLB), against other baseball teams in the Southern League. Their home stadium was called Joe W. Davis Stadium. The Stars were partnered with two MLB teams: the Oakland Athletics (1985–1998) and Milwaukee Brewers (1999–2014). The team was named \"Stars\" because Huntsville, the city where the team played, is a part of the space industry (NASA operates the nearby Marshall Space Flight Center). The Stars began playing baseball in 1985. The Double-A Nashville Sounds were moved from Nashville, Tennessee, to Huntsville after the 1984 season. They stayed in Huntsville for 30 years. In 2015, the team was moved to be Biloxi, Mississippi, and called the Biloxi Shuckers. Huntsville won the Southern League championship three times. First, in 1985 as the Double-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. Second, in 1994 with Oakland. Third, in 2001 as the Double-A partner of the Milwaukee Brewers. ==References== ==Other websites== *Statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:Baseball teams in the United States",
