He was the only survivor of his family's execution at Auschwitz concentration camp. He was also known for suing the Institute for Historical Review for questioning if the Holocaust had happened in an American court. In 1981, because of his lawsuit, the Holocaust was legally declared a fact. Mermelstein was born in near present- day Munkacs, Ukraine. Mermelstein died from problems caused by COVID-19 on January 28, 2022 in Long Beach, California at the age of 95. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Holocaust survivors Category:Czechoslovak writers Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Writers from California Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in California Category:American autobiographers",
