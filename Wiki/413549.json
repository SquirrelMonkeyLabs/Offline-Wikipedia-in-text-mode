 "text": "\"Let It Be\" is a song by The Beatles, released in March 1970 as a single, and (in an alternate mix) as the title track of their album Let It Be. It was written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon. It was their final single before McCartney announced his departure from the band (by that time, Lennon had already left). Both the Let It Be album and the US single \"The Long and Winding Road\" were released after McCartney's announced departure from and subsequent break-up of the group. \"Let It Be\" holds the number-one spot on \"The Fans' Top 10\" poll included in The 100 Best Beatles Songs: An Informed Fan's Guide by Stephen J. Spignesi and Michael Lewis. The song is number three in the 100 Best Beatles Songs list, only behind \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"A Day in the Life\", which is number one. == References == ==Other websites== * * * * * * * Category:1970 songs Category:1970s ballads Category:Rock ballads Category:The Beatles songs Category:Bill Withers songs Category:Aretha Franklin songs Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:John Denver songs Category:Joan Baez songs Category:Meat Loaf songs Category:Nick Cave songs",
