 "text": "reconoci.do is an activist group in the Dominican Republic. The group fights discrimination against Dominicans who have ancestors from Haiti. There is a very long history of this kind of discrimination in the Dominican Republic. In the 1930s, the country even massacred people it thought were Haitian. Recently, it has tried to take citizenship away from people it believes are Haitian. reconoci.do holds protests against these actions and helps Dominicans with Haitian ancestors develop positive identities. ==References== Category:Political movements Category:Politics of the Dominican Republic",
