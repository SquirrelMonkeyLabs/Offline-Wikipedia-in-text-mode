 "text": "The Boy Is Mine is an R&B; song by singers Brandy and Monica. It was written by LaShawn Daniels, Fred Jerkins III, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and Brandy Norwood for Norwood's second studio album Never Say Never (1998) but eventually released as the lead single off of both singers' second albums during the second quarter of 1998 (see 1998 in music). Co-produced by Darkchild, Brandy and Dallas Austin, \"The Boy Is Mine\" has become one of the most successful R&B; singles of all time. The song's lyrics tell a story about two women disputing the love of a man and were inspired by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson's 1982 duet \"The Girl Is Mine.\" The song was number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for 13 weeks in a row. It finished as the second-best performing song of 1998 on that chart. ==References== Category:1998 songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number one songs Category:Brandy Norwood songs Category:Monica (singer) songs",
