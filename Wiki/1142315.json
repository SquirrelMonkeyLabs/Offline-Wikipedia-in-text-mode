They saw it in both forests that had never been cut down and in forests that had been cut down and are growing back. They saw it near streams. Scientists saw them between 400 and 1700 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected, for example Santiago Comaina Reserved Zone and the Alto Mayo Protection Forest. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the female frog carries the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. But people cut down the forests where it lives to make farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
