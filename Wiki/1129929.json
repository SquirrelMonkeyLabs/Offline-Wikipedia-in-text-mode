 "text": "Lu (, 249 BC) was a state during the Zhou dynasty in ancient China. It was located around what is now Shandong. It was founded in the 11th century BC, and its rulers came from a branch of the House of Ji (), which ruled the Zhou dynasty. The first duke was Boqin, a son of the Duke of Zhou, who was the brother of King Wu of Zhou and acted as regent for King Cheng of Zhou. Lu was the home of the famous Chinese philosophers, Confucius and Mozi, giving it a strong cultural influence among the states of the Eastern Zhou period and in history. The Annals of Spring and Autumn, for example, was written using the years of Lu's rulers. Another important work of Chinese history, the Zuo Zhuan or Commentary of Zuo, was also written in Lu by Zuo Qiuming. == Name == The American linguist, William H. Baxter (cited in Matisoff, 1995) suggests a possible link between the name Lǔ () and its very similar-sounding word lǔ (), meaning \"salty\" or \"rock salt.\" This is because the area of the State of Lu was a salt marsh in ancient times.Matisoff, James A. (1995). “Sino-Tibetan Palatal Suffixes Revisited”. In: Nishi, Y., Matisoff, J. A. and Nagano, Y. (editors), Senri Ethnological Studies. 41: p. 52, n. 40 of 35–91. ==Area== The capital of the state was in Qufu, and its land mainly covered the central and southwest parts of what is now Shandong Province of China. Lu was bordered to the north by the strong state of Qi and to the south by the powerful state of Chu. Lu's location on the eastern edges of the Western Zhou state, facing non- Zhou people in states like Lai and Xu, was an important reason for its creation. ==History== Lu was one of the many states founded in eastern China at the start of the Zhou dynasty to extend Zhou rule far from its capital, Zongzhou, and its main region, Guanzhong. During the Western Zhou period, Lu helped keep Zhou control steady in what is now Shandong. In the early Spring and Autumn period, Lu was one of the strongest states and competed with Qi to the north. Under Duke Yin and Duke Huan of Lu, Lu defeated both Qi and Song states several times and led missions against other smaller states. However, things changed in the middle of this period when Qi became more powerful. Although Lu managed to defeat Qi in the Battle of Changshao in 684 BC, Lu could not gain the upper hand again. Meanwhile, the power of Lu's dukes weakened due to the rise of strong noble families known as the Three Huan—Jisun, Mengsun, and Shusun—descendants of Duke Huan of Lu. These families were so powerful that when Duke Zhao of Lu tried to regain control, they exiled him, and he never returned. It wasn't until the rule of Duke Mu of Lu, in the early Warring States period, that the dukes regained their power. In 249 BC, King Kaolie of Chu invaded and took over Lu. Duke Qing, the last ruler of Lu, became a commoner. The main line of the Duke of Zhou's descendants came from his firstborn son's third son, Yu, whose descendants took the surname Dongye. The Duke of Zhou’s descendants were given the title Wujing Boshi (). Mencius, the famous Confucian philosopher, was a descendant of Qingfu, one of Duke Huan of Lu’s sons. This family connection is shown in the Mencius family tree.《三遷志》，（清）孟衍泰續修《孟子世家譜》，（清）孟廣均主編，1824年《孟子與孟氏家族》，孟祥居編，2005年 ==Rulers== Here is a list of Lu rulers based on the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian: Title Given name Reign Relationship Duke Tai Boqin c. 1042–997 BC son of Duke of Zhou Duke Kao You 998–995 BC son of Boqin Duke Yang Xi or Yi 994–989 BC brother of Duke Kao Duke You Zai or Yu 988–975 BC son of Duke Yang Duke Wei Fei 974–925 BC brother of Duke You Duke Li Zhuo or Di 924–888 BC son of Duke Wei Duke Xian Ju 887–856 BC brother of Duke Li Duke Shen Bi or Zhi 855–826 BC son of Duke Xian Duke Wu Ao 825–816 BC brother of Duke Shen Duke Yi Xi 815–807 BC son of Duke Wu none Boyu 806–796 BC nephew of Duke Yi Duke Xiao Cheng 795–769 BC brother of Duke Yi Duke Hui Fuhuang or Fusheng 768–723 BC son of Duke Xiao Duke Yin Xigu 722–712 BC son of Duke Hui Duke Huan Yun or Gui 711–694 BC brother of Duke Yin Duke Zhuang Tong 693–662 BC son of Duke Huan Ziban Ban 662 BC son of Duke Zhuang Duke Min Qi 661–660 BC son of Duke Zhuang Duke Xi Shen 659–627 BC son of Duke Zhuang Duke Wen I Xing 626–609 BC son of Duke Xi Duke Xuan Tui or Wo 608–591 BC son of Duke Wen I Duke Cheng Heigong 590–573 BC son of Duke Xuan Duke Xiang Wu 572–542 BC son of Duke Cheng Ziye Ye 542 BC son of Duke Xiang Duke Zhao Chou 541–510 BC son of Duke Xiang Duke Ding Song 509–495 BC brother of Duke Zhao Duke Ai Jiang 494–467 BC son of Duke Ding Duke Dao Ning 466–429 BC son of Duke Ai Duke Yuan Jia 428–408 BC son of Duke Dao Duke Mu Xian 407–377 BC son of Duke Yuan Duke Gong Fen 376–353 BC son of Duke Mu Duke Kang Tun 352–344 BC son of Duke Gong Duke Jing Yan 343–323 BC son of Duke Kang Duke Ping Shu 322–303 BC son of Duke Jing Duke Wen II Jia 302–278 BC son of Duke Ping Duke Qing Chou 277–249 BC son of Duke Wen II ===Rulers family tree=== ==References== == Other websites == * * Category:History of China Category:3rd-century BC disestablishments Category:Former monarchies",
