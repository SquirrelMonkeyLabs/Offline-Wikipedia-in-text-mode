 "text": "\"Puttin' On the Ritz\" is a popular ballad. It was written by Irving Berlin. He wrote this song in May 1927. It was first published in December 1929. The song lyrics tell people that if they are feeling blue they should go \"where fashion sits\" and \"put on the Ritz.\" \"The Ritz\" most likely refers to the Ritz Tower at 465 Park Avenue, New York City. This is a luxury residential building originally built as an apartment hotel just before this song was written. The original 78rpm was recorded by Leo Reisman & his Orchestra (Lew Conrad vocals) in New York City on January 20, 1930 and released on Victor records catalog number 22306. Several other artists sang and recorded the song later in 1930, including Fred Astaire who recorded it on March 26, 1930. In the early 1980s, Taco released a synthpop euro disco-style version of \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" in 1981 by RCA Records and Peer Studios. His performance consisted of song and tap. It hit #4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. lyrics if you're blue, and you don't know where to go to Why don't you go where fashion sits? Puttin' on the Ritz Different types who wear a day coat Pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits Puttin' on the Ritz Dressed up like a million-dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper) Come, let's mix where Rockefellers Walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts Puttin' on the Ritz Have you seen the well-to-do Up and down Park Avenue? On that famous thoroughfare With their noses in the air High hats and Arrow collars White spats and lots of dollars Spending every dime for a wonderful time If you're blue, and you don't know where to go to Why don't you go where fashion sits? Puttin' on the Ritz Different types who wear a day coat Pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits Puttin' on the Ritz Dressed up like a million- dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper) Come, let's mix where Rockefellers Walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts Puttin' on the Ritz Dressed up like a million-dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper) If you're blue, and you don't know where to go to Why don't you go where fashion sits?
