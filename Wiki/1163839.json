 "text": "Allobates hodli is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests. Scientists saw the frog between 90 and 220 meters above sea level. The frog lives in many protected parks, for example Parque Nacional Mapinguari. ==Young== People see young frogs near streams. Scientists saw one group of tadpoles on the ground near a dead leaf. ==Danger== Scientists say that this frog is not in danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms, to make places to raise animals, and to build dams for electricity. Sometimes people go into the Parque Nacional Mapinguari to dig for good rocks and metal, even though this is against the law. ==Other frogs== Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Allobates femoralis, but now they think they are two different frogs that sometimes live in the same places. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
