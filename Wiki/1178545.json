 "text": "The golden rocket frog or Beebe's rocket frog (Anomaloglossus beebei) is a frog. It lives in Guyana. ==Home== These frogs only live on large bromeliad plants that grow on the ground and on smaller bromeliad plants that grow on trees. This frog can live in forests or on savannah grasslands. Scientists saw the frog on Kaieteur Plateau, on the eastern edge of the Pakaraima Mountains, and on Mount Wokomung and Mount Ayanganna, between 450 and 1600 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog inside Kaieteur National Park. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on leaves. She usually lays four eggs at a time and the tadpoles swim in the water inside the bromeliad plants. Tadpoles eat dead things, insect young, unfertilized eggs, and other tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Different kinds of forests are growing where the frog lived. Dead leaves fall off new trees, and these leaves cover the phytotelms, so the frog does not have good places to have young. Human beings also dig for gold and diamonds where the frog lived. Scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could have killed many of these frogs. Scientists found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Anomaloglossus. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
