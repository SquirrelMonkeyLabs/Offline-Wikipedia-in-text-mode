 "text": "The Civil Rights Act of 1968 () is a landmark law in the United States signed into law by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during the King assassination riots. The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and did not allow discrimination on race, sex, or religion concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing. Since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children. Pregnant women are also protected from illegal discrimination because they have been given familial status with their unborn child being the other family member. Title X, commonly known as the Anti-Riot Act, makes it a felony to carry on a riot. The initial vote in the House of Representatives was 327–93 (161–25 in the House Republican Conference and 166–67 in the House Democratic Caucus) with 12 members voting present or abstaining, while in the Senate the final vote with amendments was 71–20 (29–3 in the Senate Republican Conference and 42–17 in the Senate Democratic Caucus) with 5 members voting present or abstaining. ==References== Category:1968 in the United States Category:United States federal legislation",
