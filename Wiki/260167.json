This earned Reed the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2004. One of his touchdowns was a record 106 yards after he intercepted a pass. That was an NFL record until Reed broke his own record in 2008 with a 107 yard interception return for a touchdown. In 2010, Reed intercepted nine passes even though he missed six games because of an injury. In his career (not counting postseason), Reed managed 547 tackles (455 alone), six sacks, a safety (A sack in the end zone. The team that makes the sack is awarded two points and the opposing drive stops.), 11 forced fumbles, a Ravens record 57 interceptions, and 12 career touchdowns. Reed has become a critical component on a feared Baltimore defense.

Reed won Super Bowl XLVII with the Ravens when they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31. On May 7, 2015, Reed signed a one-day contract with the Ravens and retired from playing professional football. ==Personal== Reed started the Eye of the Hurricane Foundation, which helps recovery efforts in Reed's home state of Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina badly damaged the region in 2005. ==References== ==Other websites== *Ed Reed at NFL.com Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Baltimore Ravens players Category:Houston Texans players Category:New York Jets players Category:American football safeties Category:Sportspeople from Louisiana",
