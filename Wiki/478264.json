 "text": "Psychological trauma is damage to the psyche that happens after a stressful event. It can be caused by things that make a person afraid. Common causes include humiliation, sexual abuse, bullying, psychological abuse and domestic violence. Living with any of those for a long time can cause psychological trauma. People who have suffered psychological trauma, particularly in childhood and adolescence, are more likely to have psychological problems. Those problems can include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality disorder. ==References== Category:Psychology",
