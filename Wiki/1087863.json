 "text": "Each Australian state has a governor, who serves as the head of state and represents the King or Queen. Governors perform the same actions as the federal Governor-General but on the state level. The Governor of a state acts on the advice of that state's Premier and the state cabinet. The Australian Indian Ocean Territories (Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands), Norfolk Island and the Northern Territory have administrators instead of governors. The Australian Capital Territory does not have a governor or an administrator. ==Current state and territory governors== ===Current state governors=== Name Portrait Title Term Margaret Beazley Governor of New South Wales 2 May 2019 (4 years, 280 days) Barbara Baker Governor of Tasmania 16 June 2021 (2 years, 235 days) Frances Adamson Governor of South Australia 7 October 2021 (2 years, 122 days) Jeannette Young Governor of Queensland 1 November 2021 (2 years, 97) Chris Dawson Governor of Western Australia 15 July 2022 (1 year, 206 days) Margaret Gardner Governor of Victoria 9 August 2023 (181 days) ===Current administrators of the territories=== Name Portrait Region Term Title Hugh Heggie Northern Territory 2 February 2023 (1 year, 4 days) Administrator of the Northern Territory George Plant Norfolk Island 1 June 2023 (250 days) Administrator of Norfolk Island Farzian Zainal Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands 19 June 2023 (232 days) Administrator of Australian Indian Ocean Territories ==References== Category:Monarchy in Australia Category:Parliaments of the Australian states and territories Category:Viceroys in Australia",
