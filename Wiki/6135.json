 "text": "No is an English word which has a negative meaning. It is the opposite of the word Yes, which is a positive term. No is used when someone is turning away something. It is used when opposing an idea, as well. It can also be used in different figures of speech. In both sentences and talking, the words \"No\" and the word \"Not\" can both be used, though the word \"No\" is mainly used when speaking to other people. In some cases, however, \"Not\" is not acceptable, and vice versa. These words are not to be confused with the similar sounding words know and knot. Examples of proper usage of \"No\" and \"Not\": *Is this green? _No_ , it is _not_. *There is _no_ way round the back. * This is _not_ the way (but there is another way). * I will _not_ come. * Oh, _no_! * _No_ , thank you. * _Not_ on my watch! * I can _not_ go anywhere. Examples of improper usage of \"No\" and \"Not\": * That is _no_ the way you do it. * Oh _not!_ * I _know_ how to tie a _knot._ (Disambiguation) * I didn't _no_ that! * I can _no_ go. * _No_ t way!
