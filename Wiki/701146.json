 "text": "Heinrich Reichert (1949 - June 13, 2019) was a Swiss developmental and neurobiologist. He worked at the Biozentrum University of Basel. Reichert investigated the role of neural stem cells in the development of the brain using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model. He discovered a molecular production program followed by stem cells as they develop in the brain. From 1986 to 1991 he was a faculty member at the University of Geneva before returning to the University of Basel. Reichert remained as a professor at the Zoological Institute until 2006, when he moved to the Biozentrum of the University of Basel where he continued to teach and research. Reichert died on June 13, 2019 in Basel, Switzerland at the age of 69. ==References== ==Other websites== *Research group Heinrich Reichert *Biozentrum University of Basel *University of Basel Category:1949 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Swiss biologists Category:Scientists from Basel Category:Academics of the University of Geneva Category:Academics of the University of Basel",
