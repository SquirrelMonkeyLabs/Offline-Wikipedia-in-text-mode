 "text": "Speciesism is thinking that humans are better than animals, though humans are technically also animals. It is also treating animals worse than humans. For example, humans often kill animals to eat. Humans rarely kill and eat other humans. The word speciesism was first used in 1970 by Richard D. Ryder, an English philosopher, in a pamphlet called Speciesism. It was made popular by Peter Singer's 1975 book Animal Liberation. In the book the name of the fifth chapter was \"Man's Dominion ... a short history of speciesism\". The word 'speciesism' was first put in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1985. ==Media== In 2013, a documentary movie about speciesism called Speciesism: The Movie was released.
