 "text": "Millennials (also known as Generation Y) are typically defined as the generation of people born from 1981 to 1996. The United States Library of Congress, the U.S. Census, and the federal government of Canada (Statistics Canada) have officially cited the 1981-1996 birth range for Millennials as of 2022. These federal agencies state that 1996 is the last birth year of the Millennials. Some sources define Millennials as those born between 1980 to 1994, with a few researchers and demographers having 2001 as late as the ending birth year. People in this generation are sometimes called Echo Boomers because of the high birth rate during this period. The high birth rate almost exceeds that of the Baby Boom period after World War II. ==References== Category:Cultural anthropology Category:Generations",
