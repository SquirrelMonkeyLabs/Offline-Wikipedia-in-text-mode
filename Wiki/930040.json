 "text": "I Did That! are stickers, usually showing President Joe Biden, pointing at the price of gasoline at the fuel pumps in a gas station around the United States. The stickers began appearing in 2021 and have increased in popularity as the price of gasoline and other goods have risen due to inflation. The stickers are sold online by dozens of vendors and one retailer, with one place having $40,000 in sticker sales in August of 2021. The stickers are a form of vandalism with owners and employees at gas stations complaining the stickers make some customers angry and are hard to remove. Many believe that it is not Biden's fault for the inflation price as many blame it on the COVID-19 pandemic. Some also argue that Biden's $1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan caused the rise in inflation in the US. ==References== Category:Joe Biden",
