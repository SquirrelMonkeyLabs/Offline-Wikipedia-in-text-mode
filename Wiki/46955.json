There are about 450 Air Cadet squadrons, located in every province and territory in Canada. The two other cadet programs for youth in Canada are the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and the Royal Canadian Army Cadets. People between the ages of 12 and 18 inclusive can join this program for free, and they are led by the officers of the Canadian Forces Cadet Instructor Cadre. ==Aims and Motto== The aim of the Air Cadets is to \"develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness; and to stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land and air activities of the Canadian Armed Forces\".
