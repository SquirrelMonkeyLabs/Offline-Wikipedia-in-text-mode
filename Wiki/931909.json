Learning the reasons why certain things happened often saves us from making the same mistakes again”. == Personal life and posterity == Dr. Sze married to Bessie Li (), a pianist in 1934 and he is survived by a daughter, Diane Wei (); a son, architect Chia-ming Sze (); two sisters, Julia Sze-Bailey, and Alice Wang; five grandchildren, and fourteen great-grandchildren.
