 "text": "Congregationalism is a way to organize Christian (usually Protestant) churches. With Congregationalism, each church or community has a lot of autonomy. Anabaptist, Baptist, and Pentecostal movements are often organised this way. It is different from Presbyteranism, where a number of elders govern the churches, and from Episcopalism, where a number of bishops govern the churches. Originally, Congregationalism was part of the Anglican church, who took some of the teachings of Jean Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli, in the 16th and 17th century. Those who wanted congregationalism usually were Puritans. Category:Christian movements and denominational families",
