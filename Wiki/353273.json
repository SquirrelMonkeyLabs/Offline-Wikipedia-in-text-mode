 "text": "\"Adam and Steve\" is a phrase that was created from a conservative Christian slogan \"God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve\". It was created to summarize Christian bible-based arguments against homosexual practices or homosexuality.Clarke, Victoria (September–October 2001). \"What about the children? arguments against lesbian and gay parenting\", Women's Studies International Forums 24 (5): 555–570. The slogan also expresses that heterosexuality is the natural way of life for humanity. The phrase appeared on a protest sign as early as 1977. It was mentioned in a New York Times report about a November 19 rally in Houston, Texas that year. In 1979, Jerry Falwell helped the phrase to become popular. This happened after a press conference he held for Christianity Today.David L. Balch, Homosexuality, Science, and the \"plain Sense\" of Scripture, (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000) p22 Many LGBT people have made movies and plays based on the phrase. Paul Rudnick wrote the play The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told, which has a gay couple named Adam and Steve.Hurwitt, Robert (May 21, 2001). \"Adam and Steve's adventures in paradise\", San Francisco Chronicle, p. E4. In 2005, a gay movie was released with the title Adam & Steve. ==References== ==Books== * Katha Pollitt, Adam and Steve — Together at Last, The Nation, 15 December 2003. Category:Homophobia",
