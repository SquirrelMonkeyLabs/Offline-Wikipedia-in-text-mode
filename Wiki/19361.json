 "text": "The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British 1957 movie from Columbia Pictures, based on Pierre Boulle's 1952 book The Bridge over the River Kwai (). The movie was mainly filmed in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and also in England. In 1941 the Japanese Army invaded Thailand. They built a railway to link Bangkok to Rangoon. Thousands of Asian workers and POWs (prisoners of war) died while working on the project. Part of this project was building bridges over Thailand's Kwai Yai, at a place named Tamarkan, which is near a town named Kanchanaburi. The deaths of the Asian workers and the prisoners were real events, but most of the book and the movie are not true. The British soldiers were slaves; they did not help the Japanese. Two bridges were built; one was made of wood, one was made of concrete and steel. Both bridges stood for two years and were destroyed by bombers in 1945. In the movie the bridge is destroyed by commandos. A real train rode over the bridge as it blew up. (This can be compared to a scene in the 1927 movie, The General, which starred Buster Keaton.) The movie is best known for the \"Colonel Bogey March\", the song that is whistled by the POWs. It is also known as the \"River Kwai March\". The movie won 7 Academy Awards, one for Best Picture. It also won the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay. == Other websites == * Account of bombing crew * Category:1957 war movies Category:1957 adventure movies Category:1957 drama movies Category:Best Picture Oscar Category:British drama movies Category:British war movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies directed by David Lean Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:World War II Category:Multilingual movies",
