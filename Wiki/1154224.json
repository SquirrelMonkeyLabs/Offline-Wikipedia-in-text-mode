As he marched, he demanded money from the people and mistreated them in many ways. According to Ghulam Husain, those who paid him or gave him expensive gifts were spared, while those who resisted were killed and their homes were looted. Ahmad Khan Qureshi, the grandson of Daud Khan Qureshi (who founded the town of Daudnagar in Gaya district), tried to defend the nearby Ghauspur fort. However, Balajiâ€™s soldiers besieged the fort and forced him to pay a ransom of 50,000 rupees to save his life. The town of Daudnagar was also looted. The people of Patna became very worried about their safety, and some even sent their families to Hajipur on the other side of the Ganges River. However, Balaji did not go to Patna. He marched through Tikari, Gaya, Manpur, Bihar, and Monghyr, reaching Bhagalpur, where his soldiers treated the people badly. Many residents of Bhagalpur fled to the other side of the Ganges. One brave woman, the widow of Ghaus Khan (a general who had died in battle), could not leave with her family, so she decided to protect her home and honor. Impressed by her courage, Balaji spared her property and even sent a group of his soldiers to guard her house until his army had left the area. == References == Category:Maratha Empire",
