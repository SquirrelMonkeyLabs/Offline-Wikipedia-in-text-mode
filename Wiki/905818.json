 "text": "The Yucat√°n shovel-headed tree frog, Yucatan casque-headed tree frog, or Yucatan casquehead tree frog (Triprion petasatus) is a frog that lives in Mexico and Guatemala. Scientists also saw it just once in Honduras. ==Name== This frog's Latin petasatus means \"with a hat on.\" The Latin and English names come from the frog's big head, which looks like a hat or helmet. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 48.1 to 60.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 65.0 to 75.2 mm long. It is named after its large, bony head, which looks like a hat or helmet. The adult male frog is olive green. The adult female frog is light brown or green-brown. There are dark brown or black marks on the back and legs. Some frogs have silver marks on their backs and head. The frogs have yellow color on their sides or red brown on their back legs. The belly is white and tan. ==Actions== This frog lays eggs when the weather is rainy. The male frog climbs to a branch about 2.5 meters over the ground and sings for the female. The male and female mate in trees or other high places. The female lays eggs in shallow water. When the weather is dry or the sun is hot, this frog goes to a hole in a tree. It puts its body inside and its head against the hole. ==Threats== This frog is not in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Human beings cut down the forests for wood, farms, towns, and places for animals to eat grass. ==Relationship to humans== Human beings catch and breed this frog to sell as pets. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
