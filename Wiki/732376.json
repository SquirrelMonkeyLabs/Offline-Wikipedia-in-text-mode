 "text": "The Hollow Earth theory proposed that Earth is entirely or partially hollow. Edmond Halley first suggested the theory in the late 17th century. By around 1774, Charles Hutton had proven the theory false in his Schiehallion experiment. Still, the theory was occasionally defended through the mid-19th century, notably by John Cleves Symmes Jr. and Jeremiah N. Reynolds. However, by that time, it was part of popular pseudoscience and no longer a scientifically viable hypothesis. The concept of a hollow Earth still recurs in folklore and as the premise for subterranean fiction, and a subgenre of adventure fiction (Journey to the Center of the Earth, At the Earth's Core). Hollow Earth is also used in Godzilla vs. Kong as a major plot point. == References == Category:Pseudoscience",
