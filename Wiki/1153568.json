 "text": "The Chevrolet BrightDrop is an electric delivery van manufactured by General Motors (GM). It is part of GM`s BrightDrop brand, This vehicle was unveiled in January 2021 and has been in production since December 2022. ==History== The idea for the Chevrolet BrightDrop began in 2020 when GM started developing an all-electric delivery van known as \"BV1.\" Initially, GM planned to build the van at its Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly facility. In January 2021, GM introduced the BrightDrop EV600 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. This vehicle was intended for commercial use and was part of GM's plan to meet the logistics needs of companies like FedEx, which placed an order for 500 units. The EV410, a smaller version, was shown later that year and was targeted at companies like Verizon, which was the first to order it. Production for the Zevo 600 began in December 2022 at GM's CAMI Automotive plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. CAMI is capable of producing up to 50,000 units annually. The smaller Zevo 400 was set to start production in late 2023. Several companies, including FedEx, Verizon, and Merchants Fleet, placed large orders for the BrightDrop vans. The fleet management company Merchants Fleet made a significant order of 18,000 units in 2021. Other companies, like Walmart and Hertz, also secured large orders. The BrightDrop Zevo series underwent name changes in 2022, with the EV600 and EV410 being rebranded as Zevo 600 and Zevo 400. By 2025, the BrightDrop brand was phased out, and the vehicle was renamed the Chevrolet BrightDrop. ==Markets and Customers== The Chevrolet BrightDrop was initially designed for commercial fleets, targeting companies in the logistics and delivery sector.
