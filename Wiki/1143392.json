 "text": "A nuncio is a special type of diplomat from the Holy See (the central government of Vatican City and Catholic Church). He represents the Pope and works like an ambassador. Nuncios are usually sent to countries or international organizations to help build relationships and support the Catholic Church in that area. The place they work is called an apostolic nunciature, similar to an embassy. Nuncios are usually appointed by the Pope, and they are often archbishops. A nuncio helps communicate between the Pope and the local Catholic leaders, and he often helps in choosing new bishops for the country where he is stationed. Nuncios are equal to the rank of ambassador. == Related pages == * Archbishop ad personam * Titular bishop == References == Category:Titles",
