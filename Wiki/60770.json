 "text": "Windows Server 2008 is an unsupported (by now, except for Azure customers) server operating system from Microsoft, the previous version of which was Windows Server 2003. This operating system was codenamed named Windows Server \"Longhorn\", but on May 15, 2007, Bill Gates announced its official name on Windows Hardware Engineering Conference 2007. This operating system has several new features compared to its previous version. Many of these new features are present in Windows Vista. Windows Server 2008 removed support for processors without ACPI. It is the first version of Windows Server that includes Hyper-V and is also the final version of Windows Server that supports x86-based processors (also know as IA-32-based or 32-bit processors). Its successor, Windows Server 2008 R2 requires a 64-bit processor in any supported architecture (x86-64 for x86 and Itanium). ==References== ==Other websites== ===Microsoft=== * *Microsoft TechCenter for Windows Server 2008 *New Networking Features in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista â€“ lengthy article from Microsoft Technet covering new networking features in detail *Changes in Functionality from Windows Server 2003 with SP1 to Windows Server 2008 *Windows Server 2008 Technical Overview ===Others=== *Screenshots of Server Components from Latest Longhorn Builds *ZDnet UK article *News.com *computerperformance.co.uk *winsupersite.com Preview *winsupersite.com Preview 2 Category:Microsoft operating systems Category:Windows Server",
