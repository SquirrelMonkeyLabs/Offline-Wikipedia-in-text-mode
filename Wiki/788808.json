 "text": "On March 23, 2020, Daniel Prude was fatally injured after being physically restrained by Rochester, New York police officers. Prude had been suffering from a mental health episode after taking PCP and was running naked in the city's streets. The officers put a spit hood over his head after he began spitting. They held him face down on the pavement for two minutes and fifteen seconds, and he stopped breathing. Prude received CPR on the scene and later died of problems caused from asphyxia after being taken off life support. The autopsy report ruled Prude's death a homicide. The killing first received attention in September 2020 when the police body camera video and written reports were released along with the autopsy report. Following the report's release, protesters were outside the Rochester police headquarters. Many of the protests have been peaceful. Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, said Prude's death is being investigated. Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo said on September 2, 2020 that he had originally asked James to investigate the case in July. ==References== Category:2020 in the United States Category:2020s in New York (state) Category:March 2020 events Category:Police misconduct in the United States Category:Rochester, New York Category:Deaths by person in the United States",
