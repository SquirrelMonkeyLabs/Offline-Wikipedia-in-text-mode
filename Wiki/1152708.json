The car is known for having a variety of flex-fuel engines, which allow it to run on different types of fuel, such as ethanol and gasoline. The HB20 was first sold outside Brazil in 2016, starting with Paraguay and Uruguay, and later in Mexico and Colombia in 2022. The name \"HB20\" stands for \"Hyundai Brasil\" and the number \"20\" is used to indicate the car's size category, similar to the Hyundai i20. == First Generation (HB; 2012-2019) == The first generation of the Hyundai HB20 was produced from 2012 to 2019. It offered two engine options: a 1.0-litre and a 1.6-litre. The higher trim models were equipped with a 1.6-litre Gamma engine, which produced 128 horsepower. The HB20 was available with both automatic and manual transmissions for the 1.6-litre engine, while the 1.0-litre version only had a manual transmission. By 2013, over 75% of the parts used in the HB20 were produced in Brazil. ===HB20s=== The Hyundai HB20S is the sedan version of the HB20 hatchback.
