 "text": "A Christmas tree is a tradition associated with the celebration of Christmas. It is usually an evergreen coniferous tree that is cut and brought into the home. In Europe, the tree is traditionally a Norway spruce tree. The tree is decorated with Christmas lights and colourful ornaments during the days around Christmas. An angel or a star is often placed at the top of the tree. Fir trees outside the home may be decorated in a similar fashion. The custom of the Christmas tree has its origin among the Protestant peoples of Northern Europe. It is not a religious symbol. == In minority communities == There Is an annual Christmas tree lighting party in the courtyard of the YMCA in Gaza City () in the Gaza Strip. ==Jingle Bells == == References == == Other websites == * British Royal Family Christmas trees Category:Christmas Category:Decorations",
