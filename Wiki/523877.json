Checklist of birds of the Afrotropical and Malagasy regions. Tauraco Press. It is one of three living species of peafowl, the other two being the Indian peafowl (originally of India and Sri Lanka) and the green peafowl (native to Burma and Indochina). The Congo peacock has physical characteristics of both the peafowl and the guineafowl, which may indicate that the Congo peacock is a link between the two families. == References == Category:Phasianidae Category:Birds of Africa",
