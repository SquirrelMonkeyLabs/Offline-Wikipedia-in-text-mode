Even though it was very strong, caused a lot of damage and many deaths, it was not the strongest, costliest, or deadliest of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, that would be Hurricane Mitch later on. Hurricane Georges crossed some islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba, before it made landfall in Mississippi. Georges killed 604 people and caused $5.9 billion in damage, much of it from high winds and severe flooding.
