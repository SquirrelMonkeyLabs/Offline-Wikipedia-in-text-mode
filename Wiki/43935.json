 "text": "Cryolophosaurus is a theropod dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic period. It is the only theropod to be found in Antarctica. Cryolophosaurus was discovered in the Jurassic Hanson Formation in the Transantarctic Mountains. The find of this dinosaur was significant because it proves that the dinosaurs lived on all continents and that high latitude climates were tolerated by dinosaurs at that time. Cryolophosaurus is also significant because it is the oldest known tetanuran from any continent: it is the only one from the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus had a large crest on the top of the skull, above the eyes. It extends upwards from the skull. Cryolophosaurus was found about from the South Pole but then it was about or so farther north.Hammer W.R. & Hickerson W.J. 1999. Gondwana dinosaurs from the Jurassic of Antarctica.

In Currie P.J. & Padian K. Encyclopedia of dinosaurs. Academic Press. Also found were the remains of Glacialisaurus (a large basal sauropodomorph), a crow-sized pterosaur, synapsids, and another unknown theropod.Hammer W.R. & Hickerson W.J. 1994. A crested Theropod dinosaur from Antarctica. Science 264 (5160): 828–830. There are also the remains of many plant genera around the same age as fossils of Cryolophosaurus, proving that dense plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward. == References == Category:Tetanurans",
