 "text": "Nico Ditch is a long earthwork in Greater Manchester, England. It's about six miles (9.7 km) in length and runs between Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford. People made this earthwork between the 5th and 11th century. They might have built it as a defense or to show where one area ends and another begins. Some parts of the ditch are still there today, where it stretches for about 330 yards (300 m), in Denton Golf Course. In places where it's still visible, the ditch is 4 to 5 yards (3.7 to 4.6 m) wide and up to 5 feet (1.5 m) deep. The government has given protection to a part of this earthwork because it's very old and important. They call it a Scheduled Ancient Monument. == References == Category:History of Manchester",
