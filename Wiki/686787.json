 "text": "Microsoft Store (previously Windows Store) is an app store for Microsoft Windows, Windows Server and Xbox OS. It was first made for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 to make adding new programs easier for the users. When Windows 10 was released, Microsoft put Xbox Store, Windows Marketplace, Xbox Music, Xbox Video, and the Windows phone store all in one program they called Microsoft Store. In 2015, there were more than 670,000 different programs on Microsoft Store. The biggest groups of programs were Games and Entertainment. Before a program is added to the Microsoft Store, it must pass security, content, and compatibility checks. == History == === The Web-based storefront === Microsoft previously maintained a similar digital distribution system for software known as Windows Marketplace, which allowed customers to purchase software online. The marketplace tracked product keys and licenses, allowing users to retrieve their purchases when switching computers. Windows Marketplace was discontinued in November 2008. At this point, Microsoft opened a Web-based storefront called \"Microsoft Store\". === Windows 8 === Microsoft first announced Windows Store, a digital distribution service for Windows at its presentation during the Build developer conference on September 13, 2011. Further details announced during the conference revealed that the store would be able to hold listings for both certified traditional Windows apps, as well as what were called \"Metro-style apps\" at the time: tightly-sandboxed software based on Microsoft design guidelines that are constantly monitored for quality and compliance. For consumers, Windows Store is intended to be the only way to obtain Metro-style apps. While announced alongside the \"Developer Preview\" release of Windows 8, Windows Store itself did not become available until the \"Consumer Preview\", released in February 2012. Updates to apps published on the store after July 1, 2023, won't be available to all Windows 8 RTM users except Windows Embedded 8 Standard users. Per Microsoft lifecycle policies, Windows 8 reached the end of mainstream support on January 9, 2018 and will reach the end of extended support on January 10, 2023. The mainstream support for Windows Embedded 8 Standard ended on July 10, 2018 and will reach the end of extended support on July 11, 2023. === Windows 8.1 === An updated version of Windows Store was introduced in Windows 8.1. Its home page was remodeled to display apps in focused categories (such as popular, recommended, top free and paid, and special offers) with expanded details, while the ability for apps to automatically update was also added. Windows 8.1 Update also introduced other notable presentation changes, including increasing the top app lists to return 1000 apps instead of 100 apps, a \"picks for you\" section, and changing the default sorting for reviews to be by \"most popular\". Updates to apps published on the Store after July 1, 2023, are no longer available to Windows 8.1. Per Microsoft lifecycle policies, Windows 8.1 reached the end of mainstream support on January 9, 2018 and will reach the end of extended support on January 10, 2023. === Windows RT === The installation of apps and games from the Windows Store is the only way to get apps on Windows RT, a mobile version of Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 designed to run on tablets. Normal apps such as Google Chrome, world's most popular web browser can't be installed through any web browser on the Internet for Windows RT, even through Internet Explorer, which is a built in web browser in Windows RT, and also in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 and earlier. === Windows 10 === Windows 10 was released with an updated version of the Windows Store, which merged Microsoft's other distribution platforms (Windows Marketplace, Windows Phone Store, Xbox Video and Xbox Music) into a unified store front for Windows 10 on all platforms, offering apps, games, music, film, TV series, themes, and ebooks. In June 2017, Spotify became available in the Windows Store. In September 2017, Microsoft began to re-brand Windows Store as Microsoft Store, with a new icon carrying the Microsoft logo. Xbox Store was merged into this new version of the platform. This is in line with Microsoft's platform convergence strategy on all Windows 10-based operating systems. Web apps and traditional desktop software can be packaged for distribution on Windows Store. Desktop software distributed through Windows Store are packaged using the App-V system to allow sandboxing. In February 2018, Microsoft announced that Progressive Web Apps would begin to be available in the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft would automatically add selected quality progressive web apps through the Bing crawler or allow developers to submit Progressive Web Apps to the Microsoft Store. Starting from Windows 10 version 1803, fonts can be downloaded and installed from the Microsoft Store. === Windows 11 === In Windows 11, Microsoft Store received an updated user interface, and a new pop-up designed to handle installation links from websites. Microsoft also announced a number of changes to its policies for application submissions to improve flexibility and make the store more \"open\", including supporting \"any kind of app, regardless of app framework and packaging technology\", and the ability for developers to freely use first- or third-party payment platforms (in non-game software only) rather than those provided by Microsoft. === Windows Server === Windows Store is available in Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 but is not installed by default. It's unavailable in Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019. However, UWP apps can be acquired from Microsoft Store for Business (formerly Windows Store for Business) and installed through sideloading. ==Programmer tools== Microsoft Store provides developer (people who write programs) tools for tracking apps in the store. They can track downloads, the money they make, if the program doesn't work, and ratings. ==Most liked apps== These are the most liked apps and games on the Microsoft Store on Mobile and PC.
