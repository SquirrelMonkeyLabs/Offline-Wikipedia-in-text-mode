 "text": "The Army of Mississippi (also called the Confederate Army of the Mississippi) was a Confederate army during the American Civil War. It should not be confused with the Union Army of the Mississippi. It was formed on March 29, 1862. The commander was Full General Albert Sidney Johnston with Full General P. G. T. Beauregard as second-in-command. After Johnston's death at the Battle of Shiloh, Beauregard took over. After that there were a series of commanders. In November 1862, the Army of Mississippi was renamed the Army of Tennessee.Terry L. Jones, Historical Dictionary of the Civil War (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2011), p. 114 The second army called the Army of Mississippi was created in December 1862, under Lieutenant general John C. Pemberton. This army had a confusing number of additional names. The II corps, under Major general Sterling Price was called the \"Army of West Tennessee\".John Eicher; David Eicher, Civil War High Commands (Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001), p. 888 It was also called the Army of the West. When both corps (I corps and II corps) were changed into divisions in January 1863, they dropped the name Army of Mississippi. Leonidas Polk had commanded I corps. In May 1864, Polk's troops joined with Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee to form the third Army of Mississippi. Polk was killed in June 1862 after which the army was simply called Alexander P. Stewart's corps. == Notes == == References == Category:Confederate States of America Category:1862 establishments in the United States",
