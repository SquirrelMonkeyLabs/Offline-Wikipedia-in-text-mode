 "text": "Côte-d'Or (literally, \"Slope of Gold\", \"Golden Slope\") is a department in the eastern France. It is one of the 83 first French departments made during the French revolution and one of the eight departments of the Bourgogne-Franche- Comté region. Its prefecture (capital) is the city of Dijon. The inhabitants of the department are called Costaloriens (women:Costaloriennes) or Côte-d'Oriens (women:Côte d'Oriennes). == History == Côte-d'Or is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was formed from part of the old province of Burgundy. It was divided in seven districts: Arnay-le-Duc, Beaune, Châtillon-sur-Seine, Dijon, Is-sur- Tille, Saint-Jean-de-Losne and Semur-en-Auxois. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the seven districts were changed into four arrondissements: Dijon, Beaune, Châtillon-sur-Seine and Semur-en-Auxois. After the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), the department was occupied by the Austrian army from June 1815 to November 1818. In 1926, the arrondissement of Montbard was made with the arrondissements of Châtillon-sur-Seine and Semur- en-Auxois. ==Origin of name== Côte-d'Or is the only French department who was not named after a geographical feature: a river, a mountain, and so on. The name was chosen by Charles-André-Rémy Arnoult, member of the National Constituent Assembly of 1789, who suggested the name, inspired by the golden hue that took the vineyards of the region in the autumn. The French word côte means, in this case, a slope that geologists usually name with the Spanish word cuesta. ==Geography== Côte-d'Or is part of the region of Bourgogne- Franche-Comté. The department borders with 7 departments that are part of 2 regions: * Grand Est region ** Aube (north) ** Haute-Marne (northeast) * Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region ** Haute-Saône (east) ** Jura (southeast) ** Saône-et-Loire (south) ** Nièvre (southwest) ** Yonne (west) The department has an area of . The highest point of the department is Mont de Gien (), high; it is in the commune Ménessaire.

A chain of hills called the Plateau de Langres runs from north-east to south-west through the department to the north of Dijon and continues south-westwards as the Côte d'Or escarpment, which takes its name from that of the department (without the hyphen). It is the south-east facing slope of this escarpment which is the site of the celebrated Burgundy vineyards. To the south-east of the plateau and escarpment, the department lies in the broad valley of the middle section of the river Saône. ===Rivers=== The main rivers of Côte-d'Or are: * The Seine, with its source in the southern end of the Plateau de Langres, in the commune Source-Seine. ** The Aube, right tributary of the Seine. ** The Armançon and the Serein, tributaries of the Yonne which is a left tributary of the Seine. * The Saône, an important tributary of the Rhône.
