 "text": "Quantum foam (or space time foam) is a concept in quantum mechanics. It was created by John Wheeler in 1955. The foam is supposed to be thought of as the foundation of the things that make up the universe. The theory predicts that very small particles of matter and antimatter are constantly created and destroyed. These subatomic objects are called virtual particles. ==References== Category:Quantum mechanics",
