It carried reenactments. It also included footage of real emergencies. It was never intended as a teaching tool. However some viewers used the knowledge they got watching the show. There were two specials: 100 Lives Saved and 200 Lives Saved. They were dedicated to viewers who wrote CBS with their stories about watching Rescue 911. The show carried two episodes on Hurricane Hugo. It also had episodes on the 1986 New Year's Eve fire in Puerto Rico. It covered a June 1990 tornado and a 1987 Amtrak train wreck. A reboot of Rescue 911 was scheduled for late 2019. ==References== Category:American reality television series Category:1989 American television series debuts Category:1980s American television series Category:1990s American television series Category:1996 American television series endings Category:CBS network shows",
