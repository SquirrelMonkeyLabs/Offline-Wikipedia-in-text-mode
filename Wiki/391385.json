These genera are unusual in the family Rosaceae because they all have the nitrogen-fixing bacteria called Frankia in their roots.Swensen, S.M.; Mullin, B.C. (1997). The impact of molecular systematics on hypotheses for the evolution of root nodule symbioses and implications for expanding symbioses to new host plant genera. Plant and Soil. 194: 185–192. Dryadoideae plants are subshrubs, shrubs, or small trees. Their fruits are either an achene or an aggregate of achenes. ==Notes== Category:Rosaceae",
