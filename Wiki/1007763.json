 "text": "The Diet of Augsburg were the meetings of the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire that held in the German city of Augsburg. Both an imperial city and the residence of the Augsburg prince-bishops, the city hosted the Estates in many such sessions from the 10th century. The most famous one was in 1530, when Emperor Charles V summoned the German princes to a diet in Augsburg to put an end to ecclesiastic dissensions. Each prince was asked to state in writing in German and in Latin his religious opinions and the ecclesiastic abuses that should be corrected. Category:1530 Category:Holy Roman Empire",
