 "text": "Peter Kent Navarro (born July 15, 1949) is an American economist and author who has been the Senior Counselor to the President since 2025. He works in the Trump administration as the Assistant to the President, Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, and the national Defense Production Act policy coordinator. He was a Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the White House National Trade Council, a newly created job in the executive branch of the U.S. government. He is also a professor emeritus of economics and public policy at the Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, and the author of Death by China. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Donald Trump refused to concede, Navarro advanced conspiracy theories of election fraud and in February 2022 was subpoenaed twice by Congress. One subpoena required him to produce documents to the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack; the other subpoena required him to give testimony to the committee. Navarro refused to comply, effectively ignoring both subpoenas, and was referred to the Justice Department. On June 2, 2022, a grand jury indicted him on two counts of contempt of Congress. On September 7, 2023, he was convicted on both counts, and on January 25, 2024, he was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $9,500. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:American economists Category:American political writers Category:University of California faculty Category:Politicians from Massachusetts Category:Writers from Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
