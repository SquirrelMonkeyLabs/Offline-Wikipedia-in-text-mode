 "text": "Ramsey is a city in Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. James Beatty and Thomas A. Holmes were the first people to settle in Ramsey, establishing the Old Log Trading Post there in 1849. The village of Itasca was subsequently platted in 1852. The hamlet was home to the Northern Pacific Railroad station and Anoka County's first post office. Following the expulsion of the local Winnebago Indians, the Itasca Village was abandoned. The first township, Watertown, was established in 1857. It would subsequently become Dover and then Ramsey. With 8,000 or so residents, Ramsey was formed on November 12, 1976. Category:Cities in Minnesota",
