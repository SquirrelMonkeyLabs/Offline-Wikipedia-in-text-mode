 "text": "The dull-green shrub frog (Pseudophilautus sordidus) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. People have seen it between 1555 and 1830 meters above sea level. The adult frog is about 26.1â€“36.5 mm long from nose to rear end. Adult male frogs have small things on their faces, heads, sides, and back that look like horns. This frog can be brown or light green in color, with different patterns: Some have yellow lines on their backs or bellies, and some do not. Some have black marks on their backs or blue on their sides, and some do not. Most of these frogs have white spots on their bellies. For a time, scientists thought this frog was extinct; they thought all the frogs were dead. But some scientists found a Pseudophiluatus viridis frog again in 2023. They looked at its genetic molecule from the part of the cell that makes energy to make sure it was P. viridis and not a different frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
