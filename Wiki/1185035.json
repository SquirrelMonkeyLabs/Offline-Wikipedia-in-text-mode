 "text": "The Battle of Rohtas took place during the summer of 1764 between the Sikh Confederacy and the Durrani Empire. It ended in a decisive Sikh victory, resulting in the capture of the strategic Rohtas Fort and the imprisonment of the Afghan commander Sarbuland Khan. ==Background== In early 1764, the Sikhs captured Lahore, defeating Khwaja Ubaid Khan. The governor, Kabuli Mall, submitted to the Sikhs, agreed to a large tribute, and allowed Hari Singh Bhangiâ€™s vakil, Tek Chand, to reside in the city with a fixed salary. Subsequently, the territory east of the Chenab River came under Sikh control, while Charat Singh and the Bhangi Misl extended their authority west of the Chenab, up to Multan, by mid-1764. Their forces advanced into the Chaj Doab, encountering and defeating scattered Afghan resistance before pushing past the Jhelum River towards Rohtas. ==Battle== Sarbuland Khan, an uncle of Ahmad Shah Durrani, led a force of around 12,000 men. He attempted to hold Rohtas Fort against the advancing Sikh forces but was repulsed and forced to retreat within the fortress. Charat Singh then feigned a withdrawal, lifting the siege temporarily. Believing the Sikhs had retreated, Sarbuland Khan emerged from the fort with his troops in pursuit. The Sikh forces turned and rapidly stormed the now-vulnerable Rohtas Fort, killing many defenders, looting baggage, and capturing Sarbuland Khan. ==Aftermath== Impressed by his treatment in Sikh captivity, Sarbuland Khan offered his services to Charat Singh, requesting to remain as governor. However, his proposal was declined. Instead, he paid 200,000 rupees for his release and was allowed to return to his homeland. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * *",
