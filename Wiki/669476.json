 "text": "Tsukuyomi (), or Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto (), is the god of the moon in Japanese mythology. He is the brother of Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, and of Susanoo, the god of the sea and storms. He killed Toyoukebime, the goddess of food. His sister Amaterasu was upset and said that she would stay away from him forever. That is why the sun is up during the day and the moon is up during night. Both the Kojiki (c. 712 CE) and the Nihon Shoki (720 CE) agree in their description of Amaterasu as the daughter of the god Izanagi and as the elder sister of the moon goddess, Tsukuyomi, and of the storms and seas god, Susanoo. == References; == Category:Gods and goddesses of Japan Category:Gods and goddesses of the moon Category:Shinto Category:National personifications Category:National symbols of Japan",
