 "text": "The Nationalist Movement Party (sometimes called Nationalist Action Party; Turkish: Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, MHP) is a political party in Turkey. The MHP was founded on 9 February 1969 by Alparslan Türkeş. Their most successful performance in an election was in 1999, where they received 5,606,634 votes and won 129 out of 550 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. In the last election, they received 5,599,600 votes and won 40 out of 550 seats. The Nationalist Movement Party has been called a neo-fascist party, and has been linked to some violent militias. They are cultural nationalists, and moved from supporting secularism to having a pro-Islamic stance. They are Eurosceptics, meaning they are against the European Union. Their slogan is: Ülkenin Geleceğine Oy Ver (meaning \"Vote for the country's future\"). The MHP refuses to have any form of dialogue with the left-wing Kurdish nationalist Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). == References == == Other websites == *Official Web site *Official Site of Ulku Ocaklari (Turan idealists) *Nationalist Movement Party Multimedya Category:Political parties in Turkey Category:Conservative parties Category:Fascism",
