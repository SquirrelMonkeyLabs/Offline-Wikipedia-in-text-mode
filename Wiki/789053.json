Natella created the site in 2008, but it was not until October 2009 that it gained attention from the press and online internet users. This Man's became an internet meme that spoofed flyers of the website, references in movies and television shows like The X-Files, and a manga series based on the hoax by Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine. ==References== Category:Internet memes Category:Unfinished movies",
