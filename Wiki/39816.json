 "text": "Otaku is a Japanese slang word, deriving from the honorific \"お宅\" (otaku), meaning \"your house\". It has come to mean someone who obsessively exerts time, money, and energy into a hobby. Otaku have a deep, complex knowledge around a particular subject or area of study It is oftentimes (esp. in the West) used to refer to avid consumers of anime and manga. The term can also be compared with Hikikomori. In Japan, otaku is generally regarded as an offensive word, due to the negative cultural perception of withdrawal from society. However, the otaku philosophy of living has gained traction among Japanese youth and adolescents, likely as a reaction to the established culture of intense work and academic studies. Under 30’s have developed a neo-otaku identity with more positive associations of being a geek or nerd. In the West, the word usually describes an anime or manga \"fanatic\". It is not typically seen as derogatory. ==References== Category:Slang Category:Anime and manga terms",
