 "text": "Marseille has a complex public transport system. A network of motorways connects Marseille to the north and west (A7), Aix-en-Provence in the north (A51), Toulon (A50) and the French Riviera (A8) to the east. Marseille-Saint- Charles is the main railway station. It opened in 1848. All the tracks have overhead electric power cables. There is a TGV service to Paris which takes about 3 1/2 hours. There are also TGV services to Madrid, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Lille, and regional and local services. There is a small harbour station at La Joliette. The Marseille Metro is a rapid transit system, started in 1977. It has two lines, partly underground, serving 31 stations. There are also three tramway lines, with 32 stations. The RTM (Régie des Transports Métropolitains) operates the bus network in Marseille, providing extensive coverage across the city and surrounding areas. With more than 80 bus lines, RTM buses connect major neighborhoods, metro stations, and key landmarks, offering reliable service throughout the day. A bicycle sharing system named \"Le vélo\" was started in 2007. There are plans for developing multi-modal transport in the region. == References == Marseille Category:Marseille",
