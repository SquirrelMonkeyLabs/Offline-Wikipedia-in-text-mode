 "text": "The cancer exodus hypothesis says that groups of cancer cells (CTC clusters) stay together as they travel and spread in the body. Scientists used to think these groups had to break up into single cells to spread, but now they think the groups can stay together. The hypothesis says that groups of cancer cells (CTC clusters) enter the bloodstream, move through it together, and then leave the bloodstream at new places without breaking apart. This helps them spread more easily. This idea is an important step in understanding how cancer spreads and the role of CTC clusters in this process. ==References== Category:Biology Category:Medicine",
