 "text": "A Boolean data type is a data type that can be either one of these two values: true or false. It was originally added to the C++ language by the ISO/ANSI(International Standards Organization/American National Standards Organization) committee in 1998. The expressions are named after the English mathematician George Boole, who formulated rules for mathematical logic. Boolean expressions also end up with a value of either true or false. Boolean expressions are used in branching and looping statements. In programming, a boolean can be used with conditional statements (statements that only happen when the right condition is met). ==Examples== An example of a boolean in pseudocode: if (Boolean_Expression) { Yes_Statement_1 ... Yes_Statement_Last } else { No_Statement_1 ... No_Statement_Last } Boolean data types can also be used with other booleans inside of conditional statements using a conjunction operator. For example: if (Boolean_Expression1 and Boolean_Expression2) { Yes_Statement_First ... Yes_Statement_Last } else { No_Statement_First ... No_Statement_Last } It can also be used with a disjunction operator: if (Boolean_Expression1 or Boolean_Expression2) { Yes_Statement_First ... Yes_Statement_Last } Category:Computer science Category:Boolean algebra",
