 "text": "Machine translation, sometimes referred to by the acronym MT, is part of computational linguistics. It is the use of computer software to translate text or speech from one natural language to another. At its basic level, MT changes words words in one natural language for words in another. That is literal translation. Present machine translation software adapts the translation to the subject. For example, weather reports improve output by limiting the substitutions. This technique is very effective in domains where specialised formal language is used. It follows then that machine translation of government and legal documents more often produces usable output than conversation or less standardised text. == Quotes == In the words of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT): == History == The origins of machine translation can be traced back to the work of Al-Kindi, a ninth- century Arabic cryptographer. He developed techniques for systemic language translation. He was aware of cryptanalysis, frequency analysis, probability and statistics, which are all used in modern machine translation. An idea related to machine translation appeared in the 17th century. In 1629, René Descartes proposed a universal language, where equivalent ideas shared a symbol. The idea of using digital computers for translation of natural languages was proposed in 1947 by England's A.D. Booth and Warren Weaver at Rockefeller Foundation in the same year. \"The memorandum written by Warren Weaver in 1949 is perhaps the single most influential publication in the earliest days of machine translation\". Others followed. One example was reading and composing Braille texts by computer. == Related pages== * Translation * Literal translation == References == == References == # == Other websites == * International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT) * Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA) * European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) * Asia-Pacific Association for Machine Translation (APAMT) * Association for Computational Linguistics * Machine Translation, an introductory guide to MT by D.J.Arnold et al.
