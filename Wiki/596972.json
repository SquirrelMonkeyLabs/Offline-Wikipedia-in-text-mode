 "text": "Green florescent protein (GFP) is a protein that is found in moon jellyfish. It helps scientists look at cell molecules. There is another substance the is called RFP that serves the same purpose but is red, and is found in coral. For GFP scientists have learned that if you take away one molecule it can change the whole color of the substance, along with if you add a molecule to the original substance it will also change the color. Scientists have made the colors cyan (ECFP) and pink (mRaspberry). The GFP is a florescent substance that is kind of like a highlighter. Category:Proteins",
