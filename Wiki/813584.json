In the case of groups of musicians, they may have agreed on a few basic rules beforehand. Generally, improvisation requires a few skills: * The person improvising must be able to play the instrument fairly well. * The person must know some basic rules or parameters on the kind of music played * The person must be creative Musical composition is different: With composition, people first write down and arrange the music, before playing it, with improvisation they play right away.
