It happened during the years of 541 to 542 in the Byzantine Empire while under the rule of Justinian I. Historians estimate that this pandemic killed as many as 100 million people across the world, partly because it returned every twelve years until 770, when it stopped for about 500 years. Between 541 and 700, the Plague of Justinian killed about half of the people in Europe.An Empire's Epidemic It also may have contributed to the success of the Muslim conquests.Justinian's Flea Its social and cultural impact is comparable to that of the Black Death. == Origin and impact == Through trade, the plague came from India to Ethiopia or Egypt. Eventually, trade ships brought the plague north to the large city of Constantinople. Ships bringing grain, which Constantinople imported, carried rats along with them. These rats carried the plague. By the end of the pandemic, the plague had killed 40% of Constantinople's population. At its worst, it killed 10,000 people in Constantinople every day. Doctors at the time relied on religious and folk remedies which were not effective in treating the plague. This caused the plague to spread rapidly throughout Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. In total, about 25 million people died because of the Plague of Justinian. It is said to have contributed to the fall of the Byzantine Empire, because it killed farmers and caused famine. Also, the empire relied on tax money, and the plague killed many taxpayers.Overall, the Plague of Justinian was a sickness that happened around 1,500 years ago. It started in the city of Constantinople and spread to other parts of the world. Many people got sick and some even died. The disease was caused by bacteria and was spread by fleas on rats. It lasted for several years and caused a lot of damage to the Byzantine Empire by weakening its defenses, harming its economy, and killing large amounts of its population. Even though it was a long time ago, we can still learn from this event and take precautions to prevent the spread of diseases today. == References == == Sources == * Edward Walford, translator, The Ecclesiastical History of Evagrius: A History of the Church from AD 431 to AD 594, 1846.
