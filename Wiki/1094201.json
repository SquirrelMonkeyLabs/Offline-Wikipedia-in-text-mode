 "text": "Al-Kawthar is the 108th and shortest chapter of the Quran. It has only 3 verses: # Lo! We have given thee Abundance;Marmaduke Pickthall # So pray unto thy Lord, and sacrifice. # Lo! it is thy insulter (and not thou) who is without posterity. There is debate over when the Surah was revealed earlier or later in Muhammad's life. Ibn Ishaq believes that the Surah was before the Isra and Miraj in Mecca. == References== == Other websites == * Quran 108 Clear Quran translation Category:Chapters in the Quran",
