 "text": "The Lick Observatory is an astronomical observatory. It is owned and operated by the University of California. It is on Mount Hamilton, in the Diablo Range just east of San Jose, California, USA. The observatory is managed by the University of California Observatories. Its headquarters is on the campus of University of California, Santa Cruz. ==Significant discoveries== The following astronomical objects were discovered at Lick Observatory: *Several moons of Jupiter **Amalthea **Ananke **Elara **Himalia **Lysithea **Sinope (disputed) *Near-Earth asteroid (29075) 1950 DA *Several extrasolar planets **Quintuple planet system ***55 Cancri **Triple planet system ***Upsilon Andromedae (with Whipple Observatory) **Double planet systems ***HD 38529 (with Keck Observatory) ***HD 12661 (with Keck) ***Gliese 876 (with Keck) ***47 Ursae Majoris == Issues == Due to its proximity to San Jose, light pollution and skyglow are an issue for the observatory. This was fine in the past, as San Jose used sodium ion bulbs, whose light were easy to filter out. However, due to safety concerns, LED lights which cannot be filtered out have been installed in San Jose. San Jose dims its lights when the observatory is active. ==References== * * Vasilevskis, S. and Osterbrock, D. E.
