 "text": "The Governer General of Canada serves as the representative of the Canadian monarch, currently King Charles III, within Canada. While the King is the country’s head of state, he resides primarily in the United Kingdom due to his responsibilities as monarch of multiple Commonwealth realms. The Governor General is appointed by the King on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada. As the King’s representative, the Governor General performs various ceremonial and constitutional duties, including granting Royal Assent to legislation, appointing the Prime Minister, and summoning or dissolving Parliament. Although the Governor General technically possesses significant constitutional powers, these are exercised almost exclusively on the advice of the Prime Minister or Cabinet, in accordance with Canada’s system of responsible government. For example, the Governor General appoints Senators, federal judges, and other officials based on recommendations from the Prime Minister. In rare circumstances, the Prime Minister may seek the King’s direct involvement, such as when appointing additional Senators under Section 26 of the Constitution Act, 1867.
