 "text": "Darwinsaurus (meaning \"Darwin's lizard\") was an ornithopod dinosaur. It was once wrongly described as Iguanodon. In the early nineteenth century dinosaur skeletons were discovered near Hastings in East Sussex. These were first reported by Richard Owen in 1842. In 1889 they were referred to Iguanodon fittoni by Richard Lydekker.Lydekker, R., 1889, \"Notes on new and other dinosaurian remains\", Geological Magazine, 6: 352-356 They were then assigned to Hypselospinus fittoni by David B. Norman in 2010. In 2012 Gregory S. Paul named them as a separate genus and species. The type species is Darwinsaurus evolutionis. The generic name honours Charles Darwin for his theory of evolution. The first fossil described as Darwinsaurus is known from a partial skeleton. Paul's decision is being challenged,David B. Norman 2013.
