 "text": "The Joseph R. Biden Jr. Presidential Library is an archive of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in which state papers related to the presidency of Joe Biden have been kept after his term as President of the United States ended. There is a proposed presidential center in the works as well. The University of Delaware in Wilmington, Delaware, and Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, were both initially seen by Biden as possible locations for his library. Following Biden's pardon of his son Hunter Biden, several major Democratic Party donors reportedly planned on stopping their donations for the proposed library facility. ==References== Category:Joe Biden Category:Presidential libraries",
