 "text": "St Mawes is a small town opposite Falmouth, on the Roseland Peninsula on the south coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom. It lies on the east bank of the Carrick Roads into which the River Fal flows. The town is in the civil parish of St Just in Roseland. It was once a busy fishing port, but the trade declined during the 20th century. The town of St Mawes is a popular tourist location. There is a ferry service to Falmouth, which is less than a mile away by boat, but about 30 miles away by road. The town takes its name from the Celtic saint Maudez (Mawe), who may have come from Ireland.Doble, G. H. (1964) The Saints of Cornwall: part 3.
