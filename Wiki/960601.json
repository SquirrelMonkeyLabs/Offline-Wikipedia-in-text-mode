 "text": "Labour Zionism is a political ideology that supports Socialism and Zionism at the same time and believes to have one you need the other. It's associated with the kibbutz movement in Israel which was based on communalism. Labour Zionism was supported by Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and by his successors Moshe Sharett, Levi Eshkol, Yigal Allon, Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. The first Prime Minister of Israel who wasn't a Labour Zionist was Menachem Begin, the creator of the Likud. Benjamin Netanyahu was known for opposing Labour Zionism when he worked for Ariel Sharon and trying to end Israel's socialism. ==Related pages== * Antisemitism * The Holocaust * History of Jews * Revisionist Zionism Category:Israel Category:Zionism Category:Jewish history Category:History of Israel Category:History of the Middle East",
