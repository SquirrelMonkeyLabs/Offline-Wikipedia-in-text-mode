 "text": "Vic Rattlehead is the mascot of American thrash metal band Megadeth. Vic is a skeleton wearing a suit, with his eyes, ears, and mouth covered by clamps and metal pieces. Vic is a symbol of censorship, as well as the phrase \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\". == Appearances == Vic was on the cover art for Megadeth's first four albums: Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!, Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?, So Far, So Good... So What!, and Rust in Peace. Vic did not appear on any other album covers until 2001, when he was on The World Needs a Hero. He then appeared on the covers for The System Has Failed, United Abominations, Th1rt3en, Dystopia, and The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!. Vic has made small appearances in a few Megadeth music videos. == References == Category:Mascots Category:Megadeth",
