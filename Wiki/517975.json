 "text": "Polish People's Republic was an official name of Poland from 1952 until 1989, when it was a Soviet satellite state. It was on the Stalinist model, ruled by the Polish United Workers' Party. As with most Communist governments, the Polish government tolerated religious beliefs, but in 1950, Minister for Religious Affairs, Antoni Bida accused the Polish Church of hostility to the state. Conflict began and continued right up the collapse of the People's Republic of Poland, and with it communism in Poland, in 1989. In June 1956, there was a workers strike, which was put down violently. 75 people were killed. On October 19, 1956 arrived leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. There was a political breakthrough and new Communists became the leaders. Year 1980 was one of heavier years in history of country. A lot of protests led to the creation of \"Solidarność\" independent labor union, which later led to the fall of communism in Poland in 1989. ==References== Category:1940s establishments in Poland Category:1947 establishments in Europe Category:1989 disestablishments in Europe Category:Former socialist republics Category:Former dictatorships",
