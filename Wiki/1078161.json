It was released on January 12, 2024. The song is Grande's first solo release in over three years, although she was featured on remixes of The Weeknd's \"Save Your Tears\" (2021) and \"Die for You\" (2023), both of which topped the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Yes, And?\" was compared to Madonna's \"Vogue\" (1990). Grande wrote and produced the song with Max Martin and Ilya Salmanzadeh. The song is about overcoming rumors and gossip. It arrived after media stories of Grande's relationship with her costar of the Wicked musical, Ethan Slater, and Slater's divorce. The video for the song is a tribute to singer Paula Abdul's music video for the song \"Cold Hearted\" (1989), featuring similar outfits and a similar scene of a meeting in a rehearsal hall. On January 22, 2024, it was reported that the song entered at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking Grande's eighth US number-one hit. It was also her sixth number-one debut, tying Taylor Swift for the most number-one entrances by women. == Track listing == == Charts == Chart performance for \"Yes, And?\" Chart (2024) Peak position Global 200 Excluding U.S. (Billboard) 1 Bulgaria 22 Germany (Media Control) 8 Ireland (IRMA) 5 UK Singles (OCC) 2 == References == Category:House songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Ariana Grande songs Category:2024 songs",
