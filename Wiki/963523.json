The Free Army lost 3,000 men from joining Al- Nusra Front since the Free Syrian Army had little to no ammunition. A Western diplomat suggested that Al-Nusra Front would be cleaner, stronger and better, \"fighters are moving from one group to another\". During May 2013, Salim Idris, the Leader of the Free Syrian Army said \"the rebels were badly fragmented and lacked the military skill needed to topple the government of President Bashar al-Assad.\" And also that he was working on a \"countrywide command structure\". But the lack of Ammunition and supplies, low money and terrible logistics stopped him from doing so. He said \"Now it is very important for them to be unified.

All Free Syrian Army people [there] have joined the Islamic State.\" He said this after the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Turkish Land Forces finished training the Free Syrian Army.

The Turkish Land Forces attacked Northern Syria to stop the advance of the Kurds and stop \"Terrorists\" and establish a \"Safe Zone\" According to Erdogan. Turkey would aid the Free Syrian Army, and then would later make their own version of the Free Syrian Army named the \"Turkish-Backed Free Syrian Army\" or simply the Syrian National Army, serving as the main military unit of the opposition with better funding. ===Rise of the Syrian National Army=== In 2017,the Syrian National Army was formed, the group was named the \"Turkish-Backed Syrian Free Army\".

And also funded by the with weapons U.S made such as the BGM-71 TOW and Mk-19s. ==Foreign aid== The Free Syrian Army has received aid from nations such as the United States and Qatar, each nation has a different purpose of supporting the Free Army, some nations have cut their funding to the Free Syrian Army, and stopped contact with the Free Army. ===Support from the Gulf States=== As soon as the Syrian Civil War started, the Gulf States (Saudia Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait) funded the Free Syrian Army and other opposition groups, so they can overthrow the Assad regime and stop Iran from influencing Saudia Arabia, and other Gulf States. The United States told the Gulf States to stop funding as the funded Islamist Jihad groups like Al-Nusra Front and such. ===Aid from Turkey=== Turkey has funded the Free Syrian Army since 2011, they allowed defected officers to live in Turkey. And gave them weapons, gear and such. And when Turkey joined the Syrian Civil War officially in 2016, and in 2017, they made the \"Turkish-Backed Free Syrian Army\" or the Syrian National Army. And funded the group with weapons, vehicles, tanks and such. ===American Support=== In 2014 under the Obama Administration, the United States's operation was code-named \"Train and Equip Programme\" and selected certain Syrian Opposition groups, the Free Syrian Army was one of the groups, and sent over $500,000,000 to the Free Syrian Army, and the CIA trained the Free Syrian Army and other groups. 157 troops were trained by the CIA. The group was named Division 30, and was apart of the Free Syrian Army. It later joined the Al-Nusra Front after being stopped attempting to cross the border to Turkey. And they handed all of their weapons and some of their men to be able to pass the border. ==Tactics and methods== During October of 2011, the Free Syrian Army had no armored vehicles, so they would use Hit-and-Run tactics against Shabiha (Pro-Assad thugs) and the Syrian Arab Armed Forces. They would plant bombs and fire at enemy buses and lightly armored Vehicles. The main tactics were generally guerrilla warfare. But they would use it only if they want to slowly take over a piece of land, during late 2011 the Free Syrian Army took over most of Syria. The Free Syrian Army would use hit and run tactics to slowly push off the Syrian Armed Forces from certain places, and use IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) to stop or slow down Syrian Army convoys. Street battles happened in some towns that could have lasted for days. During massive attacks from Pro-Syrian Government forces, they would attack command and control centers and logistic companies or platoons. And sabotage would be used and small ambushes behind enemy lines that destrtoyed vehicles and such. All of the communications of the Free Syrian Army was or is done by using a Walkie-Talkie, and Intelligence would be gathered by talking to locals and soldiers that are about to defect. And they would work also with Civilian councils and Human Rights groups that are observing a certain location or place. It would usually happen next to large population places such as Homs, Aleppo and Damascus. ==Structure== The Free Syrian Army has or had multiple units in it's history. Since 29th July, 2011, multiple units were a part of the Free Syrian Army such as Jaish al-Izzah and other groups. ===First Units=== When the group was first formed, there were only four units, these included: *Hamza al-Khatib Battalion, a battalion named after Hamza al- Khatib, a 13 year old who was tortured and killed by the Syrian Army. *Freedom Battalion *Saladin Battalion *Al-Qashash Battalion ===Other groups=== *1st Coastal Division, one of the first operators of the BGM-72 TOW. *101st Infantry Division, also one of the first to operate the TOW. *Fastaqim Union, An Islamist faction. *Hamza Division, Trained and armed by the United States and Turkey. *Jaysh al-Izzah *Jaysh al-Nasr *Jaish al-Tahrir * al-Mu'tasim Brigade. *Euphrates Jarabulus Brigades, part of the SDF. *Army of Revolutionaries, part of the SDF. **Jabhat al-Akrad, was expelled from the FSA. **Seljuk Brigade **Northern Sun Battalion *Northern Democratic Brigade, also a part of the Syrian Democratic Forces. *Revolutionary Commando Army *Forces of Martyr Ahmad al-Abdo *Alwiya al-Furqan ===Former groups=== *1st Infantry Brigade *16th Division *Hazzm Movement, one of the first users of the BGM TOW. *Army of Mujahideen, former Sunni Islamist alliance group. *Liwa Ahrar Souriya, later joined the Syrian National Army. *Free Idlib Army, later joined the Syrian National Army. **Northern Division **13th Division **Mountain Hawks Brigade *Levant Front, also joined the SNA. **Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki (disbanded) **Authenticity and Development Front **Northern Storm Brigade *Victory Brigades *al-Rahman Legion *Southern Front **Revolutionary Army, not to be confused with the Revolutionary Commandos. *Army of Free Tribes *Southern Army ==Notes== ==References== Category:Organizations based in Syria",
