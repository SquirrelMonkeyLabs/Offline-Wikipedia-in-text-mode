 "text": "Lawrence is a city in Douglas County in the state of Kansas in the United States. It is in the northeastern part of the state, near Kansas City. It is the county seat of Douglas County. In 2020, 94,934 people lived there. This makes it the sixth-biggest city in Kansas. The University of Kansas and Haskell Indian Nations University are in Lawrence. The New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) created Lawrence in 1854. It is named after Amos Adams Lawrence, who gave financial support to the city. During Bleeding Kansas, Lawrence was where the Wakarusa War (1855) and the Sack of Lawrence (1856) happened. Lawrence is also the site of the Lawrence Massacre (1863) which happened during the American Civil War (1861–1865). Lawrence started as an important place for free-state politics. After that, Lawrence's economy grew to be in many industries. These industries include agriculture, manufacturing, and education. Lawrence is called a \"college town\" because the University of Kansas is an important part of the city. There are many places in town where students like to go. == History == === Early history === Before the creation of the Kansas Territory, the area was part of the Shawnee Reservation. The Shawnee reservation was created in 1830. Most of eastern Kansas was in the reservation. In 1854, it became part of the Kansas Territory. The Oregon Trail went through the area. People on the Oregon Trail used a hill called \"Hogback Ridge\" to help guide them.Andreas (1883), pp. 30809. Today, Hogback Ridge is called \"Mount Oread.\" In the first half of the 1800s, there were many arguments about slavery in the United States. During this time, every time a free state (a state where slavery was illegal) was added into the country, a slave state (a state where slavery was allowed) had to be added too. The Missouri Compromise continued to let this happen. As a compromise between people arguing for or against slavery being legal in new states, Senator Lewis Cass and Senator Stephen A. Douglas promoted the idea of \"popular sovereignty.\" That meant the people in the area would decide to have slavery or not (instead of politicians in Washington deciding). Popular sovereignty was a big part of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act. That law undid the Missouri Compromise in practice. The Kansas-Nebraska Act also created the Kansas Territory and the Nebraska Territory.Gilman (1914), pp. 510. After the law passed, anti-slavery people were worried that the Kansas Territory would become a slave state.Cordley (1895), p. 1. This is because the state next to Kansas is Missouri, which was a slave state. People believed that the first settlers in Kansas would be from Missouri. To stop Missouri from influencing Kansas, anti-slavery people from around the United States came to Kansas. These people wanted to make Kansas a free state.Childers (2011), pp. 48–70.Cordley (1895), pp. 12. These people were called \"free-staters.\" The New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) helped anti-slavery people move to Kansas. It sent two men named Charles L. Robinson and Charles H. Branscomb to explore the land. They would decide a good place to send people. They saw Hogback Ridge, and they liked it because it was close to the Oregon Trail.Cordley (1895), pp. 45.Andreas (1883), pp. 31214.Federal Highway Administration (2002), p. A64.Andreas (1883), p. 308. They told the NEEAC to send people to this place. While Robinson and Branscomb were exploring, the NEEAC was getting people to move to Kansas. The NEEAC wanted to send a big group of people to claim the land. However, a cholera outbreak in the Missouri Valley stopped this from happening.Andreas (1883), p. 312. The NEEAC was able to get a small group of only 29 men to go. They left Boston, Massachusetts on July 17, 1854. Many people in Boston were happy to see them do this, and they hoped they would do well.Connelly (1918), p. 360. In late July, the group came to St. Louis and met Charles Robinson. He gave them transportation and told them what to do. They came to the Kansas Territory in late July. They ate their first meal on Hogback Ridge on August 1, 1854.Armitage and Lee (1992), p. 5. After they had eaten, half of them left to claim the land around them. The other half stayed on Hogback Ridge. They began putting up their tents between Mount Oread and the Kansas River (close to where Massachusetts Street is). This was the start of the city.Connelly (1918), p. 361. Four weeks later, Robinson and Samuel C. Pomeroy led a second group of 67 people from Worcester, Massachusetts on August 31. While they were going to Kansas, other anti- slavery people joined them. When they came to Lawrence on September 911, their group had 114 people.Cordley (1895), pp. 67. This group had about ten women, some children, and some musicians. A third group came on October 8-9. However, many of them \"became disgusted\" by the settlement because it did not look good, and they went back to New England. Many felt the NEEAC tricked them. A fourth group came on October 30,Andreas (1883), pp. 31416.Andreas (1883), pp. 31617. a fifth group on November 20, and a sixth group on December 1.Gilmore (2005), p. 47. On September 18, 1854, the people of Lawrence made a government. On September 20, they wrote a constitution which did not allow slavery. The people of Lawrence wrote this constitution even though other people near them wanted slavery. On September 30, the people of Lawrence came together to protect Thomas J. Ferril, an anti-slavery clergyman from Missouri. Pro-slavery people went to Ferril's house and threatened violence. The pro- slavery people left when they saw free-state people coming with guns. On October 1, a woman destroyed the tent of a free-state man. Pro-slavery people came to stop the settlers from building the tent again, but they built the tent again without violence. Lawrence was first called \"Wakarusa\". It also had different names like \"New Boston\" or \"Yankee Town.\" Some people wanted the city to be called \"Lawrence\" to honor a man named Amos Adams Lawrence. He was a Republican businessman who did not like slavery. People believed that if they named the city \"Lawrence,\" he would give financial support to the city. He did.Bisel (2012), p. 32. On October 1, the people voted to name the city Lawrence. On October 17, people started building houses and businesses. Pro- slavery people tried to build houses close to Lawrence, and people from Lawrence hated this. They had a very angry argument. The pro-slavery people threatened violence, but they left. No violence happened. In early October 1854, Andrew Horatio Reeder, the first governor of the Kansas Territory, came to Lawrence. He had a party. He asked everyone to get along. He did not say anything about slavery. The first winter in Lawrence was difficult because it was very cold, and people did not have good houses. Two miles south of Lawrence on November 3, 1854, the first elections were held. At the elections, a man named Henry Davis attacked a pro-slavery man named Lucius Kibbee using a Bowie knife. Kibbee then shot Davis and killed him. This was the first murder in Kansas. Two newspapers were started in 1854. They were the Kansas Pioneer and the Herald of Freedom. The writers of the newspapers wrote about their belief that slavery was wrong. The Plymouth Congregational Church was built in September 1854; it was the first church in Kansas. In January 1855, Lawrence's first post office was built. The first postmaster was E. D. Ladd.Cordley (1895), p. 20. On January 10, 1855, Lawrence's first free school was built. The teacher was Edward Fitch. Kansas State Board of Agriculture (1878), pp. 187-191. === \"Bleeding Kansas\" === At the start of 1855, the free-staters and the pro-slavery people around Lawrence started fighting for political power. At the Kansas elections on March 30, 1855, about 700-1,000 pro-slavery people from Missouri voted at the election. They came in more than 100 wagons. They had guns, rifles, pistols, and Bowie knives. They also brought two pieces of artillery.Cordley (1895), p. 3031. No one argued with them because there were a lot of them. They went back to Missouri the next day. Before the election, the government did a census which showed that 8,601 people lived in Kansas. Of those 2,905 were voters; Lawrence had 369 voters.Cordley (1895), p. 28. There were a total of 2,905 voters in the territory, but there were 6,307 votes counted. 1,034 votes were cast in Lawrence, but 802 were from people who did not live in Kansas. Only 232 of the votes were real.Cordley (1895), p. 32. At the election, a man named Silas Bond was shot at, and he ran away. He was shot at because he was \"an obnoxious free-state man.\" On August 27, 1855, the pro- slavery people were happy when the Governor Daniel Woodson chose a pro-slavery man, Samuel J. Jones, to be the county sheriff. In October 1855, the anti- slavery man John Brown came to Kansas. He brought many guns to give to other anti-slavery people. In June 1855, the people of Lawrence had a meeting and decided to resist any laws the Kansas legislature passed. They believed the legislature was elected by armed Missouri people, not Kansas people. Amos Lawrence and others sent crates full of rifles. They wrote on the crates that the things inside were books because \"the border ruffians had no use for books,\" so they did not take the rifles when they came to Lawrence.Cordley (1895), p. 37. Horace Greeley helped send a howitzer to Lawrence. On November 21, 1855, the pro-slavery man Franklin N. Coleman shot anti-slavery man Charles Dow in the head. This killed him. This happened after many angry arguments between them about land claims.Litteer (1987), pp. 47.Connelley (2018) [1900], p. 44. When Sheriff Samuel Jones investigated the crime, Franklin Coleman said he shot Charles Dow in self-defense. Jones believed Coleman because they both were pro-slavery men. Jones decided to arrest Jacob Branson, a friend of Charles Dow and an anti-slavery man, for disturbing the peace. A group of anti-slavery people saved Branson.Bisel (2012), pp. 5556. ====Sacking of Lawrence==== Wilson Shannon, the governor of the Kansas Territory, saw that the people were becoming very angry and violent. He asked the Kansas militia to come and keep the peace. Shannon wanted the people in the militia to be from Kansas, but Samuel Jones brought 1,200-1,500 men from Missouri.Litteer (1987), pp. 1314. When the people of Lawrence learned this, they made a militia of 600-800 men. They chose Robinson to lead the militia. James H. Lane was chosen as his second-in-command. John Brown and his four sons also joined to fight. Both groups were ready to fight, but they could not because the winter was very cold. Wilson Shannon decided to prevent a fight. He demanded that the leaders of both sides agree to a peace treaty. They did, and the men from Missouri went back to Missouri.Fitzgerald (1988), pp. 7475. This \"war\" is known as the Wakarusa War. In spring 1856, pro-slavery people wanted to make the free-staters weak. The pro-slavery people said that the Herald of Freedom newspaper, the Kansas Free State newspaper, and the Eldridge Hotel were very bad. On April 23, 1856, Samuel Jones came to Lawrence. He tried to arrest some anti-slavery people who had created their own anti- slavery government. A sniper shot Samuel Jones, but he did not die. The people of Lawrence made Jones leave.Connelley (2018) [1900], p. 53. On May 11, Federal Marshall (like a police officer but for the entire country) Israel B. Donaldson said that people interfered with Samuel Jones which was not legal.Ball (2001), p. 174. A Kansas grand jury agreed. They said that Lawrence built the Free State Hotel (the Eldridge Hotel) for military purposes.Griffin (1968), pp. 40926. Donaldson, Jones, and others recruited an army of 800 menBall (2001), p. 175.Monaghan (1984), pp. 5558. to enforce the law. However, they also wanted to stop the anti-slavery men in Lawrence.Whitfield (2014), p. 14. On May 21, Donaldson and Jones took their army to Lawrence. They arrested more anti-slavery people. The people of Lawrence hoped that Donaldson and Jones would leave after the arrests, but this did not happen. Jones and his men started sacking Lawrence. They took over Charles Robinson's house and used it as a headquarters. They attacked free-state newspapers offices. They struck the printing presses, and they threw the sort into the Kansas River. They shot the Free State Hotel (the Eldridge Hotel) using a cannon and burned it down. They took $30,000 worth of things. After burning Charles Robinson's house, the army left. The day of destruction was called the \"Sacking of Lawrence.\" Surprisingly, only one person died; a man died when he was hit by falling masonry. In late September 1856, another sack seemed like it was about to happen when 2,700 pro-slavery men came to Lawrence. Anti-slavery men defended the city. Governor John W. Geary saw what was happening. He asked for federal reinforcements to defend the city. No violence happened. Kansas State Board of Agriculture 1878 Biennial Report. ====Anti-slavery capital==== In 1855 and 1857, Lawrence got a charter (a document that officially creates a town) from the pro-slavery Kansas government. The people of Lawrence resisted the Kansas government because they believed they were too pro-slavery. They did not accept it because it would force Lawrence to follow pro-slavery laws.Chisholm (1911). In July 1857, the people of Lawrence tried to get an \"official\" (only the people of Lawrence saw it as official) charter from the extralegal (having no real authority) anti-slavery government. If they could not get one, Lawrence would simply make one themselves. Governor Robert J. Walker believed this was a revolt. On July 15, 1857, he sent an army to Lawrence and declared martial law. The army stayed close to Lawrence until October 1857. They stayed until October because there were elections.United States Congress (1922), p. 71. They wanted to make sure that there would be no violence at the elections. Anti-slavery people won the elections. The Kansas government became controlled by anti-slavery people. In early 1858, Samuel Jones quit his job, and he left Kansas.Adams (1896), p. 276. On January 16, 1858, Lawrence became the county seat of Douglas County.Kansas Territory Legislature (1858), pp. 21819.Andreas (1883), p. 310. In February 1858, the Kansas government approved an anti- slavery charter for Lawrence. James Blood became the first mayor of Lawrence.Andreas (1883), p. 326. The anti-slavery Kansas government met in Lawrence many times. In practice, Lawrence became the capital of Kansas from 1858 until 1861. === American Civil War and Kansas becoming a state === On October 4, 1859, the people of Kansas voted to approve the Wyandotte Constitution. There were 10,421 \"yes\" votes and 5,530 \"no\" votes. The United States Congress approved the Wyandotte Constitution. Kansas became a free state on January 29, 1861. Pro-slavery people in Kansas knew they had lost. Kansas becoming a free state ended Bleeding Kansas. However, the American Civil War began around the same time. During the war, many Jayhawkers stayed in Lawrence. These Jayhawkers went to Missouri. They stole items and burned farms there. Many people in the Confederacy believed that the stolen items were in Lawrence.Drago (1998), pp. 45. On August 21, 1863, a pro-slavery man named William Quantrill rode into Lawrence with some men. They destroyed much of the town. They killed every adult man they saw. More than 150 men and boys died. There was 2,000,000 dollars worth of property destroyed. The Plymouth Congregational Church was not destroyed, but many of its people died. This attack is known as the Lawrence massacre. After Quantrill's Raid, the people and Union soldiers rebuilt the city.Cordley (1895), pp. 25156. It was not easy because the winter was very cold. They continued rebuilding until they finished in 1864.Cordley (1895), pp. 25354, 256. While they were rebuilding, the people of Lawrence were afraid of another attack.Cordley (1895), p. 254. The military built some camps in Lawrence to guard the city, but no more attacks happened. After the Civil War, the camps were closed and removed.Bisel and Martin (2013). === After the Civil War === There was a plan to build a university in Kansas in 1855, but it did not happen until Kansas became a state in 1861.Andreas (1883), pp. 324–25. The Kansas government needed to decide where to build the university. Their choices were Manhattan, Emporia, or Lawrence. On January 13, 1863, Kansas State University was built in Manhattan. However, the Kansas government decided to build another one. The only cities left where a university could be built were Emporia and Lawrence. Amos A. Lawrence gave $10,000 and more than 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land for a university in Lawrence. The Kansas government liked that, so the government chose Lawrence. The University of Kansas opened in 1866. In 1864, Lawrence got its first railroad. It connected Lawrence to Kansas City. The first train to go to Lawrence went on November 28, 1864. Kansas Historical Society's timeline of railroads in Kansas. The first train to cross the Kansas River crossed it in Lawrence on November 1, 1867. The Kansas Historical Quarterly, August 1947 (Vol. 15, No. 3), pages 225-239. In the early 1870s, Lawrence needed more electricity. The city asked Orlando Darling to build a dam on the Kansas River. Darling became angry because it took a long time to build a dam, so he stopped. The Lawrence Land & Water Company finished building the dam in 1873. The dam made Lawrence special because few cities had a dam. The dam closed in 1968, but the city reopened it in 1977. They wanted to build a new city hall next to the dam. Today, the dam helps prevent flooding. In 1863, the first windmill in Kansas was built in Lawrence. John Peterson's 1980 article about the windmill and its history. It burned during Quantrill's Raid. In 1864, people rebuilt it. It cost them $9,700. Some info about the windmill. People used it until July 1895. On April 30, 1905, the windmill burned, and it was not rebuilt. In 1884, a school for Native Americans was built in Lawrence. It was named the United States Industrial Training School. Boys learned farming, blacksmithing, and more. Girls learned cooking and homemaking. In 1887, the name changed to the Haskell Institute. It was named after Dudley Haskell, a state legislator who helped make sure the school was built in Lawrence. In 1993, it was renamed the Haskell Indian Nations University. === 20th century === In 1888, Jabez B. Watkins opened the Watkins National Bank at 11th Street and Massachusetts Street. It closed in 1929. The building was given to the city to become the city hall. In 1970, Lawrence built a new city hall, so the building became a museum. It was called the Watkins Community Museum, and it opened in 1975. In 1903, the Kansas River flooded, which did a lot of damage.Dary, David. Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas: An Informal History. Lawrence: Allen Press, 1981. The water was high. The damage in North Lawrence was very bad. Lawrence was hit by other floods in 1951, when the water was 30 feet high. It was hit again in 1993. However, the damage was not very bad because of the reservoir and a levee. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt came to Lawrence. He gave a short speech, and he dedicated a fountain at 9th & New Hampshire Street. In 1910, Roosevelt came to Lawrence again after visiting Osawatomie. In 1871, the Lawrence Street Railway Company was created. It made it easy for people to go to hotels and businesses on Massachusetts Street. They had the first streetcar in Lawrence. Horses and mules pulled the streetcar. They could be used only on Massachusetts Street. After the 1903 flood, the Kansas River Bridge had to be rebuilt. It was not safe for streetcars to go on the bridge. The Lawrence Street Railway Company closed in 1903. In 1902, C. L. Rutter tried to start a bus system. He failed. In 1907, he tried again. In 1909, a new streetcar system was built which caused Rutter's buses to close. The streetcar system stayed until 1935. In 1909, the streetcar company made a roller coaster. It was called \"Casey's Coaster.\" Some people called it \"Daisy's Dozer.\" It was made out of wood. It stayed until the 1920s. pg.1, top-right column. Lawrence Journal-World, mentioning the coaster. In 1921, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital opened with 50 beds. By 1980, it had 200 beds. It has won many awards for good quality care and service. In 1929, Lawrence had its 75th birthday. To celebrate, a big rock was placed. It is called \"Founder's Rock\" to remember the early settlers who came to Lawrence from the New England Emigrant Aid Company. On October 14, 1929, they opened the Lawrence Municipal Airport to the public. In 1943, during World War II, the United States government brought prisoners of war to Lawrence. They were mostly German and Italian people. The government brought them because farmers needed more workers. They were forced to live in camps which were like prisons. Lawrence's camp was near 11th Street and Haskell Avenue. The camp closed in 1945.List of Prisoner Of War (POW) Camps in Kansas , Genealogy Tracer In 1983, a famous movie, The Day After, was filmed in Lawrence. The movie is about a fictional nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1989, the Lawrence Free State Brewing Company opened on Massachusetts Street. It was the first brewery in Kansas in over 100 years. The brewery is also a restaurant. In 2007, U.S. News & World Report said Lawrence was one of the best places to retire. In 2011, Parents & Colleges said Lawrence was one of the 10 best college towns in the United States. == Geography == Lawrence is in northeastern Kansas. It is about east of Topeka and west of Kansas City, Kansas. The tallest place in Lawrence is Mount Oread at the University of Kansas, which is tall. Lawrence is on the southern part of the Dissected Till Plains. To the south are the Osage Plains. The United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of . Of that, is land and is water. Lawrence is between the Kansas River and the Wakarusa River. Many creeks flow through Lawrence. The Wakarusa River was dammed to create Clinton Lake. The University of Kansas has a small lake called Potter's Lake. The Haskell-Baker Wetlands is a big area with wetlands, plants, trails, and more. They are supported by Haskell University and Baker University. The wetlands are southeast of Lawrence. Lawrence has 54 parks, cemeteries, and community parks. LawrenceKS – Parks & Trails. The community parks are South Park, Buford Watson Park, Broken Arrow Park, Riverfront Park, Holcomb Park, \"Dad\" Perry Park, Centennial Park and Prairie Park. Cemeteries include Oak Hill, Maple Grove and Memorial Park. Pioneer Cemetery is a cemetery that has some of the earliest people from Lawrence. It was created in 1854. It is at the University of Kansas. === Climate === Lawrence has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), so it has hot and humid summers, with cold and dry winters. The highest temperature recorded was on August 11, 1934. The lowest temperature recorded was on February 12, 1899. Every year, it gets of precipitation on average. Most of it happens during the summer. == City design == === Streets === The main street in Lawrence is called Massachusetts Street. Many early residents of Lawrence came because of the New England Emigrant Aid Company which was from Massachusetts.Brackman (1997), p. 22. Streets that went north and south were named after US states in the order they became part of the country. Streets that go east and west were name after famous Revolutionary War heroes. Page 2, Section \"Chart of Lawrence\" (4th column, in the center). Over time, people broke the first rule. Some states were never used, and some states were put in the wrong order. In 1913, the east and west streets became numbered streets. === Neighborhoods === Lawrence is organized into neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are close to downtown Lawrence like Old West Lawrence, North Lawrence, East Lawrence, Oread, Hancock and Pinckney. There are a few neighborhoods west of Iowa Street like Sunset Hills, Prairie Meadows, Deerfield, and Alvamar. Some neighborhoods are on the National Register of Historic Places like Old West Lawrence, Oread, Hancock, Breezedale, and most of Rhode Island Street in East Lawrence. ==== North Lawrence ==== North Lawrence is a neighborhood north of the Kansas River. It used to be its own place called Grant Township. It renamed itself North Lawrence in 1869. Lawrence claimed it in 1870. Northeast of North Lawrence, there was a popular park called Bismarck Grove. Kansas Historical Society's entry for Bismarck Grove. Autumn 1969 (Vol. 35, No. 3), pages 225 to 256. In the late 1800s, the park had picnics, fairs, and temperance meetings (meetings about getting rid of alcohol). The first meeting was in 1878. The park had its last fair in 1899. In 1900, the park closed and was sold.Lewis (1969). === Architecture === There are many architecture styles in Lawrence. This is just for the Barker neighborhood, and it lists Queen Anne, Italianate, National Folk, Folk Victorian, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Mission, Tudor Revival, Gothic Revival, Craftsman Bungalow, Prairie, Minimal Traditional, Ranch, Split Level, Modern Movement, Post Modern, and Vernacular as architectural styles. Many early buildings were burned in Quantrill's Raid.
