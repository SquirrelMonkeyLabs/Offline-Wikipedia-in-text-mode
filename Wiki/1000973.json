 "text": "Tromsø is a municipality in Troms county, Norway, with an area and a population of 77,992. The city center of Tromsø is located on the island of Tromsøya, but the urban area also surrounds part of the nearby mainland and part of the island Kvaløya. Tromsø is known for its nice weather because it's up north but still gets warm ocean water from the Gulf Stream. Tromsø's latitude of just below 70°N means there’s an annual midnight sun and polar night depending on the season. The city has a rich Norse and Sámi heritage, with evidence of them living there since the end of the ice age. The name Tromsø is believed to come from the Old Norse name of the island Trums, which means \"(strong) current.\" However, the first part of the name's etymology is uncertain. Tromsø is a cultural hub for the region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Many countries used to have consulates or missions in Tromsø in the 1990s. ==Related pages== *List of mayors in Norway that are elected until 2027 ==References== Category:Tromsø",
