 "text": "The Fajr-5 (, \"Dawn\") is an Iranian rocket launcher for long range rockets. The Fajr-5 was developed during the 1990's and has been sent to many militant groups in the Middle East. The Fajr 5 rocket has a variant with GPS called the Fajr 5C but most Fajr 5 rockets do not have GPS to hit targets with 100% accuracy. The Fajr 5 is mainly used by the Iranian Army Ground Force to attack targets such as airfields and military bases. The Fajr 5 is also used to target Israel by some members of the Axis of Resistance which are Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). ==Notes== == References == Category:Military of Iran Category:Weapons",
