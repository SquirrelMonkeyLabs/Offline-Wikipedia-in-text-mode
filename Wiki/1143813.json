The attack caused damage to the facilities at the crossing, and the Erez Crossing stayed closed during the Israel–Hamas war that followed until 1 May 2024, when it was reopened for aid transports heading into the Gaza Strip. == Related pages == * Israel–Hamas war * 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel == References == Category:7 October attacks Category:Blockade of the Gaza Strip",
