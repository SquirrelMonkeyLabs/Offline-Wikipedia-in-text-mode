His channel also serves content farms and their ability to game the YouTube algorithms, giving attention to their media content, that can be seen to encourage behavior, whether regarding animated story channels based on untrue accounts or unproductive, or even dangerous, life hacks, popularized by the 5-Minute Crafts and Bright Side channels, which are managed by TheSoul Publishing. ==Reputation== In August 2018, traffic to Johnson's channel increased when another YouTuber, called Cody Ko, uploaded a video about 5-Minute Crafts, a topic that Johnson had already spoken about.

The video in the tweet was then taken down by the creator of the video a mere 2 days later. ==Ownership stake== In July 2021, Rhett and Link announced that their production company, Mythical Entertainment, had got an ownership stake in the umbrella company Johnson founded for his various revenue streams. == Awards and nominations == Year Award Category Result 2020 11th Shorty Awards YouTube Commentary 10th Streamy Awards Commentary 2021 11th Streamy Awards Commentary == Notes == == References == Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:American YouTubers Category:American software engineers",
