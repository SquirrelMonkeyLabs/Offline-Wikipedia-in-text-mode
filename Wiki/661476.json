The American psychologist James Cattell (1860–1944) studied with Galton and then, in 1890, published a classic paper Mental Tests and Measurements.Cattell F.M. 1890. Mental tests and measurements.

ISBN 9780205354726 The definition of a psychological test is \"an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior\".Aiken, Lewis R. 1998. Tests and examinations: measuring abilities and performance. Wiley. ISBN 9780471192633 The kind of tests which were developed included: *Intelligence tests: how well a person solves problems. *Aptitude tests: how well a person is suited to a particular task or role. *Personality tests: what kind of person an individual is. Psychologists who give these tests have training and qualifications which tell the employer that they are certified to give the tests and assess (understand) the results. == References == Category:Psychometrics",
