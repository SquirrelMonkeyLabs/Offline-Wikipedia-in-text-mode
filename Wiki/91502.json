 "text": "Edward, the Black Prince (Woodstock Palace, Oxfordshire, 15 June 1330 – Westminster Palace, 8 June 1376) was the eldest son of King Edward III of England. He was elevated Duke of Cornwall in 1337. Edward was born at Woodstock Palace, near Oxford. He was made Prince of Wales in 1343 and followed his father into battle against France. He became a famous soldier by helping to win the Battle of Crécy and commanding the Battle of Poitiers. He was a founding member of the Order of the Garter. In 1361, he married his cousin, Joan of Kent. They had two sons, Edward and Richard. The older son, Edward, died when he was only six. Edward of Woodstock has become known in history as \"the Black Prince\", because he, like many other soldiers, dipped his armour in tar to stop it rusting. He died at the age of 45 and was buried at the Canterbury Cathedral. As his father was still living, he never became king himself. He asked his father to give the title Prince of Wales to his son Richard, who later became King Richard II of England. ==Notes== Category:1330 births Category:1376 deaths Category:House of Plantagenet Category:People from Oxfordshire Category:Princes and Princesses of Wales",
