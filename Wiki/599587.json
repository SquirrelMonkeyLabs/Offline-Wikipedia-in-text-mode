 "text": "Oneirology (; from Greek ὄνειρον, oneiron, \"dream\"; and -λογία, -logia, \"the study of\") is the scientific study of dreams. Current research seeks connections between dreaming and current knowledge about how the brain works, as well as understanding of how the brain works during dreaming as pertains to memory formation and mental disorders. The study of Oneirology can mean from dream interpretation in that the aim is to quantitatively study the process of dreams instead of analyzing the meaning behind them. Oneirology is about dreams and how they work. Most dreams happen in the REM [rapid eye movement] phase of their sleep. Dreams can have a good chance of coming true. Lucid dreaming is when the dreamer gains some control over their dream. The LDR Squad studies lucid dreams. ==Related pages== * Rapid eye movement ==More readings== * Aserinsky, E. and N.
