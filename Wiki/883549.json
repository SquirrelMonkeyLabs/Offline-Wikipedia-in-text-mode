 "text": "Space tourism is human space travel for non-government reasons such as private or entertainment reasons. There are many different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. SpaceX is planning to send a space tourist to the Moon. == Space Tourism Companies == Key player in this sectorː * Virgin Galacticː Richard Branson's space company outpaced Blue Origin (Bezos) and SpaceX (Musk), achieving the milestone of launching his aircraft/rocket Unity 22 toward the stars first among the three. Their flight reached a height of just 86 km, marking the lowest trajectory. Branson was accompanied by a crew of five on this historic journey. * Blue Originː The aerospace company founded by Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon and the world's richest man, celebrated the 52nd anniversary of the first Moon landing by launching into orbit in his rocket, the New Shepard on 20 July 1969. Jeff Bezos and his brother Mark were accompanied by two other crew members on this voyage to space that lasted for ten minutes and ten seconds. * SpaceXː In September, SpaceX, the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, carried four civilians into space. They spent three days orbiting the Earth at an altitude of approximately 540 kilometers, a distance surpassing any other human space flight since the Hubble missions, according to the company. Each ticket for this extraordinary journey carried a price tag of 50 million dollars. ==References== Category:Tourism Category:Spaceflight",
