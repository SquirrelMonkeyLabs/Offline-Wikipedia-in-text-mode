 "text": "The palm rocket frog (Rheobates palmatus) is a frog. Scientists found it in Colombia. ==Home== These frogs live in streams that have trees growing around them. Some of them can live in places where cows eat grass, but they cannot live in streams where all the trees nearby have been cut down. Scientists saw it between 250 and 2520 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in one protected place: Parque Nacional Natural Serranía de Los Yariguíes. ==Young== These frogs lay eggs all year. They go to bodies of water that are not deep. The female frog lays eggs on the ground. The male frog watches the eggs. He pushes other frogs away if they come too close to the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives. People cut down trees to make farms and places for cows to eat grass. Droughts can also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
