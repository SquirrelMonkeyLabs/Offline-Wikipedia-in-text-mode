Then the Aryans entered it at successive intervals and fought the indigenous people, and after they had what they wanted to seize the dwellings of the indigenous people, they imposed their systems on them and made the indigenous people their slaves and servants, and considered them impure, so they did not mix with them, but rather tried to preserve the purity of their race. Ancient Dravidian Indians were the descendant of Ham, one of the sons of Noah, and the Aryans were the descendants of Japheth, another of the three remained sons of Noah after the Biblical great flood, ===Religion origin=== Hinduism is a complex religion made up of diverse customs and traditions from many different peoples and nations. Hinduism at its beginning was called Vedic Dharma, or the religion attributed to the Vedas, or Sanatan Dahrma, or the ancient religion. Then it passed through stages and roles, until it was later known as the Hindu religion, and it has no specific founder. ===Spread of religion=== Hinduism is spread all over the world, and it is the third largest in terms of the number of its adherents. ===Hindu sources=== All Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, are claimed to be adaptations of the beliefs of the migrated Japhethite Aryans (Zoroastrians and Rigvedians), indigenous Hemite Dravidians, and other Indo-European classical mythologies along with the influence of monotheism taken from Avestan concept of Ahura Mazda influenced by tha geographically adjacent Arabian Semitic people, as he claimed. The sources of authentic Hinduism are the Vedas, but they are in the darkness of history in terms of determining the date of their codification, their codification, and in terms of their explanation and interpretations, which made them puzzles and riddles. One of the original Hindu sources is the Upanishads, which contain very complex philosophies, but end up saying the pantheism. There are late Hindu sources, some books of philosophy, Ramain and Yoga Vashishtha, Puranas, books of Dharma Shashtra, Mahabharat and Gita, but all these books lack chains, as they do not know exactly when these books were written, and many of them do not know Hindus about their bloggers. Myths and legends are the prominent feature of these sources. ===Hinduism beliefs=== The belief of the Hindus differed from stage to stage, where we notice in the books of the Vedas some signs of monotheism in the lordship, and in the time of the Upanishads, the doctrine of the unity of existence (Wahdat al-Wujud) was dominant. As for the Hindu belief in divinity, their belief differed greatly, but the worship of multiple gods is the general characteristic for them, and their devotions differed from stage to stage. The latter, they worshiped everything from idols, idols, and natural appearances. Among the most important Hindu deities in the current era: Vishnu, and his avatars (attars) of Ram, Krishna, and others. Shiva, his two sons: Ganesh and Kartik, and his wives, including: Kali, Durga. Hinduism has greatly influenced other world religions, including Judaism and Christianity, in their beliefs, customs and traditions. Hinduism does not have a correct or sound conception of creation and the universe, as the beliefs it presents in this regard are all turbulent, conflicting and contradictory, and its view of life is pessimistic and unrealistic. Hinduism recognizes the unjust and unjust class, and applies it in its societies, where it divides people into sections that make some of them in the status of gods, and some of them lower than animals. In its early stages, Hinduism believed in the Last Day, but this belief quickly changed in the later ages. One of the most important beliefs of the Hindus is the belief in the incarnation of God, and His descent in the form of some creatures. Hinduism does not see the revelation of revelation, nor the sending of messengers, although some of them stop at the issue of sending messengers. One of the most important beliefs of the Hindus is the doctrine of the Penal Law, which includes the gods and all people. The gods and people are all under this law. One of the motto of the Hindu religion is the doctrine of reincarnation, (the doctrine of rebirth). the core of Hindu belief is the creed of moksha or nirvana. Hinduism believes in the cyclical life, meaning that the world ends and then comes another world, and there is no end to this process at all. Today's Hinduism believes in temporary heaven and hell, in which there is no eternity. ===Hindu religious rites and rituals=== The rituals of worship in the Hindu religion are turbulent, all of which serve the interest of a certain group of people, namely the Brahmins. Daily worship is reserved for the class of Brahmins, and as for the rest of the classes, they do not have a specific worship. The Hindu legislation relating to the system of marriage and divorce is unlawful and unjust, which has its negative effects in their societies. The ceremonies and rituals relating to children and discipleship rites are full of primitive matters. The legislation relating to the dead is harsh; Where they cremate their dead and philosophize about its merits, just as it is good for widows to burn themselves with the dead husband. One of the most important purposes of marriage for them is; That the children offer sacrifices for the souls of the fathers and grandfathers, otherwise the souls of the fathers and grandfathers will remain in the darkness of fire for them. The books of Hindus authorize the permissibility of adultery for some members of the community, and they also allow the permissibility of tyranny for the sake of children. ===Hindu customs and traditions=== One of the most important features of the Hindu religion is the abundance of feasts, as it did not make the lower classes a dedicated worship, so they occupied it with feasts, weddings and occasions. The Hindus divide life into four roles: the first role is devoted to seeking knowledge from a certain sheikh, the second to family life, the third to worship, and the fourth to monasticism, leaving the house, and a life of misery and misery. Hinduism sees beggary, torture of the body, and fighting sanctuary as acts of worship, and for these matters it has defined systems and principles. ===Hindu teams=== In Hinduism there are five main sects, the most famous of which are the Vishnu sects, and the Shaiva sects, and these sects have divided into countless sects. Among the most important features of late Hinduism are the Vedantic philosophy (the philosophy of the unity of existence) and the Bhakti philosophy (the philosophy of worshiping God with love alone). Late Hinduism is marked by terror, violence, and hostility. Hindus are trying to put obstacles to the spread of Islam in India by all means. ===The influence of Hinduism on some Islamic groups=== Hinduism has influenced many sects affiliated with Islam, until they came out with these beliefs from the creed of the seventy-three sects. The Sufis were influenced in many of their principles and customs by some of the beliefs and customs of Hinduism, the most important of which are the doctrine of unity of existence (Wahdat Al-Wujud), the doctrine of solutions, union (Ittihad) and annihilation, the obligation to accompany the Sheikh, tourism, striving, waiting for disclosure, and others. Sub sects of Sufis are Tabligh Jamaat, Ahmadiyaas etc. It also shows the similarity of the Rafidah Shiites and Hinduism in many beliefs and customs, which makes the Shiites affected by them a more likely and strong possibility. Many Muslims of the Indian subcontinent have been influenced by some of the customs and traditions of Hinduism. == Chapter == This book is written in three volumes of a total of 1,510 pages.https://web.archive.org/web/20240815141102/https://ecat.kfnl.gov.sa/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=17237K96T04B6.186492&profile;=akfnl&uri;=full=3100006@!381560@!5&ri;=8&aspect;=basic_search&menu;=search&source;=172.27.18.27@!kfnl1256&ipp;=20&staffonly;=&term;=%C3%98%C2%B2%C3%99%C2%83%C3%98%C2%B1%C3%99%C2%8A%C3%98%C2%A7+%C3%98%C2%8C+%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%98%C2%A8%C3%99%C2%88+%C3%98%C2%A8%C3%99%C2%83%C3%98%C2%B1+%C3%99%C2%85%C3%98%C2%AD%C3%99%C2%85%C3%98%C2%AF&index;=&uindex;=&aspect;=basic_search&menu;=search&ri;=8 * Part 1: Introduction to Hinduism and its sources * Part II Law doctrine and religion of the Hindus, and invitation to Islam * Part III: Influence of Hinduism on some Islamic sects == Reception == Abdullah bin Salam al-Batati praised the book in the \"Al-Khajana\" program of Zad TV owned by Muhammad al Munajjid and had a direct telephone conversation with the book's publisher.
