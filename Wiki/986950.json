The book's title, The Yearling, comes from the word for a young deer that is about one year old. == The Story == The Yearling tells the story of a boy named Jody Baxter. He lives in Florida in the years after the American Civil War. He is the only living child of poor parents who had six other children who died when they were very young. One day while Jody and his father are searching for their lost farm animals, his father is bitten in the arm by a rattlesnake. Father shoots a female deer, in order to use its liver to pull out the snake's poison. Father's life is saved. But the dead deer had a fawn, a young deer. Jody's parents let him keep the young deer. The boy and the deer, named Flag, grow together closely. These are difficult times for farm families in Florida. Jody learns about these troubles. Flag causes a problem when he eats the corn that the family is growing for their own food. Jody's father tells him to go into the woods and shoot Flag, but Jody can't do it. When Jody's mother shoots and only wounds the yearling, Jody is forced to kill Flag. Jody leaves home in anger. He suffers from hunger, loneliness, and fear on his journey to find an old friend who lives in Boston. In the last chapter, back home with his father, he realizes that he has joined \"the world o' men\". He knows that the time of his boyhood is over. == After the Novel == A film was made of the book and was released to theaters in 1946. Gregory Peck played Jody's father.
