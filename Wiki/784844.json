 "text": "Women who have sex with women (WSW) are women who engage in sexual activities with other women. They may be lesbian, heterosexual or bisexual. They may not at all have any sexual identity. The term WSW is used often in medical literature to describe such women in a clinical study. Lesbians are less likely than heterosexual or bisexual women to get screened for cervical cancer. Some are refused medical screenings by medical professionals. The lower rate of lesbians tested by regular pap smears makes it more difficult to detect cervical cancer at early stages in these women. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbian women. Many doctors find woman-to-woman sex to have negligible risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The doctors fail to offer any information on prevention of STI transmission for sex between two females. Lesbians have a lower rate of getting STIs than heterosexual or bisexual women, although the risk still exists. Dental dams, sex toys and cling wraps are often used as protection when one woman has sex with another woman. ==Related pages== *Men who have sex with men ==References== Category:LGBT",
