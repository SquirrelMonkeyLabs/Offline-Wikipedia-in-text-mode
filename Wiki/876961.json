Dubbed as the \"Einstein of palmistry,\" he is a disciple of the saint Paramahamsa. Vikramaditya, who does not believe in relationships, instantly falls for doctor Prerana. They meet on a train but separate thereafter. One day, Vikramaditya reads the palm of businessman Anand Rajput. As Vikramaditya does not predict the future in his favour, Rajput's men chase him which results in his accident. He admits into Prerana's hospital and is treated there. After recovering, Vikramaditya proposes Prerana to be in a firtationship with him. Prerana, however, leaves the town but Vikramaditya follows her all the way. She accepts and they begin to date each other. Prerana's uncle, however, asks her not to develop any feelings towards Vikramaditya. ===Travel on train=== When Vikramaditya and Prerana are traveling on a train, a stranger requests him to read the palm of his daughter, an aspiring archer. He predicts that she does not have any future in sports, and she should instead focus on education. Amazed by Vikramaditya's skill, everyone in the coach ask for predictions by showing their palm but Vikramaditya hesitantly gets down along with Prerana. However, he realizes that everyone on the train is destined to an immediate death. He chases the train to stop it but in vain. Later that evening, the train meets an accident, leading to several casualties. Prerana, who starts to believe in palmistry, asks Vikramaditya to read her palm. He predicts that she would have a long life with a bright future but she faints immediately with a bleeding nose. Prerana is admitted to the hospital where her uncle, who is also a doctor, reveals that she is suffering from an incurable tumor and may die within months. Vikramaditya disagrees since he predicted otherwise but is thrown out of the hospital. ===Hope=== Prerana is now hopeful of her life. Her uncle, on the other hand, believes Vikramaditya is a fraud and only medicine can change her fate. He tests Vikramaditya with dead people's palms, and Vikramaditya deduces all of them correctly. Her uncle changes his mind and trusts Vikramaditya's prediction. As expected, a cure for Prerana's disease was found. Filled with happiness, Prerana proposes Vikramaditya. However, he rejects her saying, he cannot love her as he does not possess a \"love-line\" and would be leaving the country soon. Dejected Prerana attempts to suicide with grief but comes across Vikramaditya's diary. She learns that Vikramaditya was prepared to sacrifice his life to save her. Before leaving, Vikramaditya takes Prerana to a ballroom dance as per her wish and the couple spends the night intimately. Prerana leaves a note in the diary that she'd choose to give up her life instead when such situation arises. She willingly meets a car accident and is admitted to the hospital. ===In London=== Vikramaditya is in London for her mother's dance show. She reads Prerana's note in the diary. He calls the hospital and is shocked to know the condition of Prerana. He urges Prerana to live, promising to meet her soon. When Vikramaditya is in a dilemma about his prediction, he comes across the girl in the train who has lost her hand in the accident. She tells Vikramaditya that since she does not have a palm now, she can write her destiny. Vikramaditya who is now in hurry to meet Prerana boards on a cargo ship to Italy which is captained by a person he met in the hospital. However, the ship is caught by a storm in the sea and everyone abandons the ship on the captain's orders. Vikramaditya, however, is trapped in the ship alone. Overwhelmed by the force of nature, Vikramaditya struggles for survival. He recalls his guru Paramahamsa's assertion that palmistry is only 99% accurate, and there are 1% of the people who script their own destiny. Determined to be alive, he uses all his strength to reach a high point and fires a flare gun. The captain returns with a lifeboat. The ship sinks but the drowned Vikramaditya manages to be afloat. Later, Vikramaditya arrives at the hospital and reunites with the recovered Prerana. == Cast == * Prabhas as Vikramaditya, a palmist * Pooja Hegde as Prerana, a doctor * Jayaram as Jayaraj Ship Captain (Cameo Appearance) * Krishnam Raju as Paramahamsa (Telugu) * Sathyaraj as Paramahamsa (Hindi) * Jagapathi Babu * Sachin Khedekar * Priyadarshi * Murali Sharma * Kunaal Roy Kapur * Sathyan * Jayaram * Flora Jacob as Indira Gandhi * Sasha Chettri == Production == The movie was launched on 5 September 2018 tentatively titled as #Prabhas20.
