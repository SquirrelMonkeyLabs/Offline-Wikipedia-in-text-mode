It was pitched at Sheffield Doc/Fest's MeetMarket in 2008. ==Reception== The film got positive reviews. Both members of Silibil 'N Brains like the film but find it \"bizarre\" to watch with other people. ==References== ==Other websites== *www.hiphophoax.com The Great Hip-Hop Hoax official site * * Category:2013 documentary movies Category:British documentary movies Category:Hoaxes Category:2010s English-language movies",
