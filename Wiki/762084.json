 "text": "Salar de Uyuni (or Salar de Tunupa) is the world's largest salt flat. It is over in area. It is in Potos√≠ in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes at an height of 3,656 metres (11,995 ft) above sea level. The crust serves as a source of salt and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium. It contains 50% to 70% of the world's known lithium reserves. The large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the surface make the Salar ideal for calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites. == References == Category:Minerals Category:Geography of Bolivia",
