The association promotes healthy living to bring awareness for heart disease, as well as for stroke and heart attack, in the hope to stop it. It is the oldest heart health group in the United States. == History == === Beginnings (1915-1924) === In 1915, doctors of medicine and social workers would come together in New York City. They wanted to know things about heart disease, as it was very dangerous to have at the time. These groups of people would form the Association for the Prevention and Relief of Heart Disease, which would be the organization before the American Heart Association. By the early 1920s, there were a lot of organizations in towns and cities, but they were spread out. As a result of this, the organization saw the need to have one, connected effort. on June 10, 1924, Six doctors, Lewis A. Conner, Robert H. Halsey, James B. Herrick, Paul D. White, Joseph Sailer, and Hugh D. MuCulloch would come together in Chicago to form the American Heart Association, with the connection making them able to spread information more easily, and research more easily. The connection also let the organization effectively raise money and talk for public health policies. ==References== Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States",
