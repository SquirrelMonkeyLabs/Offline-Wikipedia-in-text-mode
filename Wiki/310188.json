 "text": "Pietro Paolo Giovanni Ernesto Baracchi (1851â€“1926) was an Italian astronomer. He moved to Australia in the 1870s and worked at the Melbourne Observatory. In 1910 the Australian government asked him to find a suitable place for an observatory in the new Australian Capital Territory. Barrachi set up a small observatory on Mount Stromlo in May 1911. This was the first government building in Canberra and was the beginning of the Mount Stromlo Observatory. The observatory had a 9-inch (23 cm) telescope, donated by Ballarat gold miner, James Oddie. ==References== Category:1851 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Italian astronomers",
