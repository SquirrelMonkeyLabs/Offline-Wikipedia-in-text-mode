 "text": "Prince William of Gloucester (William Henry Andrew Frederick; 18 December 1941 - 28 August 1972) was a grandson of King George V and a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. At the time of his birth he was fourth in line to the throne, and ninth in line at the time of his death. ==Life== He graduated from Cambridge and Stanford. He then joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, serving in Lagos and Tokyo, before returning to take over royal duties. He led an active life, flying Piper aircraft, trekking through the Sahara, and even ballooning. He is still the most recent child of George III to be diagnosed with porphyria. Porphyria is widely believed to be the illness that most likely caused George III's mental breakdown. Prince William died in 1972, aged 30, in an air crash while piloting his plane in a competition. ==References== Category:British royalty Category:House of Windsor Category:British princes Category:1941 births Category:1972 deaths",
