 "text": "Classical crossover is a style of music where classical music is performed in a popular modern style that is different to how that music was originally performed. It can also refer to popular performers who normally play rock music or other popular music, but adapt their music into a classical music style like Orchestral music. There are other performers who take Classical repertoire and perform it in modern styles like rock or dance music. One example of this is the band called \"Classical Made Modern\". == References == Category:Popular culture Category:Music genres",
