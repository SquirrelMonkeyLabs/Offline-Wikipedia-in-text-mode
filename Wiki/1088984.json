 "text": "Bobasatrania is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish that lived during the Triassic. It’s best known from beds of Changhsingian to Ladinian age. It is one of the most famous survivors of the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Bobasatrania originated during the Lopingian epoch. Bobasatrania is part of the Bobasatraniiformes. The type species was named after Bobasatrana (near Ambilobe) in northeast Madagascar. The species is named after a river called the Mahavavy River. == Description == Bobasatrania had a unique diamond-shaped body. It had a forked tail. It did not exceed 30 cm in length. The pectoral fins were thin and elongated. It had large eyes and a small mouth. == Distribution == Fossils have been found in many places (Canada, France, Germany, Greenland, Italy, Madagascar, Spitsbergen, Pakistan, Switzerland, USA). == Classification == On 1932, Errol White discovered the type species, B. mahavavica. Bobasatrania, Dorypterus, Ebenaqua, and Ecrinesomus make up the Bobasatraniiformes, an extinct order of ray-finned fish. === Species === * †Bobasatrania antiqua Accordi, 1955 * †Bobasatrania canadensis Lambe, 1914 * †Bobasatrania ceresiensis Bürgin, 1992 * †Bobasatrania groenlandica Stensiö, 1932 * †Bobasatrania ladina Accordi, 1955 * †Bobasatrania mahavavica White, 1932 (type species) * †Bobasatrania nathorsti Stensiö, 1921 * †Bobasatrania scutata Gervais, 1852 === Synonyms === * †Haywardia Tanner, 1936 * †Lambeichthys Lehman, 1956 == Image gallery == == Related pages == * Ohmdenia * Dorypterus * Platysomus * Colobodus * Chiasmocleis * Microhylidae * Euthynotus * Protosphyraena * Coccosteus * Peipiaosteus * Serenoichthys * Pseudoasthenocormus == References == # Nielsen, Eigil.
