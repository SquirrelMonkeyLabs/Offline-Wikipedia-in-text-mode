 "text": "Multiculturalism is a word describing a society with many various cultures. It is the simple fact of cultural diversity. ==Multicultural society== In a multicultural society, there is not an official culture that is decided by those in charge for everyone. Instead, different cultures are similarly respected. A multicultural society emerges when persons from different countries migrate to one country, or an empire conquers many countries. Tolerance is a great help for multiculturalism. Xenophobia makes it difficult. A multicultural society would be composed of those from different ethnic backgrounds and cultures living and working together. Those from different backgrounds link with one another's culture, which shows the acceptance of their culture and background. ==Related pages== * Multilingualism * Cultural assimilation * Multiculturalism in Canada Category:Sociology Category:Cultural studies",
