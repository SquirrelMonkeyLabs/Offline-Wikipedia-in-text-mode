It was started by Christian-democratic parties in 1976. Since then it now has parties with other centre-right political perspectives. On 31 May 2022, the party elected as its President Manfred Weber, who was their candidate for President of the European Commission in 2019. It has been the largest party in the European Parliament since 1999 and in the European Council since 2002. It is also the largest party in the current European Commission. Ursula von der Leyen and Roberta Metsola are members. For the 2024 European Parliament election Weber is talking about stability and security for Europe. He says jobs, defence, migration and the “fight against criminals” are the most important things. ==References== Category:Political parties in Europe",
