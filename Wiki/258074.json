 "text": "Chromium(III) chloride is a chemical compound composed of chromium in its +3 oxidation state and chloride ions. It is green when hydrated (attached to water molecules) and purple when anhydrous (not attached to water molecules). It can be formed by dissolving chromium in hydrochloric acid or by dissolving chromium(III) oxide in hydrochloric acid. Chromium in its +3 oxidation state is much less toxic than chromium in its +6 oxidation state, such as chromates. ==Related pages== *Chromium(III) oxide *Chromate *Chromium Category:Chloride salts Category:Chromium compounds",
