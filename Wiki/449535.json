 "text": "Lossy compression is a form of data compression where parts of the data are lost in the process.Khalid Sayood, Lossless Compression Handbook (Amsterdam; Boston: Academic Press, 2003), p. xix When a compressed data is returned to normal some data is lost. Lossy compression is used to greatly reduce the size of a computer file when it is stored, handled, or transmitted. As an example, JPEG is a lossy compression format.Peter Bauer, Using Adobe Illustrator 10 (Indianapolis, IN; Great Britain: Que, 2002), p. 43 GIF and PNG are lossless compression systems. Other lossy compression systems are MP3 for sound files and WMV for video. If a file were to be compressed too much, it would cause the file to be noticeably lower in quality. == References == Category:Data structures Category:Computer file formats Category:Data compression",
