 "text": "Permanganic acid is an acid. It has the formula HMnO4. It is the acid form of the permanganate ion. It is often made by reacting dilute sulfuric acid with a permanganate, such aspotassium permanganate. It is not usually a good idea to use concentrated acid because the extra acid may react with the new permanganic acid to create manganese heptoxide, an explosive chemical.
