 "text": "During the Putumayo genocide (1879-1912), the Peruvian Amazon Company systematically killed and enslaved indigenous people in the Amazon. Estimates say that the Peruvian Amazon Company killed between 40.000 and 250.000 indigenous people during the genocide. == History == In the late 19th century, rubber was discovered in the Amazon Basin. Rubber was very valuable at the time, and the Peruvian Amazon Comany was responsible for harvesting it. When they did, they forced people to work as slaves. Most of the genocide happened in the area between Río Putumayo and Japurá River. Today, this area is on the border between Colombia and Peru. The book The Dream of the Celt by Mario Vargas Llosa describes these events. == Related pages == * Genocide * Slavery * Crimes against humanity ==References== Category:History of Peru Category:Genocide Category:History of Colombia",
