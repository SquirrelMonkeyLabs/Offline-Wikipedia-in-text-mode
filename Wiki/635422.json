 "text": "Panphagia is a sauropodomorph dinosaur. It was described in 2009. It lived around 231 million years ago, during the Late Triassic period in Argentina. The name Panphagia comes from the Greek words pan, meaning \"all\", and phagein, meaning \"to eat\". It was given that name because scientists think it was omnivirous. Panphagia is one of the earliest known dinosaurs. It is an important find which may mark the change of diet in early sauropodomorph dinosaurs. ==Classification== ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Sauropodomorphs",
