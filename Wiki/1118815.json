 "text": "Second-hand is an English term meaning another person had the item before its current owner. This term is often used with clothes, cars, and furniture. A person might choose to buy an expensive item second-hand because the item will be cheaper, because it is not new. A second-hand item can be bought, donated, or given to the new owner. Second-hand is sometimes used as an insult, because a previously-owned item might have wear or damage that makes the item worse than how the item was when it was new. Because second-hand items are either cheap or free, someone who has second-hand items might be poor. However, buying or getting second-hand goods is a form of recycling, which helps the environment. A hand-me-down is a type of second-hand item, usually given from an older family member to a younger one. These items are usually given to the younger person because the older person has outgrown the item (a big brother has grown during puberty, for example, or a parent has gained weight) and it saves money to give the item to a younger person who needs it. Unlike other types of second-hand items, these items have been used by their first owner much more and may be more visible worn or broken. The item may not match the new owner's preferred style (a girl might get her brother's clothes, or a punk son might get their preppy cousin's clothes.) Because this is often done to reduce a family's budget, the recipient of the item may feel forced to use it. Category:Retail Category:Waste Category:Recycling",
