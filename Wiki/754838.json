 "text": "Dr Tiede Herrema (21 April 1921 â€“ 24 April 2020) was a Dutch businessman. He was kidnapped by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1975. He was born in present-day Utrecht. In the 1970s, Herrema ran a wire factory, Ferenka, in the city of Limerick, Ireland. On the morning of 3 October 1975, having just left his home in Castletroy near Limerick, Herrema was kidnapped by two members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The kidnappers wanted the release of three IRA prisoners, including Rose Dugdale. After a massive security operation, the kidnappers were eventually traced on 21 October 1975 to a house in Monasterevin, County Kildare. After a further two-week-long struggle, Herrema was released. Herrema died on 24 April 2020, three days after his 99th birthday. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Dutch businesspeople",
