 "text": "The Kingdom of Amber, later the Kingdom of Jaipur or the Jaipur State, was located in the historic region of Rajputana and was ruled by the Kachwaha Rajput clan. It became a Princely State under the British rule after signing a treaty creating a subsidiary alliance with the Company in the year 1818, after the Third Anglo Maratha war. It got incorporated into the independent India in 1947 and became the part of India by 1949. Upon integration, the ruler was granted a pension and the use of the title \"Maharaja of Jaipur\" by the Government of India. However, the pension, privileges, and the use of the title were ended in 1971 by the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:Rajasthan Category:Indian princely states",
