 "text": "Horology is the study of the measurement of time. The word comes from the Latin horologium. It dates back to ancient civilizations who water clocks to measure time. Now, we use more accurate timekeeping devices, such as mechanical clocks and wristwatches. Today, atomic clocks, which use the vibrations of atoms to keep time, are the most accurate timekeeping devices in existence. Category:Measurement",
