 "text": "The Siege of Jinji (September 1690–January 1698) began when Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb sent Zulfiqar Ali Khan to capture the Maratha-held Jinji Fort after they killed 300 Mughal troops in the Carnatic. Ghazi ud-Din Khan was tasked with securing supply routes and reinforcing Zulfiqar Ali Khan. Rani Mangammal of the Madurai Nayak dynasty also assisted in the siege, which became the longest in Mughal history, lasting eight years.It was fought in four phases in first three phase Marathas were able to defend the fort defeating the Mughals but in 4th and final Phase the fort fell. ==Background== Jinji Fort, under Bijapur's control since 1649, was captured and renovated by Maratha king Shivaji in 1677, who enhanced its defenses with new ramparts, ditches, towers, and basins. It later served as the second capital for Chhatrapati Rajaram to relieve pressure from the Mughal Empire. In response to Maratha victories, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb sent Zulfiqar Ali Khan to besiege the fort. However, its massive size (7 km²), 30 ft high and 66 ft thick walls, 80 ft wide moat, and strategic location made it a formidable stronghold. ==The Siege== ===First Phase (1690-1691)=== The siege of Jinji (1690-1691) was a prolonged conflict between the Mughal forces, led by Zulfiqar Khan, and the Marathas under Rajaram. The Mughals initially faced difficulties due to the fort’s strong defenses and a lack of supplies, prompting them to request help from the English and French. Despite reinforcements, internal tensions, logistical problems, and heavy rains hindered Mughal progress. By November 1690, several Mughal commanders defected to the Marathas, strengthening Rajaram’s defense. Shahaji of Tanjore also provided financial support, enabling the Marathas to continue resisting. In 1691, internal discord among Mughal leaders, particularly between Asad Khan and Prince Kambaksha, weakened the Mughal efforts. The Mughals captured some minor outposts but failed to breach the Jinji fort. By the end of 1691, the Mughal forces had not succeeded in capturing Jinji, and the Marathas remained resilient, marking the first phase of the siege as a failure for the Mughals. ===Second Phase (1692-1693)=== In 1692, the Mughals, led by Prince Kanbaksha, Asad Khan, and Zulfiqar Khan, besieged the Maratha-held fort of Jinji. Despite their numerical superiority, the Mughals struggled due to Maratha resistance, internal rivalries, and logistical challenges. The Marathas, under Rajaram, launched successful raids, disrupted Mughal supply lines, and reinforced their garrison, making the siege increasingly difficult. By the summer of 1692, the Mughals faced food shortages and losses, with Prince Kanbaksha growing frustrated with his commanders. Tensions escalated, leading to his arrest by Asad Khan and Zulfiqar Khan in December. In early 1693, after further Maratha attacks and with no relief in sight, Zulfiqar Khan negotiated a truce, allowing the Mughals to withdraw in exchange for payment. However, Maratha forces, led by Santaji and Rudraji, harassed the retreating Mughal army, which ultimately struggled to reach safety. The failure to capture Jinji highlighted the Marathas’ resilience and strategic diplomacy, while internal Mughal disarray and rivalries led to their retreat. ===Third Phase (1694-1695)=== In 1694, Zulfiqar Khan laid siege to Jinji, cutting off supplies and capturing nearby outposts. Rajaram urgently requested reinforcements from Maratha generals Santaji and Dhanaji, warning that the fort would fall within a month. However, the reinforcements were delayed. Despite this, Zulfiqar Khan hesitated to launch a decisive assault, possibly due to a tacit agreement with Rajaram to prolong the siege. Meanwhile, Yachappa Naik, a Mughal commander, attempted to take Jinji on his own but was exposed for corresponding with Rajaram and executed by Zulfiqar Khan. By late 1694, Zulfiqar Khan faced Maratha raids and poisoned water supplies, and by early 1695, he had moved his camp to Vellore. However, the Marathas under Santaji and Dhanaji arrived in late 1695, forcing Zulfiqar Khan to abandon the siege and retreat. Dhanaji's arrival effectively relieved Jinji without a battle. Zulfiqar Khan tried to pursue but was defeated, leading to a weakening of Mughal forces in Karnatak by the end of the year. The Marathas gained the upper hand as the Mughals struggled with dwindling resources and morale. ===Final Phase (1697-1698)=== The Emperor knew of Zulfiqar Khan's secret alliance with Rajaram but chose not to dismiss him. Despite a lack of resources, the Khan was slow in his siege of Jinji. Rajaram, anticipating danger, planned his escape with help from Khando Ballal, Ganoji Shirke, and Girjoji Yadav. Ganoji, despite his past with the Mughals, was persuaded by Khando Ballal to aid Rajaram due to their kinship. On December 26, 1697, Rajaram escaped, but the siege continued until January 2, 1698, when Jinji fell. Zulfiqar Khan captured the fort but allowed key members of the royal family to escape, likely to maintain his relationship with the Marathas. While the royal family was captured, some, including queens Tarabai and Rajasbai, managed to flee with Girjoji's help. The fort was renamed Nasratgad, and Zulfiqar Khan was rewarded, though his secret support for Rajaram remained covert. ==Aftermath== Mughal accounts state that Zulfikhar Ali Khan renamed Jinji Fort \"Nusratgarh\" after capturing it, though the Maratha leader Rajaram escaped during the siege, much to Zulfikhar's dismay and efforts of Ganoji Shirke and Girjoji Yadav.The Mughal rule in Jinji later contributed to the rise of the Nawab of the Carnatic and the Sultanate of Mysore. However, Hindu accounts credit Swarup Singh of Bundela for aiding the Mughal success at Jinji. In 1700, Emperor Aurangzeb appointed him Mansabdar of 2,500 and gave him command of the fort. After Swarup Singh's death in 1714, his son De Singh took over under a Firman from Emperor Jahandar Shah. This move angered Muhammed Saadatullah Khan I, who marched to Jinji, killed De Singh, and declared himself the fort's administrator. == References == Category:India",
