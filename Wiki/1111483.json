 "text": "Exudate is fluid that leaks out of blood vessels into nearby tissues. Exudates usually have higher protein concentration and LD activity and lower pH and glucose than transudates. The protein concentration of an exudate is usually higher than 3 g/dL. Exudate LD activity is > (more) than 0.67 times the upper limit of normal for serum. This means if the pleural fluid protein is > (more) than 35g/L the fluid is an exudate. Exudate is usually bad-smelling Pus. At the same time, total protein is normal and the pleural fluid protein is < (less) than 25g/L (2.5 g/dL) the fluid is a transudate. The appearance is used in diagnosing the liquid when it comes out before testing. == Related pages == * Immune system * Glucose * Chemistry == References == Category:Physiology",
