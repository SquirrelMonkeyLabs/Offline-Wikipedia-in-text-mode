Lisa (Yeardley Smith) starts a campaign with a new boy named Colin (Tress MacNeille), who is Irish. They want to stop the people of Springfield from dumping in the lake. Everyone agrees to this and the lake is cleared up. Marge (Julie Kavner) questions Homer about Spider pigs 'leavings'. He says he has put them in a silo. This causes Marge to say \"Get rid of the silo properly.\" Homer agrees to this, and Marge says he is allowed to take Spider Pig with him. To which Homer tells Marge \"He's not Spider Pig anymore, he's Harry Plopper\". This is based on Harry Potter. The pig even has the lightning bolt scar and the thick glasses, just like Harry Potter. Homer drives to the waste site to get rid of the silo. Homer's friend and co-worker Lenny (Harry Shearer) calls him from a donut store and tells him that they are giving out free donuts.
