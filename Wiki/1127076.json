After the Insurrection of 10 August 1792, the monarchy was suspended and later abolished by the Legislative Assembly.Fraser, 454 == Background == From 1789, France had a revolution against monarchy in the government. At the time, a idea of a fair and liberal constitution became more and more popular with the French people, and to the National Assembly.Hibbert, 63 Louis XVI moved to Paris that year, but grew to hate it, planning the Flight to Varennes, which ruined the monarchy's already bad public opinion to be worse.Hibbert, 130 == Constitution == After the Flight, Louis XVI was forced to submit to the constitution by the National Assembly.Jones, 426 The new constitution was revolutionary and abolished the nobility of France and said all men were to be treated the same before the law. !bgcolor=\"#000000\" colspan=\"6\"| |- |- |- |- |- ==See also== * Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly == Citations == == References == *Fraser, Antonia: \"Marie Antoinette: the Journey\", Orion Books, London, 2001, *Hibbert, Christopher: \"The French Revolution\", Penguin Books, Great Britain, 1982, *Jones, Colin: \"The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon\", Columbia University Press, New York, 2002, Category:French Revolution Category:1790s in France Category:1791 Category:1792",
