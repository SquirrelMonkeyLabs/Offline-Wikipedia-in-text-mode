 "text": "The Sapa bush frog (Gracixalus sapaensis) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam. Scientists think it could live in China too. People have seen it between 1250 and 2362 meters above sea level. This frog lives in the Fan Si Pan mountains, in forests and in places with smaller plants. People sometimes see it on farms. The frog sits on plants about 2 m above the ground. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Hoang Lien Son National Park. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to build farms and things for visitors. Climate change may kill this frog. Because it lives high on mountains, it cannot move north to colder places if the area becomes hotter. It would have to climb down the mountain to warmer places first. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Gracixalus carinensis, but in 2017, they decided they were two different species of frog. Scientists named this frog \"Sa Pa\" after the place where it lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
