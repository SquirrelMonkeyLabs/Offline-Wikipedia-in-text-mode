 "text": "The FIFA Women's World Cup is a football tournament for women's national teams from countries that are part of FIFA. It happens every four years, one year after the men's World Cup. The first one was in China in 1991. Teams compete for 31 spots through qualifications, and the host country gets the 32nd spot. The tournament, called the World Cup Finals, takes place in the host country over about a month. Five different countries have won the nine Women's World Cup tournaments. The United States won four times, Germany twice, and Japan, Norway, and Spain once each. Eight countries have hosted the Women's World Cup, including China and the United States twice. Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, and Sweden have each hosted it once. In 2023, Australia and New Zealand co-hosted the tournament, marking the first time it was in the Southern Hemisphere, the first Women's World Cup hosted by two countries, and the first FIFA competition to span two confederations. == Champions and top four finish == Team Title(s) Runners-up Third place Fourth place Top 4 total 4 (1991, 1999*, 2015, 2019) 1 (2011) 3 (1995, 2003*, 2007) 8 2 (2003, 2007) 1 (1995) 2 (1991, 2015) 5 1 (1995) 1 (1991) 2 (1999, 2007) 4 1 (2011) 1 (2015) 2 1 (2023) 1 1 (2003) 4 (1991, 2011, 2019, 2023) 5 1 (2023) 1 (2015) 1 (2019) 3 1 (2007) 1 (1999) 2 1 (1999) 1 (1995) 2 1 (2019) 1 1 (2003) 1 1 (2011) 1 1 (2023*) 1 : * host nation Category:1991 establishments",
