 "text": "LittleBigPlanet, also known as 'LBP', is a series of puzzle platformer video games. The first game was only made for PlayStation 3, and it was first made known on 7 March 2007, by Phil Harrison at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco, California. It was made under the title 'The Next Big Thing' by Media Molecule and was published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. The game got good ratings from critics. They liked its presentation, including its graphics, physics and sound, together with its gameplay and the ability to change a lot of things, as well as online features. More praise was given to its size and future potential based on levels made by players. Small criticism was made for some parts of the gameplay and level-making tools. LittleBigPlanet has won a large amount of awards. == Overview == In LittleBigPlanet, you control a character called a \"Sackperson\". The Sackperson can walk, run, jump, and grab some objects in the game. Your Sackperson can wear many kinds of outfits, which are shown in the Popit Menu, a menu that opens upon pressing the Square button. The Popit Menu also has items called Stickers and Decorations, which are pictures that can be placed in any part the game. The game is played in Story Mode, which is a set of levels split across eight themes based on places in the world. The player must use their Sackperson's powers, and the objects in the levels, to solve puzzles and reach the end of the levels. Throughout levels, there are \"Prize Bubbles\" that give the player new outfits, stickers, decorations, and other objects to use from the Popit Menu. Another part of LittleBigPlanet is My Moon, which lets players use the objects they found in Story Mode to make their own levels. Players can post their levels online, so that other players can play them. Players can post comments in a page for another player's level. LittleBigPlanet has many sets of downloadable content, which can give players more outfits, stickers, decorations, objects, and tools. Some downloaded kits have new levels to play, which have even more prizes for players to get. These prizes can also be used to make levels. ==List of games== * LittleBigPlanet * LittleBigPlanet (PSP) * LittleBigPlanet 2 * LittleBigPlanet PS Vita * LittleBigPlanet Karting * LittleBigPlanet 3 * Sackboy: A Big Adventure",
