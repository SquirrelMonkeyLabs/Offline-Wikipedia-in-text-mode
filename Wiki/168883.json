Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly.A symbol is an object, action, or idea that represents something other than itself, often of a more abstract nature. In literature, the style started with the publication Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil, 1857) by Charles Baudelaire. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence; It was also the source of many tropes and images.Trope: figure of speech, device, theme.
