However, it has been argued that it should be replaced by a term like \"Brilliant Diamond\", to include the University of Manchester.as Brilliant Diamond or Diamond of England The figures below suggest that both the universities of Manchester and Edinburgh belong in the same class, and might better reflect the geographical spectrum of the UK higher education. Oxford, Cambridge and some of the London institutions collaborate in research.
