 "text": "The digital television transition (also called the digital switchover (DSO), the analog switch-off (ASO), the digital migration, or the analog shutdown) is the process in which older analogue television broadcasting technology is converted to and replaced by digital television. Conducted by individual nations on different schedules, this primarily involves the conversion of analogue terrestrial television broadcasting infrastructure to digital terrestrial (DTT), a major benefit being extra frequencies on the radio spectrum and lower broadcasting costs, as well as improved viewing qualities for consumers. ==References== Category:Television",
