 "text": "Pedro José Domingo de la Calzada Manuel María Lascuráin Paredes (8 May 1856 – 21 July 1952) was a Mexican politician. He served as the 38th President of Mexico. He served as president for less than one hour on February 19, 1913. It is the shortest presidency in the history of the world. He had earlier served as Mexico's foreign minister for two terms and was the director of a small law school in Mexico City for sixteen years. ==Early life== Lascuráin was born in Mexico City, Mexico. ==Presidency== Before becoming president, Lascuráin was mayor of Mexico City. On 19 February 1913, General Victoriano Huerta overthrew President Madero. Lascuráin was one of the people who convinced Madero to resign the presidency while he was being held prisoner in the National Palace. He claimed that his life was in danger if he refused. Under the Constitution of Mexico, the vice-president, the attorney general, the foreign minister and then the interior minister stood next in line to the presidency. As well as Madero, Huerta had overthrown Vice-President José María Pino Suárez and Attorney General Adolfo Valles Baca. Lascuráin, as foreign minister, assumed the presidency. Lascuráin was president for less than an hour; sources quote figures ranging from 15 to 56 minutes. To date, Lascuráin's presidency is the shortest in history, even briefer than that of Venezuelan politician Diosdado Cabello in 2002. ==Death== Lascuráin died in Mexico City from natural causes, aged 96 years old. ==References== ==Other websites== * La decena trágica by Alejandro Rosas * La decena trágica * Brief biography at Encarta * Brief biography * A little more biographical information Category:1856 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Presidents of Mexico Category:Mexican mayors Category:Politicians from Mexico City Category:20th-century presidents of Mexico",
