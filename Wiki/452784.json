They find love with Mary Llewellyn, whom they meet while serving as an ambulance driver in World War I. Their happiness together is spoilt by social isolation and rejection. The novel portrays \"inversion\" (homosexuality) and androgyny as a natural, God-given state and makes a plea: \"Give us also the right to our existence\". ==References== Category:1928 works Category:English novels Category:LGBT in the United Kingdom Category:1920s books",
