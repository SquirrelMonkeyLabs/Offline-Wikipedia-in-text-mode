He was a major newsreader and reporter who covered many royal events including weddings and funerals. He also announced the death of Elizabeth II. In July 2023, The Sun reported that a 'well-known BBC presenter' had paid a teenager Â£35,000 for explicit photographs. Edwards was one of the main presenters who was accused of this. His wife said that he is suffering from depression due to this. The Metropolitan Police did not find any evidence of crime. Since, he was been suspended in July 2023. In July 2024, Edwards pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children. He also used to do BBC News at 10. == Sources == Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh journalists",
