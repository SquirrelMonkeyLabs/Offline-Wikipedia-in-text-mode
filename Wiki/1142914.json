 "text": "Las Orquídeas National Natural Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Natural Las Orquídeas or PNN Las Orquídeas) is a national park in the Cordillera Occidental (west ridge mountains) in Colombia. It became a park in 1974. It is in size. The park is high in the hills, from 300–3,450 m above sea level. The air has water in it, and about 3,000-4,000 mm of rain falls every year. Higher up in the mountains, only 2,500 mm of rain falls every year. In the lower parts of the park, there are tropical places. Higher up in the mountains, there are alpine places. Because the different parts of the park are so different from each other, many species of living things live there. In the lowland rainforest (ca. 300–1,000 m), premontane forest (ca. 1,000–2,000 m), montane forest (ca. 2,000–3,200 m), and high-elevation páramo grassland (ca. 3,200–3,450 m).Flora of Las Orquídeas National Park.
