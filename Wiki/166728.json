 "text": "Postman Pat is a British children's television series created by John Cunliffe. It starred and was narrated by Ken Barrie. It is aimed at pre-school children, and concerns the adventures of Pat Clifton, a postman in the fictional village of Greendale (inspired by the real valley of Longsleddale near Kendal). ==Plot== Postmen generally bring letters and parcels. Postman Pat brings another portion of good humour into the house. Because Pat is the friendliest postman the small English town of Greendale could wish for. Every day he delivers a heavy load of cards, letters, parcels and express postings. And kitten Jess is always at his side. Meanwhile, the conscientious Mrs. Goggins runs the post office, which in Greendale is a meeting place for the residents, such as the clever Ted Glen, Father Timms, the twins Katy and Tom or farmer Alf Thompson. There is no question that Pat's family, wife Sarah and son Julian, also make a detour to the post office from time to time. Everyone knows everyone in Greendale. And when there is news, they are, where else, in the best hands with Pat and Mrs. Goggins. ==Cancellation and spin-off== The original series was cancelled by the BBC. Later on, it was announced that the spin-off is announced. BBC announced that the spin-off would be titled as Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service. ==References== Category:BBC Television programmes Category:1980s British television series Category:1981 British television series debuts Category:1990s British television series Category:1990s children's television series Category:2000s British television series Category:2000s children's television series Category:2010s British television series Category:2010s children's television series Category:English-language television programs Category:1980s children's television series Category:CBeebies",
