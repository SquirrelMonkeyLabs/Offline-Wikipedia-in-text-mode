 "text": "The Manila Light Rail Transit System, commonly known as the LRT, is an urban rail transit system that primarily serves Metro Manila, Philippines. Although categorized as a light rail system because it originally used light rail vehicles, it presently has characteristics of a rapid transit system, such as high passenger throughput, exclusive right-of-way, and later use of full metro rolling stock. The LRT's is mostly elevated and consists of two lines and 38 stations. LRT Line 1, also called the Green Line (formerly, Yellow Line), opened in 1984 and travels a north–south route. LRT Line 2, the Blue Line (formerly, Purple Line), was completed in 2004 and runs east–west. The original Line 1 was built as a no-frills means of public transport, but the newer Line 2 was built with conveniences like barrier-free access (disability ergonomics). In 2022, the system served 305,264 passengers on average. ==Administration== The LRT is jointly-operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA), a government corporation attached to the Philippine Department of Transportation (DOTr), and a rail service company, Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC). Along with the Manila Metro Rail Transit System and the Philippine National Railways, the system makes up Metro Manila's rail infrastructure. Security facilities at each station conduct safety inspections and provide assistance. A reusable plastic magnetic ticketing system has replaced the previous token-based system in 2001, and the \"Flash Pass\" was introduced as a step towards a more integrated transportation system. In 2015, the plastic magnetic tickets were replaced with the Beep (smart card), a contactless smart card, introduced to provide common ticketing to 3 rail lines and selected bus lines. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Rail transport in Metro Manila",
