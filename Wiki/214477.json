She is best known for her portrayal of Anne Boleyn in the 1969 movie Anne of the Thousand Days. ==Life and career== Bujold was born in Montreal, Quebec, into a Catholic French Canadian working-class family. She received a strict convent education for twelve years. After that, she entered Montreal's Conservatoire d'art dramatique. There she was trained in the great classics of French theatre. She made her stage debut as Rosine in Beaumarchais' Le Barbier de Séville in 1962. Bujold got her first major break in 1965, while on a theatrical tour in Paris. She was noticed by French director Alain Resnais, who offered her a role in his movie La guerre est finie, opposite Yves Montand. This led to her staying in France for a time. There she appeared in two other movies: Philippe de Broca's Le Roi de Coeur, opposite Alan Bates, and Louis Malle's Le voleur, opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo. Back in Canada, Bujold married screenwriter/director/producer Paul Almond in 1967. She starred in three of his movies; Isabel (1968), The Act of the Heart (1970) and Journey (1972). She won the Canadian Film Award for best actress for the first two. The couple divorced in 1973, but worked again together in Final Assignment (1980) and The Dance Goes On (1991). The latter also featured their son Mathew Almond (born in 1968). Bujold appeared in Michel Brault's Entre la mer et l'eau douce (1967). She appeared in Claude Jutra's Kamouraska (1973), and won her third Canadian Film Award for best actress for that role. Bujold made notable appearances on American television (Hallmark Hall of Fame, NBC) in George Bernard Shaw's classic plays; Saint Joan in 1967, and Caesar and Cleopatra in 1976, the later opposite Sir Alec Guinness. She also appeared in Jean Anouilh's Antigone in 1974 (Great Performances, PBS). International recognition came in 1969, when Bujold portrayed Anne Boleyn in Charles Jarrott's movie Anne of the Thousand Days, opposite Richard Burton's Henry VIII. Her performance won her the Golden Globe Award for best actress in a leading role and an Academy Award nomination in the same category.
