 "text": "Solubility is the ability of a substance (the solute), to mix into a liquid (the solvent).Atkins' Physical Chemistry, 7th Ed. by Julio De Paula, P.W. Atkins It measures the highest amount of substance mixed into a liquid solvent while they are both at equal amounts. When the two mix together it is called a saturated solution. Certain substances can mix into any amount of a liquid solvent. An example of this is ethanol in water. This process is better described as \"miscible\" (the ability to mix with one another). Solubility does not depend on the size, in fact even the large particles will eventually all dissolve. A solute is a substance that is dissolving in a solvent and is the smaller part of the solution. A solvent is the bigger part of a solution and is the substance that the solute dissolves in. This may be presented in different ways such as a solubility curve, usually used to tell whether a substance is saturated or unsaturated. == Other websites == * ALOGPS interactive calculation of aqueous solubility of compounds at Virtual Computational Chemistry Laboratory using several algorithms * QUANTUM web based calculation of aqueous and DMSO solubility of compounds QUANTUM web based prediction of aqueous and DMSO solubility of compounds * ACD/Solubility DB aqueous solubility prediction == References == Category:Chemistry Category:Physical properties",
