 "text": "Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, notes, copyrights and patents. == History == The idea behind all property law is property. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch. Land ownership was through land tenure in feudal systems. The first legal right of absolute ownership was under Roman law and was called dominion. The Napoleonic Code was among the first government acts of modern times to introduce the notion of absolute ownership into statute. But protection of personal property rights was present in medieval Islamic law.John G. Sprankling, The International Law of Property (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 241 == References == Category:Property law",
