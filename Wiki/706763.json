 "text": "The M1919 Browning machine gun was a .30-06 Springfield light machine gun that mostly replaced the M1917 during World War II. It was one of the earliest air- cooled machine guns. It overheated more quickly than the M1917, which was water-cooled, but it was much lighter. It fired slowly enough so that a soldier who was well-trained in shooting in bursts would not overheat the gun. The M1919 was well-known for being powerful, accurate, and reliable.
