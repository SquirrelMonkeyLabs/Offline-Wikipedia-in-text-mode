They are found in forests and woodlands, especially in humid highlands. These birds live in the Americas. The word \"quetzal\" was first used for the resplendent quetzal, a famous long-tailed quetzal that lives in Central America. The resplendent quetzal is the national symbol of Guatemala. They are strongly sexually dimorphic, as usual with the males being brighter. Parts of the female plumageis brown or grey. These largely solitary birds feed on fruits, berries, insects and small vertebrates (such as frogs). Even with their famous bright plumage, they can be hard to see in their natural wooded habitats. In Aztec times, the quetzal was worshiped as the god of the air. Its long tail feathers, which can grow up to 2 ft (60 cm) long, were highly prized for making into costume and head-dresses. == Species == Resplendent Quetzal Pavonine Quetzal Crested Quetzal Eared Quetzal White-Tipped Quetzal Golden Headed Quetzal == References == Category:Trogoniformes Category:National symbols of Guatemala",
