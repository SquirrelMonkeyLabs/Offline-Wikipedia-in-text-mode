After 560 CE, they established \"principalities\" in the area of Tokharistan, under the suzerainty of the Western Turkic Khaganate (Traditional Chinese: 西突厥汗國) – north of the Oxus – and of the Sassanid Empire – in the areas south of the Oxus – before the Tokhara Yabghus took over the region in 625 CE. ==Related pages== * Sogdia * Scythia * Tocharians * Tang Dynasty * Sassanid Empire * Indo-Iranian peoples * Indo-Iranian languages ==References== Category:5th-century establishments in Asia",
