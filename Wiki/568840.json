 "text": "Moshe Gershuni (11 September 1936 - 22 January 2017) was an Israeli painter and sculptor. He was born in Tel Aviv. He was known for his paintings in the 1980s which recognised The Holocaust. In 2003, he was awarded the Israel Prize for his paintings. However, Gershuni wanted to get the award without going to the event. Because of this, his Israel Prize was not given to him. Gershuni died on 22 January 2017 in Tel Aviv at the age of 80. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli painters Category:Israeli sculptors Category:Jewish artists Category:People from Tel Aviv",
