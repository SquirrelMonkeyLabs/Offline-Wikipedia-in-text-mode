Discovery EMEA for localisation strategy for international markets (such as the UK) and in conjunction with Warner Bros. Television Studios UK for the production of content and global leadership of the Cartoon Network brand.The channel primarily airs animated programming. The channel initially launched on 17 September 1993 as a larger pan-European feed, serving the UK market along with Western and Northern Europe. In August 1999, the pan-European aspect of Cartoon Network Europe was spun-off as a new feed with an identical schedule to Cartoon Network UK (the former pan-European feed). Cartoon Network UK completely ceased being a pan-European feed on 15 October 1999 which was when it was scrambled with Videocrypt and the launch of the UK only version of TNT. The pan-European feed continued to shadow Cartoon Network UK's schedule until 2001. The pan-European feed excluded shows such as Dragon Ball Z and Angela Anaconda and were substituted, as Cartoon Network did not have the pan-European broadcasting rights to these shows, only the rights for the UK and the Netherlands. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official pan-European Feed Site * Other official pan-European Feed Site * Official UK Site Category:Cartoon Network Category:1993 establishments in Europe Category:British television channels",
