Daniel finds out that the reason that Mr. Miyagi left Japan was because his old friend Sato wanted to kill Mr. Miyagi for falling in love with a girl named Yukie who had an arranged marriage to Sato. Daniel falls in love with a Japanese girl named Komiko but is harassed by Sato’s nephew Chozen. When a hurricane comes Daniel rescues a little girl and Mr. Miyagi rescues Sato. Sato then helps them save everyone else there. Chozen is angry with Sato for having helped their enemies so he kidnaps Komiko and says he won’t let her go unless Daniel fights him to the death. Daniel fights Chozen and wins but doesn’t kill him because he remembers that when Mr. Miyagi won his fight against John Kreese Miyagi didn’t kill him and told Daniel that “when a man has no forgiveness in his heart, life is greater punishment than death.
