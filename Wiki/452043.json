Despite his parents decisions the young Luis abandoned his religious rank due to a lack of interest in his charges on 18 December 1754. He was given the title of Count of Chinchón by which he is known. The title was eventually inherited by his daughter Maria Teresa and was given to him by his older brother The Infante Felipe.
