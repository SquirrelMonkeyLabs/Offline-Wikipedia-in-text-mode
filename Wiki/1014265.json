 "text": "The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is a Jewish international organization headquartered in New York City. The ADL fights against antisemitism, racism and all types of bigotry. It was founded in late September 1913 by the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish service organization, in the wake of the contentious murder conviction of Leo Frank. ADL subsequently split from B'nai B'rith and continued as an independent US section 501(c)(3) nonprofit. In an early campaign, ADL and allied groups pressured the automaker Henry Ford, who had published virulently antisemitic propaganda.Blakeslee, Spencer (2000).The Death of American Antisemitism. Praeger/Greenwood. , p. 83. In the 1930s, ADL worked with the American Jewish Committee (AJC) to oppose pro-Nazi activity in the United States. It opposed McCarthyism during the Cold War, and campaigned for major civil rights legislation in the 1960s. It also worked with the NAACP to discredit the far right in a spy operation. In the 1980s, it was involved in propaganda against Nelson Mandela of South Africa before embracing him the following decade. Since the 1970s, ADL has advanced the concept of new antisemitism, including a definition that says anti-Zionism and some criticisms of Israel are antisemitic. It has received criticism, including from members of its staff, that such advocacy has diverted ADL from its historical fight against antisemitism. ==References== == Other websites == Category:Politics Category:Civil rights Category:Human rights Category:United States Category:International organizations Category:Non-governmental organizations Category:Organizations based in New York City Category:1913 establishments in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States",
