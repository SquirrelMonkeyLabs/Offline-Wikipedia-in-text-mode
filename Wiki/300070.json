Only a small number of people get sick enough to go to a hospital. There is also no specific treatment for HFMD. It goes away on its own in about 7 to 10 days. == Asia == Over the last decade, many outbreaks of HFMD have been reported in countries of the Western Pacific Region. Recently, countries with large increases in the number of reported cases in Asia have included China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, HFMD circulates year-round in most provinces with two associated peaks, from March to May and from September to December. ==References== Category:Diseases caused by viruses",
