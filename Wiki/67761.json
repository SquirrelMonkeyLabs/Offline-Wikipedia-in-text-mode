 "text": "Wind shear is a difference in either wind speed or direction over a fairly short distance in the atmosphere. Wind shear can be divided into two different types: horizontal and vertical wind shear. ==When wind shear is observed== Weather situations when the Wind shear is observed happen: *At weather fronts when the temperature difference across the front is 5 °C or more, and the front moves at 15 kt or faster. *At low level jets when a significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level jet. *At mountains when winds blow over and create vertical shear on the lee side.National Center for Atmospheric Research.
