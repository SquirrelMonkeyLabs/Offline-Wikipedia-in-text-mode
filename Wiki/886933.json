 "text": "Italo Giordani (1882 - 1956) was an Italian artist, a painter, who was active in France. Italo Giordani moved to Naples to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples. Later he studied first in Venice and then, from 1908 to 1909, in Milan, with Cesare Cesare Tallone as Master, finding success in France in 1917, and then with his exhibitions in Paris. He reached Lake Como and the locality of Lierna as a guest of some families of the European nobility on holiday. He devoted himself to the outdoor painting of landscapes and glimpses. But he also painted views of Venice, Martigues and Cannes, Amalfi and Posillipo, places intoxicated with light, and as he himself says \"sung by poets, and visited by him in happy moments\". He painted above all landscapes, with the lakes of Como often inserted in countryside scenes. His artworks are characterized by polychromy and brightness. == Bibliography == * \"Il secolo 20. rivista popolare illustrata\", p. 799, 1920 * Rassegna d'arte antica e moderna, p. 21, 1920 * Italo Giordani, Haldane Macfall, Catalogue of Paintings by Italo Giordani, pubblisher United Arts Gallery (London, England), 1922 * Revue de l'Am√©rique latine, Volume 14, p. 96, pubblisher, Ernest Martinenche, 1927 * Revue belge, vol. 3, 1928 Category:1882 births Category:1956 deaths Category:20th-century Italian painters",
