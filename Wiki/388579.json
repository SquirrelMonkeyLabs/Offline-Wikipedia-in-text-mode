 "text": "Daylily is the common name of a Hemerocallis.Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 Daylily flowers can have different colors and shapes. The flowers are popular around gardener groups because they are easy to grow and can be easily mutated. The name Hemerocallis comes from the Greek words ἡμέρα (hēmera) \"day\" and καλός (kalos) \"beautiful\". The name suggest that this flower will bloom only for one day, as in H. fulva, also called ditch lily. The flowers of some daylilies can be eaten and are used in the Chinese kitchen. They are sold in Asian markets as gum jum or golden needles (金针 in Chinese; pinyin: jīnzhēn) or yellow flower vegetables (黃花菜 in Chinese; pinyin: huánghuācài). ==References== Category:Asparagales Category:Flowers",
