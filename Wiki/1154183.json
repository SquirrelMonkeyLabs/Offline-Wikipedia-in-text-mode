 "text": "Crazyhouse is a chess variant that captured enemy pieces can be returned, or dropped into the game as their own. It was made from a two-player and a single-board variant game from bughouse chess. The drop rule is similar to shogi, but pawns can be placed on same columns and pawns can give an immediate checkmate to their enemy's king. Pawns may not be placed on their first or eighth rows, but other pieces can be placed on any empty square on the board. ==Related pages== *Bughouse chess *Shogi *Chess Category:Chess variants Category:Chess",
