 "text": "The West Bank is a territory in Palestine in the Middle East. The State of Palestine claims the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. However, Israel and some other nations disagree that the West Bank is Israeli territory. The West Bank has been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Since 1990, the Israeli government and the Palestinians have had many talks about what will happen in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the future. Most people on the West Bank are Palestinians, but there are also many Jewish settlers in settlements. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under international law. == Geography == The West Bank borders Israel to the west and Jordan to the east. It touches the Dead Sea and the River Jordan. Hills or desert make up most of its landscape. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are cooler and rainy. == Regions == The West Bank is divided into 165 Palestinian enclaves that are under partial Palestinian rule. The rest of the West Bank, including 200 Israeli settlements, is under full Israeli control.Israel's control of the airspace and the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip . == Laws == Israeli settlers and civilians living in the West Bank (or traveling through it) are subject to Israeli law, and are represented in the Knesset. On the other hand, Palestinian civilians (who are mostly stuck in or confined to scattered enclaves), are subject to martial law and are not permitted to vote in Israel's national elections. == Names == The occupied West Bank is called \"Judea and Samaria\" by the Israeli government, some Jews, and Christian Zionists (en).{{}} == Related pages == * Human rights in West Bank * LGBT rights in West Bank * Israeli occupation of the West Bank == Other websites == *IMEMC *Jerusalem Post == Notes == == Sources ==",
