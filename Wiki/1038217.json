 "text": "The 2022 Fijian general election was held on 14 December 2022 to elect the 55 members of the Parliament of Fiji. It was conducted by the Fiji Electoral Commission (FEC) following some electoral changes that the opposition did not like. The 15-year-incumbent centrist FijiFirst government, led by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, tried to win a fourth term in government. The election resulted in a hung parliament. While FijiFirst had a plurality of seats and the highest number of votes, the new centre-right People's Alliance party, led by former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, formed government and Rabuka became the next Prime Minister. The People's Alliance formed a coalition government with the two other parties that won seats: the centre- left National Federation Party (NFP; led by Biman Prasad) and the centre-right Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA; led by Viliame Gavoka). ==References== Category:2022 elections Category:Elections in Fiji",
