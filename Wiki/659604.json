After some time the United States called cartographers to draw up borders for some Territories. What they came up with was the Arizona, Colorado, and Californias (later shortened to California). The Arizona Territory was not added on to until 1853. The Gadsden Purchase happened in 1853. It added onto the previously created Arizona Territory.
