 "text": "The southern walking leaf frog (Phyllomedusa iheringii) is a frog that lives in Brazil and Uruguay. People have seen it 500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in shrub places and in forests with streams in them. It lives in trees. The female frog lays eggs on plants growing over still water. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. The tadpoles swim in the deepest water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. People do catch these frogs to sell as pets, and people do cut down their forests to make places for animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
