 "text": "Louis I of Spain (25 August 1707 – 31 August 1724) was the King of Spain and eldest son of Philip V of Spain and Maria Luisa of Savoy. His reign was one of the shortest in Spanish history. It is often considered unremarkable. However, his marriage to his father's cousin Louis Élisabeth d'Orléans helped the country's relations with France. His wife was a minor French princess. Louis was born in Madrid. He was the heir to the throne from birth. He held the title Prince of Asturias. He was given the names Louis, after his grandfather the King Louis XIV, and Felipe, in honour of his father. He was a first cousin of Louis XV of France as well as the future Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. Louis was King of Spain from 14 January to 31 August 1724, less than eight months. During his short reign he was nicknamed The beloved and The liberal (El Bien Amado and El Liberal in Spanish). His reign ended when he died of smallpox. He had no children. ==Titles and styles== *25 August 1707 – 2 April 1709: His Royal Highness The Infante Don Luis of Spain *2 April 1709 – 14 January 1724: His Royal Highness The Prince of Asturias *14 January 1724 – 31 August 1724: His Majesty The King Category:Spanish House of Bourbon Category:1707 births Category:1724 deaths Category:Deaths from smallpox Category:Princes and Princesses of Asturias Category:Spanish infantes and infantas Category:Spanish monarchs",
