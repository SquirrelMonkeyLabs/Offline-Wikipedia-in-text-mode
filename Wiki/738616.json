 "text": "The Joker Stairs are a set of steep stairs connecting Shakespeare and Anderson Avenues at West 167th Street in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, New York City. It became known as one of the filming locations in the 2019 psychological thriller, Joker. It was used when Arthur was dancing down these stairs while \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" played during the movie's climax. The stairs appear in a promotional poster for the movie and have become a tourist destination. Both the stairs and Arthur's dance have become Internet memes. Many visitors reenact the scene from the movie, sometimes in Joker costume, to the point that the stairs have become crowded with sightseers. Many news articles say that the Joker Stairs have became a popular movie scene such as \"the ranks of well-known movie settings, like that of the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art\" seen in the 1976 American sports drama Rocky. ==References== Category:Internet memes",
