 "text": "Sir William Vallance Douglas Hodge (; 17 June 1903 â€“ 7 July 1975 G) was a geometer. ==Works== He discovered deep topological relations between algebraic and differential geometry. This is an area of harmonics now called Hodge theory. It is used in manifolds. It had big sway in academic geometry for several generations of mathematics education. ==Related pages== *Hodge Conjecture *Hodge's Postulates *Applied geometry ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Scottish mathematicians Category:British geometers Category:Scientists from Edinburgh Category:Algebraic geometers",
