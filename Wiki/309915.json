 "text": "Factoid is stating a fact that is not backed up by evidence. The factoid may not be trusted because :(a) it is actually false, or :(b) because evidence to support it cannot be checked. Factoids become widely treated as if they were true.Pratkanis, Anthony R. (2001). Age of Propaganda: the Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion, p. 104. In 1973, the term factoid was created and first used by Norman Mailer.Winslow, Donald J. (1995). Life-writing: a Glossary of Terms in Biography, Autobiography, and Related Forms, p. 24; citing Mailer, Norman. (1973). Marilyn: A Biography, p. 63. A factoid is \"an item of unreliable information which is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as a fact\".Simpson, J.A. et al. (2008). The Compact Oxford English Dictionary. The most important thing is that the factoid is widely believed.Rollyson, Carl Edmund. (1993). Marilyn Monroe: a life of the actress, p. 36; excerpt, \"the most mysterious property of a factoid [a fiction that masquerades or functions as a fact] is that it is believed by the people who put together the factoid next to it.\" A factoid refers to something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact.Pruden, Wesley. \"The Fearsome Reality of the Surreal,\" Jewish World Review (US). July 15, 2003. The term can also be used to describe partial information without context. ==References== Category:Philosophy",
