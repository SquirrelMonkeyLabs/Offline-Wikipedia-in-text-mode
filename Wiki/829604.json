 "text": "Llandudno railway station () is a train station in Llandudno in Conwy County Borough, North Wales. It is managed by Transport for Wales and opened in 1858. It is on a branch of the North Wales Coast Line that runs between Holyhead in Anglesey and Crewe in Cheshire, England. The station still has some of its old architecture and has a 1800s style canopy. In 2013, part of it was reconstructed in a scheme that cost Â£5.2 million. Even though part of the station was reconstructed, most of its old architecture still stands. The station is very popular with tourists and is mainly used by them. ==Services== Transport for Wales run a train every hour to Manchester Piccadilly via Chester. Two of these trains a day go to Crewe instead of Manchester. Transport for Wales also run one shuttle train an hour between Llandudno and Llandudno Junction.
