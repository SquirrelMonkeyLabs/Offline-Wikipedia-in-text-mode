 "text": "A credit card is a type of card that allows buying items without cash. Credit cards tend to be small plastic cards with a unique number attached to a bank account. Most are magnetic stripe cards. Many have an EMV chip for use by card readers. Paying with a credit card means borrowing the money, which must be repaid in a specified time. Users failing to repay in time may have to pay much more. ==Features== Each card has a unique number. Using this number, plus other details on the card, such as the validity date, or a code, the client can buy goods or services. The issuer of the card automatically transfers the money to the seller. The person using the card gets a credit. The customer has a certain amount of time to pay the credit card bill. ==Interest== If the bill is left unpaid for some time, the customer will have to pay interest for the amount that is left unpaid. Payment using a credit card is one of the most common methods of electronic payment. A debit card similarly allows paying without cash, but it pays with money in the user's bank account.
