The museum opened in 2003, showing the growth of jobs in Minneapolis including flour milling and hydropower from Saint Anthony Falls. The museum has a water lab and baking lab. == Flour Tower == The flour tower is the main attraction of the Mill City Museum. Visitors sit in a elevator and are brought to different floors of the building. The floors are designed to look like a fully operational flour mill. Visitors also hear voice recordings of people who worked at the mill. == Washburn A Mill == The original Washburn A Mill was built in 1874. It was the largest flour mill in the world. On May 2, 1878, the mill exploded due to flour dust. It was known as the Great Mill Disaster. It killed 17 people and destroyed five other mills. In 1880, a new Washburn Mill was created as the largest flour mill in the world. The mill could make two millions pounds of flour per day.The mill became a National Historic Landmark in 1983 In 1991, a fire nearly destroyed the old mill. The mill had a good sprinkler system that would have ended the fire. The sprinklers were not on because no one was in the building. The building was turned into a museum by the City of Minneapolis in 2001. == Photos == File:Washburnamill.jpg|Recreation of the Great Mill Disaster File:MillCityRailcar.jpg|A boxcar showing how the goods were transferred File:MillCityMillstone.jpg|A millstone used in flour milling File:MillCityRollerMill.jpg|Equipment used in roller milling == References == == Other websites == * * Mill City History Portal Category:History of Minneapolis Category:Pages using gadget WikiMiniAtlas Category:Infobox mapframe without OSM relation ID on Wikidata Category:Museums in the United States Category:2003 establishments in the United States",
