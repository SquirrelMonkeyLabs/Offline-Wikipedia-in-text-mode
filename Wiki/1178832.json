 "text": "The whitebelly rocket frog or white-dotted rocket frog (Aromobates alboguttatus) is a frog. It lives in Trinidad. ==Home== The adult frogs live in clear streams in cloud forests in the Andes mountains. Scientists saw the frog between 1600 and 3090 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in protected parks, Sierra Nevada National Park and Sierra de la Culata National Park. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on land. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places for people to raise animals. Scientists believe the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis could give the frogs the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. They also think climate change and ultraviolet light could hurt the frogs, eggs, and tadpoles. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
