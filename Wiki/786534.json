It has 44 member countries, mostly located on the Asian continent, but excludes the transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia – Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation and Turkey – which are instead members of European Handball Federation (EHF). Three other states located along the western fringe of Asia – Cyprus, Armenia and Israel – are also EHF members. Hong Kong China and Macau, although not independent countries (both are Special regions of China), are also members of the AHF. One of IHF's six continental confederations, the AHF was formed officially on 26 August 1974 in Tehran (Imperial State of Iran), on the sidelines of the 7th Asian Games 1974. The AHF headquarters is located in Kuwait City (Kuwait). Its current President is Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah from Kuwait who is a member of House of Sabah, the ruling family of Kuwait. ==Tournaments== ===AHF=== * Asian Men's Handball Championship * Asian Women's Handball Championship * Asian Men's Junior Handball Championship * Asian Women's Junior Handball Championship * Asian Men's Youth Handball Championship * Asian Women's Youth Handball Championship * Asian Games * Asian Youth Games ===Club=== * Asian Club League Handball Championship * Asian Women's Club League Handball Championship ===Beach=== * Asian Beach Handball Championship * Asian Youth Beach Handball Championship * Asian Beach Games ===Zones=== West Asia * West Asian Women's Handball Championship * West Asian Games South Asia * South Asian Men's Handball Championship * South Asian Women's Handball Championship * South Asian Games Southeast Asia * Southeast Asian Games East Asia * East Asian Games ==Other websites== * Handball Category:Handball in Asia Category:1974 establishments in Asia Category:Handball organizations",
