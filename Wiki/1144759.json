 "text": "The stole is a long, narrow piece of cloth worn by deacons, priests, and bishops in Christian ceremonies. It is about 80 inches long and between 2 and 4 inches wide. Usually, the stole has crosses sewn onto it. == Use == The stole is worn differently by each rank: * Priests wear it around the neck with both ends hanging down in front. * Deacons wear it over their left shoulder, with the ends crossing their chest and back. * Bishops wear it in the same way as priests. The stole is a special symbol of office. Priests and deacons are given their stoles at ordination ceremonies, where the bishop blesses them. The colors of the stole change according to the liturgical calendar. For example, purple is worn during Advent and Lent, white during Christmas and Easter and green during Ordinary Time. == History == The stole was first used in the Eastern Church by the 4th century. In the West, it became more common in the 6th century. Early stoles were simple and narrow, often decorated with tassels. In the 9th century, priests were expected to wear the stole as a sign of their office. Over the centuries, the stole became wider and more decorated. == Related pages == * Chasuble * Fanon * Pallium == References == Category:Christian clothing Category:Liturgical clothing",
