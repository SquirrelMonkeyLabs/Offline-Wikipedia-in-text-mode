 "text": "A bansuri is an ancient side blown flute. It comes from India and Nepal. The flute is an aerophone created from bamboo and a material similar to metal. It is used in many nepali songs. A bansuri is traditionally made from a single piece of bamboo. The piece is hollow and has seven finger holes. Modern bansuri can be made with ivory, fiberglass and different metals. A bansuri with six holes cab play two and a half octaves of music. The flute is normally between in length. It is about as thick as a person's thumb. One end of the flute is closed. The blowhole is a few centimeters from the closed end. Longer bansuris play deeper tones and lower pitches. The early designs have no mechanical keys. The musician makes the notes they want by covering and uncovering finger holes. The bansuri-like flute is seen in paintings in very old Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temples. They are common in the iconography of the Hindu god Krishna. The bansuri is the divine instrument of Lord Krishna. The instrument is also common among other traditions such as Shaivism. ==References== Category:Flutes Category:Indian music Category:Nepali culture",
