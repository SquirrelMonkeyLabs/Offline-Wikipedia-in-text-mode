 "text": "\"Psychosocial\" is the second single and fourth track from Slipknot's fourth studio album, All Hope Is Gone, which was released August 26, 2008. ==Music video== The music video for \"Psychosocial\" was shot at Sound Farm studios in Jamaica, Iowa on June 30, 2008. The shoot was delayed due to an unrelated head injury sustained by turntablist Sid Wilson before the shoot, who was subsequently hospitalized. On July 18, 2008 the video premiered on MTV's FNMTV show, hosted by Pete Wentz. The video, which was directed by Paul Brown, was shot using high-end cameras which shoot 1,000 frames per second and are contrasted with traditional 35 mm hand crank camera equipment. Percussionist Shawn Crahan explains; \"we have the most extreme on both ends, with nothing in the middle. That's what the video is, and nobody does that. There's an art form behind it.\" During an interview with Kerrang!, guitarist James Root revealed that the video features the burning of the purgatory masks adorned by the band members in the splash teaser photos shown on Slipknot's website, reportedly because the masks represent the band's ego. 2008-07-01 The are two versions of the video. One uses the album version of the song, whilst the other uses a much shorter version of the song; excluding the \"Limit of the Dead!\" lines. This song was nominated to best rock video at the VMA´s 2008.Slipknot - Psychosocial (Album Edit Video) ==Personnel== * (#0) Sid Wilson – Turntables * (#1) Joey Jordison – Drum kit * (#2) Paul Gray – Bass guitar * (#3) Chris Fehn – Percussion instrument, backing vocals * (#4) Jim Root – Electric guitar * (#5) Craig Jones – Sampler (musical instrument), * (#6) Shawn Crahan – Percussion instrument, backing vocals, * (#7) Mick Thomson – Electric guitar * (#8) Corey Taylor – Vocals ==References== Category:2008 songs Category:Slipknot songs",
