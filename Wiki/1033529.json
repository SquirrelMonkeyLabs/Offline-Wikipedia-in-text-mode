 "text": "Norhayati's gliding frog, orange-sided whipping frog, or Wallace's orange- sided tree frog (Rhacophorus norhayatii) is a frog. Scientists have seen it in Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Scientists thought this was the same frog as Rhacophorus reinwardtii, but they changed their minds in 2010. R. norhayatii has darker colored webbed skin on its feet. It is black with blue marks. The first toe of the front feet only has some webbing, but on other frogs it is webbed almost all the way to the end of the toe. R. norhayatii has brown color on the sides of its body. The skin of its back is green with no marks or spots on it. Also, adult male R. norhayatii frogs are larger than adult male R. reinwardtii and smaller than adult male R. nigropalmatus and R. kio: The adult male R. norhayatii frog can be as big as 64.7 mm long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog can be 83 mm long. The front feet of R. norhayatii are bigger than the rest of the front leg. The frog's belly is white in color, and there are blue and white marks on the chin and neck. The toes on all four feet are black with some blue and green marks.
