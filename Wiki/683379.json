 "text": "Greater China is a name sometimes used for all the regions that both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) claim (though may not completely control). This includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The PRC controls mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while the ROC controls Taiwan. Each of these regions have their own passport, currency, travel rules, labor laws, and constitutions. General Secretary Xi Jinping added Xi Jinping Thought into the Communist Party's constitution during the Communist Party of China's 19th Congress (the 19th time it held elections), and one part of it says that all of China must reunite as one country.
