 "text": "Bahrain is an island-country in the Persian Gulf. It is made of an archipelago. The term wildlife of Bahrain is used to describe the flora and fauna there. In the north and the west of the country, potatoes are grown, with irrigation. The rest of the country has a very dry climate, what geographers call arid. Summers are hot and dry, and winters are mild. Sometimes there is brackish water. This means that many plants have adaptations that allow them to survive in such a climate. 196 species of higher plants have been observed, and about seventeen species of terrestrial mammals. There are also many species of birds and reptiles. Many species of migratory brirds spend either utumn or spring there. == Geography == Bahrain is a group of islands on the western side of the Persian Gulf, approximately halfway between Saudi Arabia, to the west and Qatar, to the east. Bahrain Island is the largest island and is long by wide. It consists of a low plain with a central hill, the Mountain of Smoke. Its highest point is above sea level. There are five other small islands and many islets. To the north lies the Persian Gulf, and to the south and west lies the Gulf of Bahrain. It has two connections to the Persian Gulf, one either side of Bahrain. Also part of Bahrain are the Hawar Islands, which lie close to the coast of Qatar and are about southeast of the main islands. These were designated in 1997 as a Ramsar site, a wetland habitat of international importance for wildlife. The climate is very hot in summer and rather cooler in winter, with an average temperature of in August and in January. Precipitation averages and falls in small amounts in winter. The terrain is mostly arid. Agriculture is only possible on eight percent of the land area. Water is extracted from the Dammam Aquifer but this is becoming increasingly brackish and desalination plants are used more and more to provide fresh water. == Environmental issues == Environmental problems in Bahrain include droughts, dust storms, the degradation of arable land, the desertification of the coastline and rising sea levels associated with global warming. == Flora and fauna == 195 species of higher plant have been recorded on the islands. 17 species of terrestrial mammal are found here as well as 14 species of reptile, a single species of amphibian and 54 species of fish. More than 330 species of birds were recorded in the Bahrain archipelago.26 species breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian Gulf region in the winter and autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar Islands. Bahrain's national bird is the bulbul while its national animal is the Arabian oryx. And the national flower of Bahrain is the beloved Deena. The only protected area in the country is the Al Areen Wildlife Park in Sakhir, a nature reserve and zoo. It was established in 1976 and covers a total area of . Date palms, citrus trees and alfalfa are cultivated in the north and west of the main island, using irrigation.. In this irrigated region, many species of plant grow that are not present in the arid conditions prevailing elsewhere, where vegetation is more sparse. The Tree of Life is a lone Prosopis cineraria tree some 400 years old growing on the site of an ancient fort, surrounded by desert. The soils on the coast are home to salt-tolerant plants. Manny of these can secrete salt from glands on their surfaces. One of the most common of these is the dwarf shrub Zygophyllum qatarense.. This shrub has many adaptations to the harsh environment. Further inland, perennial plants adapt to arid conditions by being dwarf or prostrate, being deciduous, having deep root systems, reducing their leaf surface area, and having thorns and hairs. Annual plants appear when rain falls, and pass through an accelerated life cycle to flower and set seed in a few weeks. The largest terrestrial mammal in Bahrain is the sand gazelle. Over two hundred sand gazelles can be found on the privately owned island of Umm an Nasan. Others are present on Bahrain Island and the Hawar Islands. Other mammals include the Arabian hare, the desert hedgehog, the long-eared hedgehog and the Indian grey mongoose. The lesser Egyptian jerboa is a nocturnal desert resident, and bats living in Bahrain include the trident bat, naked-rumped tomb bat, Kuhl's pipistrelle and RÃ¼ppell's pipistrelle, though the latter has not been recorded in Bahrain since 1984. In close proximity to human habitations are found the black rat, brown rat, house mouse and Asian house shrew. About 340 species of bird have been recorded in Bahrain. Most birds are migrants on their way southwards in autumn and northwards in spring. There are a range of habitats to which they are attracted including cultivated areas, open countryside, marshes, mudflats and mangrove swamps. Visiting wetland birds include sandpipers, curlews and plovers, and the mangrove areas are favoured by egrets, herons, flamingoes, terns and gulls. The Hawar Islands have fewer habitat types and only about 60 migratory species have been recorded here. Many of these are seabirds and after the spring migrants have departed northwards, the breeding birds start to arrive. The Hawar Islands have been designated as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area by BirdLife International. The main trigger species are the western reef heron, Socotra cormorant, white-cheeked tern, Saunders's tern and the Sooty falcon. It is also an important wintering area for the great crested grebe and the greater flamingo. Goitered gazelle and Arabian oryx have been reintroduced to the Hawar Islands. The sea around the islands has extensive areas of seagrass and algae, and supports a variety of marine life including sea turtles and the largest aggregation of dugongs outside Australia. The extensive coral reefs around Bahrain are composed of coral species with a tolerance of high temperatures and high salinity levels. Nevertheless, some corals experienced bleaching in the summers of 1996 and 1998, and coral reefs in the area have been destroyed by dredging and by the increased level of sedimentation this causes. == References == Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Geography of Bahrain",
