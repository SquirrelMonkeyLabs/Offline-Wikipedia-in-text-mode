Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo died in his Venetian palace in 1949 and was buried in the Verano Cemetery in Rome. == Works == In 1907, Fortuny created her most spectacular dress: the \"Delphos Dress\" in pleated silk, made famous by the theatrical legends of the time, Isadora Duncan and Sarah Bernhardt. Designed in a revolutionary form, inspired by the clothes of ancient Greece, the long dress was both simple and wide, artistic and functional; the hems were adorned with colored Venetian glass beads, with a decorative but also functional function. In 2012, the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute in New York City mounted an exhibition of his work. His clients include Élisabeth, Countess Greffulhe and her daughter Élaine Greffulhe, Eleonora Duse, Ellen Terry and Oona O'Neill. In Paris, he owned from 1912 a shop 2 bis rue de Marignan, transferred in 1922 67 rue Pierre-Charron. In London, he opened a boutique in 1912 at 29 Maddox Street (en) and Bond Street. == References == Category:1871 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Spanish fashion designers",
