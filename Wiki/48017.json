They had popular songs in the 1970s and 1980s. Devo had a big influence on the new wave music movement. Devo often used various keyboards (called synthesizers) in their songs, including the Moog synthesizer. Their most famous song was called \"Whip It\". That song was released in 1980. Devo occasionally performs concerts for the public. == Discography == * Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are DEVO!
