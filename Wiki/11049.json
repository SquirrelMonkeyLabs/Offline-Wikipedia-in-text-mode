 "text": "Catherine de'Medici(13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589) was an Italian noblewoman from the powerful Medici family. She became Queen of France as the wife of King Henry II and was the mother of three French kings: Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. They were sometimes called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici.\" Born in Florence, Italy, Catherine married Henry in 1533, arranged by her relative, Pope Clement VII. When Henry became king in 1547, Catherine was pushed aside by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. But after Henry's death in 1559, Catherine took control as the mother of young King Francis II. After Francis died a year later, she became regent for her second son, Charles IX, and later helped her third son, Henry III, rule as king. During her time as queen and regent, France was troubled by wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). At first, Catherine tried to make peace with the Protestants, but later turned to harsher measures. She is often blamed for the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, when thousands of Protestants were killed, though it is unclear how much she was involved. Despite many difficulties, Catherine kept the French monarchy from collapsing. She was also a supporter of the arts and tried to improve the image of the monarchy through culture and building projects. Many historians consider her one of the most important women in Europe during the 16th century. Without her, the Valois family might not have stayed in power. == Children == Catherine de' Medici married Henry, Duke of Orléans, who later became Henry II of France, on 28 October 1533 in Marseille. Together, they had ten children, of which four sons and three daughters survived to marry. Three of her sons became kings of France, while two daughters married kings and one married a duke. Catherine outlived all her children except Henry III, who died just seven months after her, and Margaret, who inherited her strong health. Among her children, Victoire and Jeanne were twin daughters born in 1556. Unfortunately, Jeanne was stillborn, and Victoire died shortly after birth. The birth nearly killed Catherine, and after this, doctors advised her and Henry to have no more children. * Francis II, King of France (19 January 1544 – 5 December 1560).
