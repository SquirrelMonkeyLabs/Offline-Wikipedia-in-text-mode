 "text": "A prerogative is an exclusive power or privilege possessed by an official of a government or state as a part of his or her office. Under English law it is right of a sovereign, which in theory, has no restrictions. For example, the British monarch holds Royal prerogatives which have never been fully listed. In practice, they are usually used by ministers on behalf of the monarch. In the United States, the Constitution is written in such a way to allow executive prerogatives. Presidents use these powers to manage crises or to resolve disputes. Although nothing in the Constitution specifically gave him the power to do it, George Washington used executive prerogative to declare neutrality in the 1790s dispute between Great Britain and France. Thomas Jefferson used it to make the Louisiana Purchase. Abraham Lincoln used it many times during the American Civil War. == References == Category:Legal terms Category:Rights",
