 "text": "The Saint Cecilia rocket frog or Santa Cecelia rocket frog (Hyloxalus sauli) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador and Colombia. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 19.7-24.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 22.2-28.7 mm long. The skin of the adult male frog's back is brown or gray. The adult female frog has some cream-white color. Male frogs and female frogs have different colors on their bellies. ==Name== Scientists named this frog fro William Saul, who did good things for Santa Cecilia, Ecuador, and for the University of Kansas' Museum of Natural History. ==Home== This frog lives under dead leaves on the ground and next to streams in forest that has never been cut down and forest that was cut down and is growing back. People do not see them in places that human beings have changed. People have seen this frog between 220 and 800 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Yasuní, Reserva de Producción de Fauna Cuyabeno, Reserva Biológica Limoncocha, Estación de Biodiversidad Tiputini. ==Young== Some scientists say the male frog calls to the female frogs and that male frogs fight each other. Male and female frogs stay together for months. The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. The tadpoles are clear-brown in color with other brown marks and a black mark on the tail. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in not in danger of dying out. It is in some danger because people change the places where it lives to get wood to build with, make farms, make places for animals to live, and dig good metal out of the ground. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
