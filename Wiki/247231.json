 "text": "Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine. It may have a benign cause, but in some cases can be caused by an illness that could cause death. ==Causes== *Problems with the urogenital system (bladder, urinary tract, urethra), kidneys *Renal cell carcinoma *Urinary tract infections *Cystitis *Bladder cancer *Pyelonephritis *Prostate cancer *other prostate problems (enlarged prostate) *Urethritis *Wilms tumor *Kidney stones *Glomerulonephritis *Possibly, allergies == When it might be something else== False alarms can be raised when people have red urine caused by certain medications or eating certain foods. Usually, drugs which cause red or bloody urine should come with warnings either that it will happen or to see a doctor if it does. Booody pee can happen for women on their periods. It might be something else if: *beetroot is turning the urine red or pink *medicine or drugs (are turning the urine red or brown) *bleeding is coming from the bum instead *the woman is on her period ==Self diagnosing== It is not recommended to self diagnose hematuria. ==References== Category:Medical signs Category:Urinary problems",
