 "text": "Licchavi (also Lichchhavi, Lichavi) was an ancient republic that existed in what is now Bihar state of India before the birth of Mahavira (born 599 BC). Its capital was Vaishali. From about 400 to 750, a kingdom in Nepal in the Kathmandu Valley had the same name, Licchavi. ==Origins== Early Buddhist legends tell that Licchavi was a ruling family during Gautama Buddha's time in India, but links to the Nepalese kingdom are speculative. The language of Licchavi inscriptions is Sanskrit, and the particular script used is closely related to official Gupta scripts. That means that India was a significant cultural influence. That was likely through Mithila, now the north of Bihar, India. ==References== ==Other websites== * Tamot, Kashinath and Alsop, Ian. \"A Kushan-period Sculpture, The Licchavi Kings\", Asianart.com * History of Nepal, Thamel.com * \"Nepal: The Early Kingdom of the Licchavis, 400-750\", Library of Congress Countryreports.org (September, 1991) * Vajrācārya, Gautamavajra, \"Recently Discovered Inscriptions of Licchavi, Nepal\", Kailash - Journal of Himalayan Studies, Volume 1, Number 2, 1973.
