 "text": "Dr. Horribleâ€™s Sing-Along Blog is an Internet Musical written by Joss Whedon and starring Neil Patrick Harris. Harris plays a Mad scientist named Billy, also known as Dr. Horrible, who wants to join a Supervillain team called the Evil League of Evil which will only let him in if he murders someone. == Plot == === Act 1 === Billy, pretending to be a villain named Dr. Horrible, records a video of him talking to his audience. Reading his email in the video, he talks about someone he has simply referred to as \"her\" and explains his plan to have her fall in love with him using his freeze ray so she will notice him in the laundromat (\"My Freeze Ray\"). Billy's evil roommate Moist enters the room with Billy's mail. Billy finds a letter from the leader of the supervillain league he applied to, called the Evil League of Evil. In the letter, the leader, named Bad Horse, explains to Billy that he will be graded based on his next crime (\"Bad Horse Chorus\"). The next day, the girl is trying to get people to help people who don't have places to live (\"Caring Hands\") Meanwhile, Billy tries to steal an element called Wonderflonium to power his freeze ray by stealing a van. He is interrupted by the girl from the laundromat, named Penny. She asks for him to sign a piece of paper to help her cause, which he does. Billy then changes into Dr. Horrible and returns to stealing the van. His plan fails when his enemy, Captain Hammer, appears and destroys the remote control Billy was using to control the van. Hammer accidentally steers the van towards Penny, whom he then pushes into a pile of garbage bags. Hammer and Penny talk to each other while Dr. Horrible sneaks away with the Wonderflonium (\"A Man's Gotta Do\"). === Act 2 === Billy finds out that Penny and Captain Hammer have been seeing each other in public, so he watches them and complains about what they're doing (\"My Eyes\"). Billy is back in his house recording another video, outlining his plans to take down Hammer with the freeze ray. The camera cuts to him the next day, who informs the audience that his plan failed, as Hammer watches his videos. Billy gets a phone call from Bad Horse, who informs him that since his plan failed, the only way for him to get into the Evil League of Evil is to kill someone (\"Bad Horse Chorus (Reprise)\").
