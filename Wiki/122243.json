 "text": "Synonyms in taxonomy are similar to normal synonyms, there are two (or more than two) names for the same thing in a scientific classification. For example, the cat has a few scientific names in: Felis silvestris catus, Felis catus, and Felis catus domestica. In botany, the word \"synonym\" has a special meaning. There is one \"correct name\", and the other names are synonyms. For example, Daemonorops draco is the correct name of a species of palm trees, and Calamus draco is a synonym for the same species. In zoology, there is one \"valid name\" and the others are \"junior synonyms\". == Bibliography == * * Category:Taxonomy",
