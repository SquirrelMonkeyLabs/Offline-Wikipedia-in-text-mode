This joined with battalions being formed for the XI International Brigade. * The second was a group of Albacete from French- speaking volunteers. At the end of January 1938, it was put into the Henri Vuilleman Battalion of the XIV International Brigade. ==Sources and notes== *Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, 4th Rev.
