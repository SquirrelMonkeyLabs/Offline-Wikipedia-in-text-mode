 "text": "Lesbianism has been performed in visual arts since the times of ancient Rome. For much of history of cinema and television, lesbianism was regarded as taboo. But since the 1960s, it has increasingly become a theme within its own right. It was first used in softcore movies and erotic thrillers during the 1980s. Acts of lovemaking between women first happened during several movies in the late 1960s: The Killing of Sister George, Therese and Isabelle and The Fox. Lesbian scenes during movies are always subject to controversy. Many people say that the MPAA has been harsh on movies with homosexual themes. One notable example of this regards the movie When Night Is Falling, which was given an NC-17. The movie, though, was released unrated. Category:LGBT",
