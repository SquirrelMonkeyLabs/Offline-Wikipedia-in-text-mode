The city was a Confederate stronghold throughout the war and was the site of the headquarters of the Trans- Mississippi Department of the Confederate Army. Isolated from events in the east, the Civil War continued in the Trans-Mississippi theater for several weeks after Robert E. Lee's surrender in April 1865, and the Trans-Mississippi was the last Confederate command to surrender, on May 26, 1865. Confederate President Jefferson Davis attempted to flee to Shreveport when he left Richmond but was captured en route in Irwinville, Georgia. ==References== == Other websites == * City of Shreveport official website * National Weather Service Shreveport office Louisiana Category:Parish seats in Louisiana",
