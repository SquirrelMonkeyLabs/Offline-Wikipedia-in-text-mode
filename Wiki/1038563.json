 "text": "Admiralty Park is a national park in Singapore that is 27 hectares in size. It is made unique by its river valley shaped hilly terrain. == About == Located in Woodlands, Admiralty Park is the largest park in the north. It is situated on hilly terrain with Sungai Cina river running through it, and houses the largest nature area within an urban park. == Backround == This feature reflects the history of the site as Sungei Cina used to pass through it. Visitors can take the main route along the valley. The park has a natural area of 20 hectares, the largest natural area in a park in Singapore. Most of the park is covered with mangroves. Three paths run through the mangroves, providing places to observe and appreciate flora and fauna with minimal habitat disturbance. The park works closely with the neighboring Republican Polytechnic Institute, which is also the owner of the park under the \"adopt a park\" scheme. One of the joint projects with them was the electronic guide Admiralty Park, an online guide to plants in the park, created by students of the School of Applied Sciences. Admiralty Park is also used for sports recreation, for which there are fitness centers and a jogging track. There are also concerts and performances, hiking and nature walks. Wi-Fi access points for visitors are provided in places around the park. == References == Category:Parks in Singapore",
