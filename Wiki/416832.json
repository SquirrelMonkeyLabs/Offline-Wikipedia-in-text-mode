It also has a triangle on its left side, which is white in color that symbolizes cleanliness, with an 8-rayed sun and 3 stars, which are all yellow in color. The three stars symbolizes the archipelago's three principal islands, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The eight rays of the sun of the flag symbolizes the provinces of Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Manila, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Tarlac. They were the first 8 provinces to be placed under Martial Law by Spain when the Philippine Revolution began since they were the first 8 who have fought against the Spanish colonial rule. The flag of the Philippines when hoisted upside-down shows that the country is at war. The flag was designed by Emilio Aguinaldo. Philippines Category:National symbols of the Philippines",
