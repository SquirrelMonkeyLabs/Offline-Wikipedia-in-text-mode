 "text": "Caltrain is a California commuter rail line. It serves the San Francisco Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley). The southern end of the line is in San Jose at Tamien station. Caltrain has 28 regular stops.In 2018, as explained in the Annual Passenger Counts report on pages 1 & 2, Caltrain changed the counting methodology for weekdays. Prior to 2018, weekday counts were based on all weekday trains, counted once on each weekday (i.e., each train was counted from Monday to Friday of one week). In 2018, an \"average mid-weekday ridership\" count was computed by counting all weekday trains twice on two of three days in the middle of the week (i.e., each train was counted on Tuesday, Wednesday, and/or Thursday for two weeks). Because Monday and Friday ridership lags the mid-weekdays (for 2013-2017, Monday -1%; Friday -9%), the prior methodology of average weekday ridership gives a passenger count approximately 2% lower than the average mid-weekday ridership. == References == Category:Transport in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Rail transport in the United States Category:Commuter rail",
