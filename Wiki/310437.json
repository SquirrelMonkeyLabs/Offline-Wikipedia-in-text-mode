 "text": "La or A is the sixth note of the solfège. \"A\" is generally used as a standard for tuning. When the orchestra tunes, the oboe plays an \"A\" and the rest of the instruments tune to match that pitch. Every string instrument in the orchestra has an A string, from which each player can tune the rest of their instrument. A0 is the lowest note on the standard piano. The octaves follow A1, A2, etc.. A7 is a few pitches lower than C8, the highest note on the standard piano. The note \"A\" is not considered to be a certain milestone or mark to hit with voice as, for example, Tenor C is, but it can be extremely demanding in certain octaves. ==Designation by octave== Scientific designation Helmholtz designation Octave name Standard frequency (Hz) A9 a′′′′′′ Six-lined 14080 A8 a′′′′′ Five-lined 7040 A7 a′′′′ Four-lined 3520 A6 a′′′ Three-lined 1760 A5 a′′ Two-lined 880 A4 a′ One-lined 440 A3 a Small 220 A2 A Great 110 A1 A͵ or ͵A Contra 55 A0 A͵͵ or ͵͵A Subcontra 27.50 A−1 A͵͵͵ or ͵͵͵A Subsubcontra 13.75 ==Common scales beginning on A== *A Major: A B C D E F G A *A Natural Minor: A B C D E F G A *A Harmonic Minor: A B C D E F G A *A Melodic Minor Ascending: A B C D E F G A *A Melodic Minor Descending: A G F E D C B A *A Dorian: A B C D E F G A ==Related pages== *A major *A minor ==Other websites== *Standard Pitch or Concert Pitch for Pianos by Barrie Heaton *Virginia Tech Music Dictionary: A Category:Musical notes",
