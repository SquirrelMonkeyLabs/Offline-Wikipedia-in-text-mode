The word \"block\" was first used to describe this by Charles Janet.Charles Janet, La classification hélicoïdale des éléments chimiques, Beauvais, 1928 ==Blocks== ===p-block=== The p-block is on the right side of the periodic table. Elements from groups 13-18 are in the p-block. ===d-block=== The d-block is in the middle of the periodic table. Elements from groups 3 to 12 are in the d-block. === f-block === The f-block is shown in green in the illustration above. The elements 57 to 71 are called Lanthanides, elements 89 to 103 are called Actinides. === s-block === The s-block is on the left side of the periodic table. Elements from groups 1-2 are in the s-block. ==References== Category:Periodic table",
