 "text": "William Michael Albert Broad (born 30 November 1955), known professionally as Billy Idol, is an English rock musician and singer-songwriter. He became famous in the 1970s as a member of Generation X. He later began a solo career which led to international fame and made Idol a lead artist during the MTV- driven \"Second British Invasion\" in the United States. Idol's second studio album, Rebel Yell (1983), was a major commercial success, featuring hit singles \"Rebel Yell\" and \"Eyes Without a Face\". In 1986, he released Whiplash Smile. Idol then released two studio albums, Charmed Life (1990) and the concept album Cyberpunk (1993). The latter was a commercial and critical flop. A year later, he recorded and released the single \"Speed\". The song was featured as first track in the homonymous movie soundtrack album. Devil's Playground, which came out in March 2005, was Idol's first new studio album in nearly 12 years. The album reached No. 46 on the Billboard 200. This was followed by Happy Holidays, a Christmas album, and Kings & Queens of the Underground, his eighth studio album. Idol's autobiography, Dancing with Myself, was published on 7 October 2014. It soon became a New York Times bestseller. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:English singer-songwriters Category:English rock singers Category:English rock drummers Category:English rock guitarists Category:Musicians from Middlesex Category:New wave singers",
