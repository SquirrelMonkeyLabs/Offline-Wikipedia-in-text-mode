On February 28, 2022, her nomination was sent to the United States Senate.

Teamsters, a case that talked about the power of employers to sue labor unions about the destruction of employer property following a strike. Jackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy; instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a \"judicial methodology\". Politico reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\" Since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments. She spoke an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000. On February 28, 2023, Jackson wrote her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in Delaware v. Pennsylvania. == Legal positions == In January 2022, The New York Times said that Jackson had not yet written many publications showing a legal philosophy. This was mainly because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit only recently, in the summer of 2021. However, The Times said, Jackson's earlier rulings showed a liberal point of view, including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions. A review of many of her judicial opinions showed that she would likely be as liberal as Justice Stephen Breyer, the justice she replaced. According to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, \"Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda\" because she is relatively young, has a background as a public defender, and a history of labor-friendly rulings. Politico reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\" ==Personal life== In 1996, Jackson married Patrick G. Jackson. He is the twin brother of former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's brother-in-law. They have two daughters. She is a protestant. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * * whitehouse.gov: Portrait Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:United States Supreme Court justices Category:Politicians from Washington, D.C.
