 "text": "In science, structure is a fundamental concept. It means the arrangement of parts. Examples are the organs in a body, or crystals in a substance like granite. A structure may refer to buildings, machines and similar things made by people as well as to a rock or a mineral, atoms or sentences. It always reflects the hierarchy of its parts. ==Related pages== *Data structure *Social structure *Structural engineering *For structuralism, see Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss ==Notes== Category:Chemistry Category:Engineering Category:Geology Category:Linguistics Category:Physics Category:Systems",
