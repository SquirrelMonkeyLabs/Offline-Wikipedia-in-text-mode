 "text": "Agmata is a possible extinct phylum of animals. They had a calcareous conical shell. They were first thought to be cephalopods or annelid worms. The agmata had a tube that went through the center of their shell. The name of this phylum comes from the Greek word for \"fragments\". The phylum was proposed by the paleontologist and geologist (1928â€“2006) in 1977. He wanted a phylum for the Early Cambrian fossils Salterella and Volborthella. The Middle Cambrian Ellisell yochelsoni was later also a part of the phylum. The Middle Cambrian fossil Vologdinella was also thought to maybe part of this phylum. This is because it looked similar to the Agmata. However, it was later decided to not add it. The phylum only has one family. This is the Salterellidae. A second family, Volborthellidae, was thought to be added to this family. However, it later became a synonym for Salterellidae. ==References== Category:Animal phyla",
