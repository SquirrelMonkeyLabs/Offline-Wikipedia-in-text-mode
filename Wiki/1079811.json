 "text": "Hunter Zolomon, also known as Reverse-Flash or Zoom, is a major antagonist in the DC Comics universe. He was the main antagonist of the Blitz and Flash War story arcs as well as one of the two main antagonists (alongside Professor Zoom) of both Rogue War and Rebirth (2009). He's one of the four arch-nemeses (alongside Vandal Savage, Captain Cold and Abra Kadabra) of Wally West, and also serves as an enemy of Barry Allen. == Fictional character biography == He was a former F.B.I. profiler that became paralyzed by an attack caused by Gorilla Grodd, due to this he asked Wally West if he can use the Cosmic Treadmill to gain motor functions but he was denied. He became delusional and attempted to use it, which caused it to explode. He was able to regain the ability to walk and obtain powers similar to the speedsters but due to his distorted mind, he believed that Wally West couldn't help him because he never experienced. He thought the only way to get Wally to be a better hero was to be his greatest enemy, becoming the second Reverse-Flash and tormented him. He then lost his ability to walk again before gaining the Speed Force again, later reforming and sacrificing himself to save Wally West from the Black Flash and repair the Speed Force barrier that was caused by Thawne. == Powers and abilities == Hunter Zolomon's primary ability is to alter time relative to himself, as opposed to utilizing the Speed Force like most of the DC Universe speedsters do. He can control his own personal timeline, allowing him to reach unlimited speeds, and he can even stop time altogether. However, he cannot travel back in time. == In other media == Zoom appeared in the live-action Arrowverse television series The Flash, portrayed by Teddy Sears and voiced by Tony Todd. In 2009, Zoom was ranked as IGN's 37th-greatest comic book villain of all time. Category:DC Comics supervillains",
