 "text": "The Texas Panhandle is the northernmost region of the U.S. State of Texas. It is made up of 26 counties. The panhandle is roughly square-shaped and borders New Mexico to its west and Oklahoma to its east. Major cities in the Texas Panhandle include Amarillo, Borger, Canyon, Dumas, Dalhart, and Perryton. The panhandle used to extend further north, containing part of what is today the Oklahoma Panhandle. In 1850, this territory was removed from Texas due to the Compromise of 1820. The compromise banned slavery for all US states above 36°30′ north latitude. Texas, which was recently annexed into the U.S., wanted to keep slavery, so its government was forced to give up the northernmost part of the panhandle. ==References== Category:Texas",
