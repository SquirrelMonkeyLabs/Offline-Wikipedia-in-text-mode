The radio show was originally a production for Watermark, Inc (later a member of ABC Radio known as ABC Watermark). It is currently a production of Premiere Networks. Some of the songs played on AT40 had profanity or offensive content inside them. During the Shadoe Stevens era of AT40, 2 Live Crew's \"Me So Horny\" aired in autumn 1989. Hip hop music was played on the AT40 mostly in the late 1980s and 1990s. It continues now. In the 1970s, disco music aired on AT40. No song began at #1. The closest to that happening was \"Erotica\" by Madonna in 1992. Category:American music Category:Record charts Category:Radio programs Category:1970 establishments in the United States",
