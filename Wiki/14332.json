 "text": "A triangle, otherwise known as a trigon, is a shape, or a part of two dimensional space. It has three straight sides and three vertices. The three angles of a triangle always add up to 180째 (180 degrees). It is the polygon with the least possible number of sides. A triangle with vertices A, B, C is written as \\triangle ABC. The study of geometry related to triangles is called trigonometry. Modern computers usually use triangles to make more complex graphic images or shapes. == Types of triangles == Triangles can be grouped according to how many of their sides are equal: * if all the three sides of a triangle have the same length, then it is an equilateral triangle. * if a triangle has two sides with the same length, then it is an isosceles triangle. * if all the three sides of a triangle have different lengths, then we have a scalene triangle. Triangles can also be grouped by their angles: * if a triangle has a right angle, that is, if one of the angles of that triangle measures 90째 (90 degrees), then it is a right triangle. The opposite side to the right angle is the hypotenuse. * if a triangle has an obtuse angle, that is, if one of the angles of that triangle is larger than 90째, then it is an obtuse triangle. * if a triangle has only acute angles, that is, if all the angles of that triangle are less than 90째, then it is an acute triangle.
