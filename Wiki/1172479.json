The movie follows twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who return to their hometown after their lives become difficult. Sinners has vampires in it, and is set in the Southern United States during the Jim Crow-era. Principal photography for the movie started in New Orleans, Louisiana on April 13, 2024 and ended on July 17, 2024. == Plot == Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore are identical twins who fought in World War I. After the war, they worked for the Chicago Outfit, a crime group. In 1932, they return home to Clarksdale, Mississippi, using stolen money to buy a sawmill from a racist man named Hogwood. They turn it into a juke joint for the Black community. Their cousin Sammie, a blues singer and guitar player, joins them. More people help with the juke joint: Smoke's wife Annie cooks; a Chinese couple, Grace and Bo Chow, provide supplies; and a field worker named Cornbread guards the door. Stack's ex- girlfriend, Mary, and musicians Delta Slim and Pearline (whom Sammie likes) also join. Meanwhile, an Irish vampire named Remmick is being hunted by a group of Choctaw people. He escapes and turns a married Klansmen couple into vampires. On opening night, Sammie's music calls spirits from the past and future. Remmick and his vampires ask to come in, offering money and music, but the twins refuse. After losing Mary, Cornbread, and Stack, Annie guesses they are vampires. She explains the vampire rules: they cannot enter buildings without being invited, cannot be cured, and can only be killed by sunlight, silver, or wooden stakes. Remmick still cannot enter, and offers to leave if they give him Sammie. He wants to use Sammie's music to reach his ancestors from Ireland. He also warns that Hogwood and the Klan plan to attack the juke at dawn. When Remmick threatens to harm the Chows' daughter, Lisa, Grace invites him inside. Only Sammie and Smoke survive the attack. Sammie hits Remmick with his silver guitar, hurting him. Smoke arrives and kills Remmick with a wooden stake. When the sun rises, the other vampires burn and die. Smoke sends Sammie away, then kills Hogwood and his men, but is shot and dies. As he dies, he sees a vision of Annie and their daughter, joining them in the afterlife. Sammie, despite his father's wish for him to give up music and follow God, goes to Chicago and becomes a blues musician. Sixty years later, an old Sammie finishes a performance at his local blues club. Stack and Mary, who turn out to still be alive and have not aged, visit him. Stack says Smoke let him live because he promised not to hurt Sammie. He offers to turn Sammie into a vampire, but Sammie refuses. He plays them one last song. As they leave, Sammie says that before the violence, that night was the best day of his life. Stack agrees, saying it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time he truly felt free. == Cast == * Michael B.
