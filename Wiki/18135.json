It is different to scientific knowledge that can be tested, but belief is not able to be tested. The word is also used to describe what a person expects will happen based on limited information. ==Examples== For instance, a person may believe in God or gods, while \"I believe Amy will come around today\" can also be a belief. Belief is also something you believe in but you cannot prove exactly. ==Related pages== * Faith * Evidence * Falsifiability * Karl Popper * Epistemology Category:Culture Category:Society Category:Religion Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Psychology",
