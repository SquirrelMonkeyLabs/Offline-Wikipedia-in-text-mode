 "text": "Tristichopterus is an extinct genus of tristichopterids from the Upper Devonian. It is the smallest of the Tristichopteridae. It contains a single species, T. alatus. Due to its resemblance to Eusthenopteron, people are often confused if it is a separate taxon or not. == Geology == Tristichopterus could probably be from Laurasia alongside the more famous Eusthenopteron. == Description == Tristichopterus looks a bit like Eusthenopteron, leading to confusion on which is which. The fish is 30 cm long and has backward dorsal fins. == References == # Bishop, P.J. 2012. \"A second species of Tristichopterus (Sarcopterygii: Tristichopteridae), from the Upper Devonian of the Baltic Region\".
