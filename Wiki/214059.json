Therefore they are nicknamed the \"Blackies\". ==History== The club was founded on 1 May 1909. It was founded by teenagers between 16 and 18. The official foundation of the club was in 1912. From 1921 to 1949 Sturm won the styrian championship 11 times. During German occupation the club played his first season in the highest division, the Gauliga Ostmark, but was relegated the same year. 1949 Sturm entered the national league as first team which came not from Vienna. In 1981 the team had the first success, it finished second in the league and reached the quarterfinals of tne UEFA Cup. With the new president Hannes Kartnig a new successful era started. In 1994 Ivica Osim became coach of the team. 1995 they finished second in the league and 1996 they reached their first title, the Austrian Cup beating Admira Wacker. In 1998 they reached the first title. In 1999 they also won the league. The first time they played for the Champions League, they only got one point against Spartak Moscow of Russia. The second time they played there they reached the 3rd place in the group. In the 1999/2000 season of the Champions League they won the Group D versus Galatasaray Glasgow Rangers and AS Monaco. After this success some key players left the club and also coach Ivica Osim. Since 2005 Sturm has had financial problems. Therefore Sturm was forced to play with young players.
