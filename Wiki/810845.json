 "text": "Dustin John Higgs (March 10, 1972 - January 16, 2021) was an American murderer. He was born in Poughkeepsie, New York. Higgs was sentenced to death for the murders of three young women in Maryland. The main controversy about Higgs's case was that Higgs did not personally kill any of the three victims. The man who fatally shot all three women to death, Willis Mark Haynes, was sentenced to life plus 45 years, while Higgs, who was in a vehicle when the killings took place, received a death sentence. It was argued that although Higgs did not kill anyone, he was the person in charge, and not only ordered Haynes to kill the women but bullied him into it. Higgs was scheduled for execution by lethal injection on January 15, 2021. He was executed on January 16 at the USP Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana at the age of 48.U.S. Executes Dustin Higgs In 13th And Final Execution Under Trump Administration ==References== Category:1972 births Category:2021 deaths Category:African- American people Category:American people executed for murder Category:Criminals from New York (state) Category:People executed by lethal injection Category:People from Poughkeepsie, New York",
