 "text": "Shalanda Delores Young (born August 29, 1977) is an American politician. She was the 43rd Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from 2021 to 2025 during the Joe Biden presidency. She was deputy director from 2021 until 2022. She worked for the United States House Committee on Appropriations as its staff director. After Neera Tanden's nomination as OMB director failed to pass in the United States Senate, Young has been supported by both Democratic and Republican politicians to be nominated as the OMB director. On November 24, Biden announced he would nominate Young as OMB director, after eight months serving as acting director. The Senate confirmed Young in a 61-36 vote on March 15, 2022. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Louisiana Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:1977 births Category:Directors of the Office of Management and Budget Category:People from Zachary, Louisiana",
