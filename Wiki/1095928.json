 "text": "The Yasin (Arabic: ياسين), also known as Yassin or Al-Yassin, is a RPG weapon made by the Al-Qassam Brigades which is the military group of Hamas. It's used to destroy tanks and other armoured vehicles and was first used in 2004. It's named after Hamas' leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, who was killed by the Israeli Forces on March 22, 2004. The Yasin was shown for the first time in August 2004. It was created by engineers from Hamas, led by Adnan al-Ghoul, who was killed by the IDF on October 22, 2004. The design of the Yasin was influenced by two other weapons: the RPG-2 and RPG-7. The RPG-2 was used for the launcher's tube design and the shape of the warhead. The RPG-7 was used for the enhanced warhead and the nozzle at the launcher's rear. This nozzle helps reduce the recoil when firing the rocket. The Yasin is made in small underground workshops and uses TNT and powdered ammonium nitrate as explosives. It's said to have a range of 200 to 250 meters, according to Israeli intelligence. ==Related pages== *Qassam rocket *Bazooka *Anti-tank guided missile ==References== Category:Hamas Category:Firearms",
