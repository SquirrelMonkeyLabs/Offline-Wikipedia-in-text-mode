Her great- great uncle was the famous preacher and author William Ellery Channing (1780-1842). She wrote poetry from her childhood. She decided to write more after her husband, painter Fairfield Porter, died in 1975. Her first book, An Altogether Different Language, came out when she was 83 years old. It was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1994. Her poems were often about spiritual subjects. Poet David Shapiro called her “an American religious poet of stature who reminds us that the idea of the holy is still possible for us.” Porter died just before her 100th birthday in 2011. ==Books== *The Birds of Passage (1989) *An Altogether Different Language (1994) *Living Things: Collected Poems (2006) == Related pages == *List of poets from North America ==References== Category:1911 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American poets",
