 "text": "Emerging technologies are technologies whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized. These technologies are generally new but also include old technologies finding new applications. Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo. == Related pages == Agriculture * Cultured meat * Genetically modified food * Agricultural robot * Cellular agriculture
