 "text": "Meitei marriage (Manipuri marriage) () or Meitei wedding (Manipuri wedding) () are the traditions and practices that relate to wedding ceremonies and marriage rituals prevailing within the Meitei culture. The ceremonies and customs have changed greatly in the past 350 years. Original traditional Meitei weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern matrimonial practices of the Sanamahists and rural weddings (in Loi villages of Manipur). Notably, modern day Sanamahist matrimonial practices are in fact, the original true traditional Meitei wedding without the influence of foreign culture. No matter what religion one follows, the Meiteis are not allowed to marry between the persons of the same salai (clan). Else, severe punishment or banishment from the society (colony) is the usual result in Meitei culture. Generally, in urban areas, monogamy is common while in rural areas, polygamy is not rare. The marriage process usually starts with the meeting between the couple's families and the consultation on the two's horoscopes. If everything is fine, the marriage day will be fixed and finally, the partners will be wedded. Regarding the cultural diversity of the Meitei ethnicity, there are the adherents of Sanamahism and Hinduism. During early times, there were strong religious barriers between the castes inside the Meitei ethnicity. For instance, a general Meitei (either Hindu or Sanamahist) cannot marry a person who belongs to Meitei Pangals (Manipuri Muslims) or other communities. == Traditional Meitei practices == In the traditional Meitei marriage ceremony, brides do not wear potloi. Instead, they wear phanek (traditional Meitei sarong) and Kajenglei (traditional Meitei headdress). Besides, the sacred chantings will all be done in Classical Meitei language. == Hindu Meitei practices == In the Meitei Hindu marriage, brides wear potloi instead of phanek. Besides, many of the sacred chantings are performed in Sanskrit in addition to Classical Manipuri language. Since Hinduism among the Meitei ethnicity is actually brought from the Vaishnavism of Bengal, the Meitei Hindus somehow imitate and follow the traditional matrimonial styles of the Bengalis. == Gallery == File:Manipuri Bride.jpg File:Verona Khumukcham On her wedding Day.jpg File:Pinly Laishram On her wedding day.jpg File:Manipur Wedding.jpg == References == Category:Meitei religion",
