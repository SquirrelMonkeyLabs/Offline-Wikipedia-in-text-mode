He was called a \"Social Saint\" during that time.The 'Social Saints' of Turin - at time of writing - are taken to be Giuseppe Benedetto Cottolengo, John Bosco, Maria Domenica Mazzarello, and Leonardo Murialdo, who took it as their task to minister to the dispossessed, marginalized and often criminal elements Turin which was in the throes of industrialization.
