 "text": "Ruanruan (; also called Rouran) is an extinct language of Mongolia and northern China. It was spoken in the Rouran Khaganate from the 4th to the 6th centuries CE. Most linguists argue it is likely a Mongolic or Turkic language but some say Ruanruan may be a Yeniseian language.Vajda, Edward J. (2013). Yeniseian Peoples and Languages: A History of Yeniseian Studies with an Annotated Bibliography and a Source Guide. Oxford/New York: Routledge. In 2018, Brāhmī Bugut and Khüis Tolgoi inscriptions suggest that the Ruanruan language was a Mongolic language, close to Middle Mongolian. ==References== Category:Languages of China Category:Extinct languages Category:Pages with unreviewed translations",
