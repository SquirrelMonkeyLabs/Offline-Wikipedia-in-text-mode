 "text": "A light beam or beam of light is a small projection of light energy coming from a source into a beam. Sunlight is a natural example of a light beam when it crosses through various objects (clouds, foliage, windows, etc.). To produce fake light, a lamp and a parabolic reflector is used in many lighting devices such as spotlights, car headlights. Light from certain types of lasers has the smallest possible beam width, so it produces the most parallel light beams possible. Category:Optics",
