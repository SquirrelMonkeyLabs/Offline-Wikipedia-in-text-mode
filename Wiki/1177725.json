 "text": "On 1 July 2002, BAL Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937, a Tupolev Tu-154 passenger jet, and DHL International Aviation ME Flight 611, a Boeing 757 cargo jet, collided in mid-air over Überlingen, a southern German town on Lake Constance, near the German-Swiss border. All of the passengers and crew aboard both planes were killed, resulting in a total death toll of 71. According to eyewitnesses, immediately after the crash, several explosions were heard, the sky turned red, and then a series of burning pieces fell to the ground. The first television images showed the extent of the plane's destruction and the scattering of debris that reached the ground after the crash. The tragedy claimed the lives of 71 people, including children, adults, and the ship's crew. There were no survivors. On February 24, 2004, Peter Nielsen, the air traffic controller on duty at the time of the collision, was killed in an apparent act of revenge by Vitaly Kaloyev, a Russian architect whose wife and two children died in the tragedy. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2002 in Europe Category:2000s in Germany Category:2000s in Russia Category:2000s in Switzerland Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Europe Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the 2000s Category:July 2002 events Category:Bodenseekreis",
