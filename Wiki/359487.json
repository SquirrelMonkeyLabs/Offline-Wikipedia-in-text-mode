Seventeen genera live in sub-Saharan Africa.Shiotz, 1999 Hyperoliids range from to in body length. Many species have smooth, brightly patterned, skin that almost looks enameled. Most hyperoliids live in trees. Some live on land, including several Kassina species that move by walking or running rather than hopping. Diet varies widely, with examples including Tornierella, who eats snails, and Afrixalus fornasinii, the only land frog known to eat eggs of other species of anurans. Breeding in this family begins at the start of the rainy season. Hyperoliids come together at breeding sites. Most hyperoliids lay their eggs in water. Tadpoles are pond type larvae with large dorsal fins on the tail. No fossil hyperoliids are known. ==Classification== Family HYPEROLIIDAE * Subfamily Hyperoliinae ** Genus Acanthixalus - African wart frogs ** Genus Alexteroon - Midwife frogs ** Genus Arlequinus - Mebebque frogs ** Genus Callixalus - African painted frogs ** Genus Chlorolius - Koehler's green frogs ** Genus Chrysobatrachus - Itombwe golden frogs ** Genus Cryptothylax - Wax frogs ** Genus Heterixalus - Madagascan reed frogs ** Genus Hyperolius - African reed frogs ** Genus Nesionixalus * Subfamily Kassininae ** Genus Afrixalus - Banana frogs ** Genus Kassina - Running frogs ** Genus Kassinula - Clicking frogs ** Genus Opisthothylax - Grey-eyed frogs ** Genus Paracassina - Common striped frogs ** Genus Phlyctimantis - African striped frogs ** Genus Semnodactylus - Weal's frogs ** Genus Tornierella * Subfamily Tachycneminae ** Genus Tachycnemis - Seychelles Islands frogs ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
