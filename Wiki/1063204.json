Fawcett, the founder of Fawcett Publications. * In the pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity, the Marvel Family lived in an unnamed metropolis, implied to be an original fictional city since most major American cities (including New York) would be mentioned as distinct from the heroes' hometown on various occasions. This would be contradicted in Shazam!, which indeed suggested Billy Batson's city to be New York, however in Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe #4 (1985), the base of operations of Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. was stated to be Fawcett City in their respective entries. Months later, writer Marv Wolfman established Fawcett City in-story in Crisis on Infinite Earths #7. The New Earth version of the city first appeared in the 1994 graphic novel The Power of Shazam! (graphic novel) by Jerry Ordway. Previously, Captain Marvel had lived in San Francisco (Shazam! The New Beginning). * Fawcett City's location had never been firmly established, though it was in the Midwest. Differing sources indicate: ** Indiana ** Minnesota, at the location of Minneapolis ** Wisconsin, based on implicit hints in The Power of Shazam! (Volume 1) * However, the New 52 made Fawcett City a suburb of Philadelphia. Category:Fawcett Comics",
