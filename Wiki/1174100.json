In June 1930, Manila High School, founded in 1906, was split into two â€” Manila South High School which was named Manuel Araullo High School and Manila North High School which was named Cayetano Arellano High School. In the immediate post-World War II years, Cayetano Arellano High School had become the largest public school in Manila. To accommodate the growing number of students, annexed branches of the school were spun off, such as the Jose Abad Santos High School in 1948, and Manuel L. Quezon High School in 1949. ===Expansion=== * Manuel Luis Quezon High School (Manila) founded in 1949 * Manuel Luis Quezon High School (Caloocan City) founded in 1957 * Manuel L.
