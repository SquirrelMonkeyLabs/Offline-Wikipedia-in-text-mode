 "text": "Chaparral is a shrubland or heathland plant community. It is found mainly in the U.S. state of California. Also in the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. It is caused by a Mediterranean climate (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and wildfire. A chaparral has summer drought- tolerant plants.Nancy Bauer, The California Wildlife Habitat Garden (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012), p. 175 They have hard sclerophyllous evergreen leaves.William Skinner Cooper, The Broad-sclerophyll Vegetation of California: An Ecological Study of the Chaparral and its Related Communities (Washington, DC: Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1922), p. 21 Chaparral covers 5% of the state of California. Of the associated Mediterranean shrubland, it covers an additional 3.5%. The name comes from the Spanish word chaparro, referring to scrub oaks.Peter R. Dallman, Plant Life in the World's Mediterranean Climates: California, Chile, South Africa, Australia, and the Mediterranean Basin (Berkeley: University of California Press; Sacramento: California Native Plant Society, 1998). p. 67 There are four other chaparral regions in the world. #parts of the Mediterranean coast, known as maquis #Central Chile, known as matorral #South African Cape, known as fynbos #South Australia, known as kwongan Chaparral does not often have fires. These are usually at intervals from 10â€“15 years to over a hundred years. Mature chaparral often has dense thickets. They are highly flammable. == References == Category:Ecoregions",
