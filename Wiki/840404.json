 "text": "The United States federal government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995–96 was caused by problems between Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress over funding for education, the environment, and public health in the 1996 federal budget. The shutdowns lasted from November 14 through November 19, 1995, and from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, for 5 and 21 days. ==Shutdowns== The first shutdown happened after Clinton vetoed the spending bill the Republican-controlled Congress sent him, as Clinton did not support the budget cuts favored by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and other Republicans. The first budget shutdown ended after Congress passed a temporary budget bill, but the government shut down again after Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on a long-term budget bill. The second shutdown ended with congressional Republicans accepting Clinton's budget proposal. The first of the two shutdowns caused the furlough of about 800,000 workers, while the second caused about 284,000 workers to be furloughed. ==Effect== Polling generally showed that most respondents blamed congressional Republicans for the shutdowns, and Clinton's handling of the shutdowns helped his successful campaign in the 1996 presidential election. The second of the two shutdowns was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history until the 2018–2019 government shutdown passed it in January 2019. ==More readings== *CRS Report for Congress: Shutdown of the Federal Government: Causes, Processes, and Effects ==References== Category:1995 in the United States Category:1996 in the United States Category:1996 events",
