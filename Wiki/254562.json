 "text": "The Renault Mégane is a car produced by Renault in four generations since 1995. == First generation (1995–2003) == The first Mégane arrived in late 1995 to replace the 19. It came in many bodystyles and engines, the model formed the basis for the Scénic, Europe's first compact MPV which arrived in late 1996. The range was facelifted in April 1999 and an estate/wagon version appeared but wasn't sold in the UK. Although a new Mégane arrived in late 2002, the original was sold into 2003 until all bodystyles were redesigned. === Models === File:Mégane RXE 1.4 16V.jpg|5-door hatchback (Mégane) File:Renault Mégane Classic.jpg|4-door saloon (Mégane Classic) File:Renault Mégane Coach Phase I 16V Montecarlo.JPG|2-door coupé (Mégane Coach) File:Renault Megane Cabrio front 20071004.jpg|2-door convertible (Mégane Cabrio) File:Renault Mégane Grandtour 1.6 16V Facelift.JPG|5-door station wagon (Mégane Grandtour) === Engines === ==== Petrol engines ==== * 1.4 51 kW (69 hp) and 55 kW (75 hp) * 1.4 16V 70 kW (95 hp) * 1.6 55 kW (75 hp) and 66 kW (90 hp) * 1.6 16V 79 kW (107 hp) * 1.8 16V 85 kW (115 hp) * 2.0 84 kW (114 hp) * 2.0 16V 110 kW (150 hp) * 2.0 IDE 103 kW (140 hp) ==== Diesel engines ==== * 1.9 D 47 kW (64 hp) * 1.9 dT 66 kW (90 hp) * 1.9 dTi 59 kW (80 hp) and 72 kW (98 hp) * 1.9 dCi 75 kW (102 hp) == Second generation (2002–2010) == The second Mégane arrived in late 2002 with the hatchback models, other versions appeared during 2003.
