 "text": "Eduard Bloch was a Jewish Austrian doctor practicing in Linz (Austria) and until 1907 the physician of Adolf Hitler's family. Bloch was born in Frauenberg (today Hluboká nad Vltavou, Czech Republic) in 1869. He studied medicine in Prague and then served as a medical officer in the Austrian army. In 1899 he was stationed in Linz and opened a private doctor’s practice after his discharge in 1901. He lived and worked in the baroque house at 12 Landstrasse. He lived with his wife, Emilie (née Kafka) and their daughters Trude and Emilie. According to Linz’s future mayor Ernst Koref, Bloch was held in high regard, particularly among the lower and indigent social classes. It was generally known that at any time at night he was willing to call on patients. He used to go on visits in his hansom, wearing a conspicuous broad- brimmed hat. Like most Jews in Linz at the time, the Bloch family were assimilated. Nazi Germany took over Austria in 1938. In 1940, Bloch moved from Austria to New York City with his wife, daughter, and son in law to escape antisemitism. He died in 1945 in The Bronx.
