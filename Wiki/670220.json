 "text": "The Yellow Vests movement (, ; ; ), also called as the Yellow Jacket movement in English, is a protest movement in Europe which began with a petition posted in May 2018, and which took action for the first time on Saturday, 17 November 2018. The \"yellow vests\" blocked roads and caused traffic chaos on Saturdays. The demonstrations stem from anger over rising diesel fuel prices and taxes. By November 24, The Gilets jaunes protests had led to two deaths and over 750 injuries, including 136 police officers. Two days later, officials estimated that the damage in Paris alone could be up to €1.5m (£1.3m), and had mobilised 200 additional workers to assist with the cleanup and repair work. By December 2, The Gilets jaunes protests had led to three deaths, the third being in Arles, according to Reuters. ==References== Category:May 2018 events Category:November 2018 events Category:December 2018 events Category:2018 in France Category:2010s in Germany Category:2010s in the Netherlands Category:2010s in Italy Category:21st century in Bulgaria Category:2010s protests",
