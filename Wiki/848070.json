Four people were killed, and another was wounded, all from the same family. The killing has been called a terrorist attack caused by Islamophobia by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Police charged 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. They believe he planned the attack in advance.
