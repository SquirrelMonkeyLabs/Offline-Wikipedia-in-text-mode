 "text": "Ancient Hawaii covers the time before Western explorers arrived in 1778. During this period, the Hawaiian Islands were settled by Polynesians who created a unique and complex society. == Early Settlers == === Polynesian Voyages === The first people to arrive in Hawaii came from the Marquesas Islands between 300 and 600 AD. They used their knowledge of the stars, wind, and ocean currents to navigate across the Pacific. They brought plants, animals, and cultural practices that shaped early Hawaiian life. === Second Wave of Settlers === Another group of Polynesians came from Tahiti around 1000-1300 AD. They introduced new customs, including the kapu (taboo) system, which became an important part of Hawaiian culture and governance. == Social Structure == === Aliʻi (Chiefs) === Hawaiian society was organized with a class of chiefs called aliʻi. These leaders controlled different areas or entire islands. They held power through their control of land and resources, as well as their religious and military influence. === Makaʻāinana (Commoners) === Most Hawaiians were makaʻāinana, or commoners. They worked the land, fished, and crafted goods. They were required to provide labor and resources to the aliʻi. === Kahuna (Priests) === Kahuna were priests and experts in various fields like medicine and navigation. They played an important role in religious ceremonies and advised the aliʻi on important matters. == Religion and Beliefs == === Polytheistic Religion === Ancient Hawaiians worshiped many gods and goddesses who were believed to control different aspects of life. Some important deities were: * Kane: God of creation and the heavens. * Kanaloa: God of the ocean. * Ku: God of war and agriculture. * Lono: God of fertility, rain, and peace. === Kapu System === The kapu system was a set of sacred laws and taboos that guided everyday life. Breaking a kapu could lead to severe punishment. This system helped maintain social order and religious practices. === Heiau (Temples) === Heiau were sacred places where people performed religious rituals. These temples ranged from simple stone platforms to large, complex structures and were central to Hawaiian religious life. == Economy and Agriculture == === Ahupuaʻa System === Hawaii's land was divided into areas called ahupuaʻa, which stretched from the mountains to the sea. Each ahupuaʻa provided all the resources needed by the community, including food from both land and sea. This system helped manage resources sustainably. === Agriculture === Hawaiians grew crops like taro (kalo), sweet potatoes, and breadfruit. They used special techniques, such as irrigated terraces for growing taro and fishponds (loko iʻa) for raising fish. These methods were well-suited to Hawaii's environment. == Cultural Practices == === Hula === Hula is a traditional Hawaiian dance that uses movement and chant to tell stories. It was important in religious ceremonies and social events and helped preserve Hawaiian history and culture. === Language and Oral Tradition === The Hawaiian language (ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi) was rich in stories, proverbs, and chants. Oral tradition was used to pass down knowledge and history from one generation to the next. === Arts and Crafts === Ancient Hawaiians were skilled in making kapa (bark cloth), featherwork, wood carvings, and lei (garlands). These crafts were used in daily life, religious ceremonies, and as symbols of status. == Warfare and Politics == === Chiefdoms and Alliances === Hawaii was divided into many chiefdoms, each ruled by an aliʻi nui (high chief). Conflicts and alliances between these chiefdoms were common. Success in battles could increase a chief's power and influence. === Unification Efforts === In the late 18th century, King Kamehameha I worked to unify the Hawaiian Islands. By 1810, he had succeeded in bringing all the islands under his rule, marking the end of the ancient Hawaiian period. == Environmental Adaptation == === Sustainable Practices === Ancient Hawaiians managed their environment carefully to ensure that resources would last. They practiced sustainable farming, fishing, and land management to maintain their way of life. === Navigational Skills === The early settlers were expert navigators. They used the stars, ocean currents, and wind to travel across the Pacific and connect with other Polynesian cultures. == References == # Kirch, Patrick Vinton.
