 "text": "Silverstoneia gutturalis is a frog. It lives in Colombia, in Chocó, near the Atrato River. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that are not too high above sea level. People have seen this frog between 30 and 450 meters above sea level. People have only seen this frog during the day. Scientists think it looks for food during the day and sleeps at night. ==Young== Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground and, after the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. They think this because it is what other frogs in Silverstoneia do. Scientists have not seen Silverstoneia gutturalis frogs laying eggs or carrying tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out. The place where the frog lives is hard for scientists to visit. People cut down the forest where the frog lives to get wood to build with . People also dig good rocks out of the ground nearby and that puts bad chemicals in the water. Scientists do not know if people catch this frog to sell as a pet. That has happened to other frogs and amphibians in Chocó. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
