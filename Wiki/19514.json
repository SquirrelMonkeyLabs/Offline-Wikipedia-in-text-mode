Best Screenplay, Woody Allen, Marshall Brickman Annie Hall is a 1977 American romantic comedy movie from United Artists. Woody Allen directed and stars in it. At first it was called Anhedonia, then It Had To Be Jew, but these titles would not sell the movie. Annie Hall has been considered a biography of Allen's real life, but the actor has denied this claim. ==Plot== The movie takes place in New York City and the latter half in Los Angeles, California. It tells the story of Alvy Singer, a comedian from Brooklyn, who is obsessed with death. He has an affair with the title character, Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton) and the two embark on a romance. He encourages Annie to further her career as a nightclub singer. Alvy recalls how his Brooklyn house was below a roller coaster on Coney Island. His father was the owner of a place that had bumper cars, something that reflected the marriage between Alvy's father and Alvy's mother. Throughout the film, many flashbacks are included, often humourously; however, when Alvy recalls his times with Annie, the comedic mood turns nostalgic and Alvy is left wondering what could have happened differently if his insecurities were not in the way. Alvy asks Annie to marry him after they split. She tells him no, as she wants to stay friends. ==Techniques== Annie Hall is noted for its use of special elements such as double exposure (two pictures in one) and magic themes in a real setting. There is an animated scene with a cartoon version of Allen, and the Witch from Disney's Snow White. ==Awards and success== ===Academy Awards=== The movie won four Academy Awards: *Best Picture *Best Director (Allen) *Best Actress (Keaton) *Best Original Screenplay (Allen and Marshall Brickman) Allen was nominated for Best Actor. The movie won one Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy (Diane Keaton). It was nominated for three more: Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), Best Director (Woody Allen), and Best Actor in Musical or Comedy (Woody Allen). The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay. ===Recognition=== It has been called one of the best comedy movies of all time. It has appeared on IMDb's Top 250 List, and was number thirty on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list. In 1992, it was selected to keep in the United States National Film Registry. ==Influence== Many of today's romantic comedy movies have been influenced by Annie Hall. The tie that was worn by Keaton's character was popular at the time of the movie's release. Christopher Walken, who would later become more famous, had a role as the title character's brother. ==References== == Other websites == * *Details on the plot and production Category:1977 romantic comedy movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:BAFTA Award winning movies Category:Best Picture Oscar Category:Brooklyn in fiction Category:1970s English-language movies Category:Manhattan in fiction Category:Movies directed by Woody Allen Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Movies set in New York City Category:Screenplays by Woody Allen Category:United States National Film Registry movies",
