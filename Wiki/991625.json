It was started in 2013, replacing Disability Living Allowance for people over 16. It is tax free. It is for people in or out of work. To get it people must be between 16 and State Pension age and living in the UK. They do not need to have paid any National Insurance Contributions. They have to show that they: * have had difficulties with daily living or getting around (or both) for at least 3 months * expect these difficulties to continue for at least 9 months (unless they are expected to have less than 6 months to live) Each component (part) can be paid at either a standard or enhanced (higher) rate. The ‘daily living component’ is for extra help needed with everyday tasks: * preparing food * eating and drinking * managing medical treatments * washing and bathing * managing toilet needs or incontinence * dressing and undressing * speaking and listening * reading and understanding written information * mixing with other people * making decisions about money There is a check, normally by telephone. Claimants are given a score for each task. 8 to 11 points for daily living gives the lower rate, £68.10. 12 points or more gives the higher rate, £101.75. The ‘mobility component’ is for extra help needed getting around. This includes moving, planning a journey or following a route. 8 to 11 points gives the lower rate, £26.90. 12 or more gives the higher rate, £71.00.
