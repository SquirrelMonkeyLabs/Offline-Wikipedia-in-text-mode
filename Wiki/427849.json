He is often thought of as the first Arab philosopher, and one of the most important scholars in the Islamic world. Al-Kindi was born in Yemen to a rich family. As well as philosophy, he worked in astronomy, alchemy, mathematics, medicine, geography, and many other topics. He became a member of a scientific place of study called the House of Wisdom. As a member there, he helped to preserve a type of philosophy called Hellenistic philosophy. He also edited Greek treatises (written works that formally explain a topic). He also wrote his own treatises on vision, precious stones and minerals. He wrote the first treatise on various types of steel swords, metallurgy. His treatises on music were thought to be the best works on the subject of music in Arabic. He died at age 72 in 873. ==Related pages== *List of scientists from the Middle East ==References== * \"Abu Yusuf Ya Qub ibn Ishaq al-Sabbah al-Kindi.\" Science and Its Times. Ed.
