 "text": "Mark Clarke (born June 1977) is a British former Conservative Party politician. He was a parliamentary candidate. He also was the director for the Young Britons' Foundation. The Young Britons' Foundation isn't a foundation anymore. He was also a chairman of the Conservative Future. The Conservative Future is also not a company anymore. He was the old director of the Road Trip electioneering organisation which was disbanded in 2015. They got Conservative party politicians to parliament in the 2015 general election campaign. Clarke was not allowed to be in the party on 24 September 2015. This is because of the suicide of Elliott Johnson who was another conservative party politician. He said that Clarke was bullying him. After this, many accusations (claims about something that he did) were made against Clarke in newspapers. In November 2015 he was banned for life from joining the Conservative Party. This led to national coverage and led to Grant Shapps resigning as a government minister. == Personal life == Clarke is married to Sarah Clarke. She is National Health Service worker. They have two children. Before this marriage, he was in a relationship with the Conservative member of parliament Justine Greening. == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Conservative Party (UK) people Category:Politicians from London",
