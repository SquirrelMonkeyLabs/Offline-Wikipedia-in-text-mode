The song contains a sample of Labi Siffre's 1975 track \"I Got The ...\". Siffre, who is openly gay, stated, \"attacking two of the usual scapegoats, women and gays, is lazy writing. If you want to do battle, attack the aggressors not the victims.\" Eminem made lyric changes and Siffre cleared the sample. ==Track listing== ;UK CD1 ;UK CD2 ;UK Cassette ;12\" single ;Record Store Day 2020 7\" single ;Notes * signifies a co-producer. ==References== Category:1999 songs Category:Eminem songs",
