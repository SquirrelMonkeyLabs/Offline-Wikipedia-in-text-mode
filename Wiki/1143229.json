 "text": "Findom (short for financial domination) is a type of fetish in which one person derives sexual arousal or satisfaction from controlling or manipulating another person's finances. Typically, the person being controlled is called a \"submissive,\" and the person in control is referred to as a \"dominant\", \"Findomme\" (a female dominant), or \"Findom\" (a male dominant). In Findom relationships, the submissive may give money, gifts, or other forms of financial support to the dominant person. This exchange is often done voluntarily. The submissive may find pleasure in the act of giving money, sometimes as a way to feel humiliated or inferior. The dominant person enjoys having control over the submissive's financial resources. Findom is considered a fetish or a paraphilia, which refers to sexual interests that are considered unusual or outside of typical sexual behaviors. The focus of Findom is not always on sexual activity, but rather on the power dynamics involved, with the dominant person exerting control over the submissive's financial decisions. This fetish can take place in person or online, where interactions may include live chats, social media, or other digital platforms. Some individuals participate in Findom purely for the psychological and power aspects. Others may incorporate it into sexual activities. It is important to note that, like other fetishes, Findom should involve consensual interactions and clear boundaries. As long as the relationship is based on mutual respect and understanding, and does not involve exploitation or harm, it is considered a legitimate form of sexual preference. However, caution is advised to ensure that no one is coerced or taken advantage of financially in these relationships. Category:Sexual fetishism",
