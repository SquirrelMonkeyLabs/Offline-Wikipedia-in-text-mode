The President of Argentina is both the head of the country and head of the government. Executive power is exercised by the President. ==Overview== Argentina was formed by the federative union of the provinces that emerged after the dissolution of the Viceroyalty of the RÃ­o de la Plata, and by the incorporation of those that were constituted from the national territories established as a result of the conquest of large territories natives. Due to the federal nature of its political organization, Argentina has two parallel government structures: on the one hand, the national structure, with its three powers, and on the other hand the 23 provincial structures -which pre-exist the Nation- plus that of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, which have autonomy and are governed by three powers in each case. ==Headquarters== The authorities of the federal government have their headquarters in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It is currently the \"Capital of the Republic\" or \"Capital of the Nation\", denominations used in the national Constitution and in the federalization law, but called the usual way Capital Federal. ==Other websites== * * Text of the Constitution * Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina",
