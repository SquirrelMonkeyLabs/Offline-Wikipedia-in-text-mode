 "text": "Overthrow of Da Yuezhi was a period when Kujula Kadphises overthrew the Yuezhi confederation with his Greek ally.\"According to what we know, we might as well regard Qiujiuque being born around 5 BCE, and becoming the Xihou of Guishuang around 15 CE. Earlier than 19 CE, he formed an alliance with the Greek King, Hermaeus. With the support of Hermaeus, he attacked and destroyed the other four Xihous, and called himself King Guishuang. Formerly as the subject of the Da Yuezhi, the Guishuang replaced Da Yuezhi. Then he overthrew the Da Yuezhi, his former suzerain, unified Tukhārestān and occupied Gandhāra around 60 CE and Taxila around 78 CE, hence founding the Guishuang dynasty, Qiujiuque died around 80 CE.\" == References == Category:Kushan Empire Category:1st-century conflicts Category:Wars involving Asia",
