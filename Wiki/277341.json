 "text": "In behavioural psychology, proactivity is thinking ahead. It means doing things before they are needed. It also means preventing something before it happens. It means the same thing as anticipation. The term is often used in organizational behaviour. Proactive behaviour by individuals anticipates situations in the workplace.Arnold B. Bakker, Advances in Positive Organizational Psychology, Vol. 1 (Bingley : Emerald Group Publishing, Ltd., 2013), p. 263 It means acting in advance of a situation, rather than just reacting afterwards. Proactive employees usually do not need to be asked to do something. They also do not need detailed instructions. Reactive employees are often controlled by the situation around them.Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change (New York: Free Press, 2004), pp. 71â€“72 In an unfamiliar situation they need instructions. == References == Category:Cognition",
