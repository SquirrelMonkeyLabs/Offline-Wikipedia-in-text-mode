 "text": "Terre des hommes is an aid organization. It focuses on Children's rights. Edmond Kaiser founded it in Lausanne, in 1960. The name translates as \"Land of men\" or \"Land of the people\". Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry wrote a book with the same name, which served as inspiration for the name. In English, the book is known as Wind, Sand and Stars. When Kaiser founded Terre des hommes , the Algerian War was ongoing, so one of the first missions was to help children in refugee camps of that war. Today, the name is used for different organizations, which form Terre des Hommes International Federation. Awards: The organisation won the Balzan Prize (2018).
