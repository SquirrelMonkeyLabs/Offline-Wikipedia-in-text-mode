It served the wealthy families of Quiapo, Manila at the time. By the early 20th century, the market had become one of the city's most important markets, generating significant revenues while also serving all social classes. ==Location== What is officially called the Quinta Market and Fishport is a public market along along the banks of the Pasig River. It is bounded by Carlos Palanca Street (formerly Echague Street) in Manila's Quiapo district. ==History== Quinta Market was built by the Spanish colonial government in 1851, the same year as the Divisoria Market in Tondo. Built with money bequeathed to the city government of Manila by the businessman and philanthropist Francisco Carriedo, known for being the benefactor of Manila's pipe water system. At the time, Quiapo was an attractive location for riverside villas along the Pasig River, and this is commemorated by the market's present name, Quinta, which means a \"country villa\" in Spanish. == References== Category:Quiapo Category:19th-century establishments in Asia Category:Philippines Category:Geography of the Philippines",
