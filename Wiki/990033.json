 "text": "Wahida Amiri (born in 1990) is an Afghan librarian and an activist for women’s rights. Amiri runs a library. Since 2017, her library of over 5,000 books is open in Kabul to motivate women to read. But in August 2021, Amiri returned to Kabul to see the Taliban stopping girls and women from going to work and school. She gathered a group of women and started a movement called “Spontaneous Movement of Afghan Women Fighters”. In December 2021, Amiri made it on BBC’s list of the 100 most inspiring women. == Early Life == Amiri was born and raised in Kabul, Afghanistan and temporarily moved to Pakistan and came back to Kabul at 15. When she moved to Pakistan she had to do many of the chores like cooking, cleaning, and scrubbing the floors. After the Taliban was defeated, Amiri returned home. Women and girls could now go to school and work. Even though education was important to Amiri, her family thought taking care of the house and guests was more important. Five years later, she was able to enroll into school with the help of her cousin. == Career == Amiri didn’t learn how to read until she was 20 years old. She took her exams while taking care of her home. She took them over and over until she finally passed. Finally, she was welcomed into a university where she studied law. Amiri discovered the English author Virginia Woolf and finally realized she held power in her voice. When the Taliban took power again in Afghanistan, Amiri lost her job. == Activism == The Taliban said girls cannot go to school. They said women cannot have jobs. Amiri organized women to protest. == References == Category:1990 births Category:People from Kabul Category:Librarians Category:Afghan women's rights activists Category:Living people Category:21st-century Afghan people",
