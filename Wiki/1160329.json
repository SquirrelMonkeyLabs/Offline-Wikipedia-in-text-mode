 "text": "Yakisugi () is a traditional, very old Japanese method of making wood last longer. In Japan, it is known for more than two hundred years. Sometimes it is also called shou sugi ban (焼杉板). By using fire, the surface of the wood is burned, which makes the surface turn to coal. By doing so, rain and water will do less damage to the wood surface. Also insects or fungi do damage the wood because they do not like it. == Examples == Many famous persons who are building houses use yakisugi. It now is becoming also becoming popular in other regions, like Europe and North America. == References == * Category:Woodworking Category:Articles containing Japanese-language text",
