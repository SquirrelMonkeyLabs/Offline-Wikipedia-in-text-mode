 "text": "The Administrator of the Northern Territory is the person selected by the Governor-General of Australia to act as the governor of the Northern Territory of Australia. The selection of Administrator is made by the Governor-General- in-Council, that is, the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Australian government, not the advice of the Government of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978. Now the Governor-General-in Council accepts a recommendation from the Northern Territory Government. Unlike an Australian State Governor, the Administrator does not represent the Queen in the Territory. They represent the Governor- General who is the Queen's representative in the Commonwealth. The Administrator's role is to govern the Territory under the law which gave it self-government. The Administrator's constitutional role is almost the same as a State Governor and can be considered the Queen's indirect representative in the Territory. The office of the Deputy of the Administrator was created in 1997. The present Administrator is Sally Thomas, AM. == South Australia (1846 to 1912) == The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1846 to 1912.
