 "text": "Fingerspelling is making an alphabet with your hands. Many deaf people learn fingerspelling. They use it when they want to sign a word but there is no sign in the sign language, or when they do not understand what the sign means. Other people also use fingerspelling to talk in secret, to help remember something, or to talk without making sound (for example in a church). Fingerspelling is a part of some sign languages. Writing systems are not the same everywhere, and fingerspelling is also different. Different countries have different ways of fingerspelling. Some alphabets use one hand, some use two hands. == References == == Other websites == *ASL Fingerspelling Resource Site Free online fingerspelling lessons, quizzes, and activities. *Fingerspell Flashcards Practice ASL, German and Swiss German alphabets online. *British Sign Language Fingerspelling Alphabet Information and pictures about the British 2-handed fingerspelling alphabet. *ASL Alphabet Image and Video Examples View a sample of each letter of the English alphabet in American Sign Language Category:Sign languages",
