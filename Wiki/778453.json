 "text": "\"Annie's Song\" is a song recorded and written by singer/songwriter John Denver. It was his second number one song in the USA, staying that place for two weeks in July 1974. It also went to number one in the UK. \"Annie's Song\" was written as an poem to Denver's then-wife, Annie Denver (Annie Martel) of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. This song was written in about ten-and-a-half minutes one day on a ski lift to the top of Aspen Mountain in Aspen, Colorado, as the physical exhilaration of having \"just skied down a very difficult run\" and the feeling of total immersion in the beauty of the colours and sounds that filled all senses. By the time he had finished the 10 minute ride, the song was finished. He went straight home and penned the song. The song has since become a wedding standard and an expression of love for many people, due to its grand imagery and the fact it could appeal anyone (Annie is not mentioned by name in any part of the song). == Notes == == Other websites == * The official site of John Denver * Category:1974 songs Category:Pop songs Category:John Denver songs",
