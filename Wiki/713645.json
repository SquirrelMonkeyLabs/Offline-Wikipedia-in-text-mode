 "text": "Celtic punk is punk rock mixed with traditional Celtic music. Celtic punk bands often play covers of traditional Irish, Welsh or Scottish folk and political songs. They often make their own songs too.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (London: Rough Guides, 2003), p. 798. Common themes in Celtic punk music include politics, Celtic culture and identity, heritage, religion, drinking and working class pride. In the 1980s, the Pogues made the genre popular. The Pogues are a band of London Irish punk musicians in London. They were proud of their Irish heritage. The term Celtic punk is usually used to describe bands who combine punk with Irish or Scottish traditional music. It is part of the bigger folk punk genre. However, folk punk usually means punk music that is combined with traditional English or American folk music. Celtic punk bands often have rock instruments (for example a electric guitar) as well as traditional instruments such as bagpipes, fiddle, tin whistle, accordion, mandolin, and banjo. Like Celtic rock, Celtic punk is a form of Celtic fusion.B.
