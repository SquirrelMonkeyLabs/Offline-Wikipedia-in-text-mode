Oneworld Publications. p. 3. . The ulama (literally, the learned ones) More specifically, in Sunni Islam, an aalim is regarded as the one who protects and explains religious knowledge of Islam. Ulama are educated in religious schools called madrasas. By tradition, a student who had completed his studies was accepted by his teacher.
