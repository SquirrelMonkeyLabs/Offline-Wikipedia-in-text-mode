 "text": "Scaphism or The Boats was a supposed method of execution where the condemned was sandwiched between two canoes or halves of a log, force fed milk and honey and be left in the middle of a stagnant body of water. The victim was also covered in the milk and honey and generally stripped naked. The smell of this cocktail and the inevitable excrement attracted insects and other vermin to devour the body. It is unclear whether scaphism was ever actually used, because there are not many reliable sources. ==References== Category:Capital punishment",
