 "text": "Habib Mohebian (; 27 September 1947 – 10 June 2016), commonly known as Habib, was an Iranian singer-songwriter. He was born in Tehran. Habib has many hit songs such as “Marde Tanhaye Shab”, “Shahla”, and “Madar”. The song “Shahla” was inspired after listening to an Azeri performer. However, there is a common misconception that Shahla has been inspired by Habib’s ex-wife (the name of his ex-wife is Shaadi and not Shahla). Habib died on June 10, 2016 in Ramsar, Mazandaran, Iran, from a heart attack, aged 68. ==References== ==Other websites== * Piano Sheet Music and Guitar Chords of Marde Tanhaye Shab * http://www.cloob.com/club/album/photoall/clubname/habib * http://musicboxla.stores.yahoo.net/habib.html Category:1947 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Iranian singer-songwriters",
