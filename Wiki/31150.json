John Payne Todd was a notorious drunkard and gambler, which caused his mother many financial problems, especially after Madison died. In 1814, the British army had burnt the White House. Fleeing from her burning home, Dolley saved many records and papers. Legend states she also saved a painting of George Washington, though had to break it out of its frame.
