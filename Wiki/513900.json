 "text": "Ashley Madison is a Canada-based online dating service and social networking service. It used for people who are married or in a committed relationship. It promotes affairs. Its slogan is \"Life is short. Have an affair.\" The website was launched in 2001. The company received attention on July 15, 2015, after hackers stole all of its customer data—including emails, names, home addresses, sexual fantasies, and credit card information—and threatened to post all the data online if Ashley Madison and fellow Avid Life Media site EstablishedMen.com were not permanently closed. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website * Ashley Madison updates Category:Websites established in 2001 Category:Social networking Category:Canadian websites",
