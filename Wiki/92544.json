 "text": "Potsdam-Mittelmark is a Kreis (district) in the western part of Brandenburg, Germany. The district was created in 1993 by joining the old districts Belzig, Brandenburg-Land and Potsdam-Land. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms is divided into four quarters. The left top one shows a red eagle as the symbol of Brandenburg. The three oak-leaves in the top right are for the many oak forests and also for the three old districts which were joined to form the current one. In the bottom right are two bishop's keys, which stand for the diocese of Brandenburg. The black-and-golden bars in the bottomleft are the symbol of Saxony, and show that the area around Belzig, Brück, Wiesenburg and Niemegk belonged to Saxony until 1815. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Ämter #Beelitz #Belzig #Teltow #Treuenbrietzen #Werder (Havel) Amt-free municipalities #Groß Kreutz #Kleinmachnow #Kloster Lehnin #Michendorf #Nuthetal #Schwielowsee #Seddiner See #Stahnsdorf #Wiesenburg 1\\.
