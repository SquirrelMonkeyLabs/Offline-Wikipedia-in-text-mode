The breed started from the native Shikoku-Inu, an indigenous dog weighing about 25 kilograms (45 pounds) and standing about 55 centimetres high, which closely resembles the European Spitz. These dogs were crossed with European dog breeds, such as the Old English Bulldog in 1872, Mastiff in 1874, St. Bernard, German Pointer in 1876, Great Dane in 1924, and the Bull Terrier. The aim was to breed a larger, more powerful and very fast agile fighting dog. Today it is still used in some countries as a fighting dog, but usually it is kept as a pet where it is ideal companion. In family environment Tosa is patient and very friendly in attitude.see more on popular sites https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DULCRbmScJo ==References== ==Other websites== * Shakuhachi Imperial Tosa-inu * Tosa Inu Information Pages * Wielie Walie Tosa Inu * Molosserworld's Tosa Inu Page * More Japanese dog breeds * Greatbreed.com * Ostuni, Steve (2003) Japanese Tosa.
