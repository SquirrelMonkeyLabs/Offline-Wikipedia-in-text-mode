Syntheses in the purine and sugar group Fischer was the founder of the chemistry of primary natural products: carbohydrates, purines and nucleosides, peptides and proteins. Amongst his many discoveries were the structure of carbohydrates, and he was the first to get synthetic peptides. He studied the active principles of tea, coffee and cocoa, namely, caffeine and theobromine. Fischer also proposed the lock & key model of enzyme action. == Family == Fischer was married to Agnes Gerlach in Feb. 1888, but she died seven years after their marriage.
