 "text": "Sukhoi is a company that primarily makes fighter jets for the Russian Air Force, and many other countries like China, India, Algeria, and Malaysia. Sukhoi has made some of the world's most popular fighter jets, mainly the Su-27. Most of Sukhoi's shareholdings belong in other countries than Russia. The United States has bought aircraft from Sukhoi for aggressive training operations. However, Sukhoi sold aircraft to Iran, and thus the United States banned Sukhoi from ever doing business with them again. == References == Category:Soviet military aircraft Category:Military aviation",
