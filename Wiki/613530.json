 "text": "Erica Garner (May 29, 1990 â€“ December 30, 2017) was an American activist. She fought for police reform, especially in the use of force during arrests. Garner became involved in activism after her father, Eric Garner, died in 2014. A New York City police officer put him in a chokehold during an arrest and killed him. Garner said that she believed her father's death had more to do with police misconduct than race, and in 2017, she rejected a meeting with the United States Justice Department to discuss the police killing her father. During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Garner supported Bernie Sanders, and appeared in an advertisement for him. Garner died in a Brooklyn hospital while in a coma after she had a serious heart attack on December 30, 2017. She was 27 years old. ==References== Category:1990 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:American activists Category:People from Brooklyn",
