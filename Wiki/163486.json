 "text": "A Motion of Confidence is a motion of support proposed by a government in a parliament or other assembly of elected representatives to give the members a chance to register their confidence in a government. The motion is passed or rejected by means of a parliamentary vote. Governments often propose a Motion of confidence to replace a Motion of no confidence proposed by the opposition. Defeat of a Motion of Confidence in a parliamentary democracy generally requires one of two actions: the resignation of the government, or a request for a parliamentary dissolution and the calling of a General Election. In Italy the Constitution provides only the motion of confidence and that of not- confidence. in Mondoperaio, aprile 2014, pp. 7-11. but this does not apply to rules for amending the Constitution. in Mondoperaio, 6/2014. == References == Category:Parliamentary procedure",
