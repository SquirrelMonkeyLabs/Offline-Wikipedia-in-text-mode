The band is made up of Chris Cornell (vocals), who was with Soundgarden until 1997, and Tom Morello (guitar), Tim Commerford (electric bass) and Brad Wilk (drums), who were with Rage Against The Machine until 2000. Their first album Audioslave was released in 2002 and the next one, named Out of Exile, followed in 2005. On May 6, 2005 Audioslave became the first American rock group to play in Cuba. Because of American laws against trade with Cuba, this concert had to be allowed by US authorities. == Studio albums == * Audioslave (2002) * Out of Exile (2005) * Revelations (2006) ==Other websites== *Official website Category:2000s American music groups Category:American rock bands Category:American hard rock bands Category:Post-grunge bands Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in California Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2007 Category:2007 disestablishments in the United States Category:2000s disestablishments in California",
