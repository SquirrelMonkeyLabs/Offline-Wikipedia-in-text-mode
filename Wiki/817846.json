 "text": "The Inland Empire is a metropolitan area and region in inland Southern California, centering on San Bernardino County and Riverside County, which borders Los Angeles County to the east. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Inland Empire was a major center of agriculture, including citrus, dairy, and winemaking. Agriculture declined in the twentieth century. Since the 1970s a rapidly growing population came in search of affordable housing. This led to more residential, industrial, and commercial development. The area has a population of about four million. The majority of Inland Empireâ€™s immigrants are from Mexico, the Philippines, El Salvador, Vietnam and Guatemala. == References == Category:Regions of California Category:Metropolitan areas of the United States Category:Geography of San Bernardino County, California Category:Geography of Riverside County, California",
