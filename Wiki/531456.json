According to the United States Geological Survey, the Cumberland Mountains are long and wide. They are bounded by the Russell Fork on the northeast; the Pound River and Powell River on the southeast; Cove Creek on the southwest; and Tackett Creek, the Cumberland River, Poor Fork Cumberland River, and Elkhorn Creek on the northwest. They form part of the boundary between Kentucky and Virginia. There are many limestone caves on the Virginia side.
