 "text": "Clark Ashton Smith (January 13, 1893 – August 14, 1961) was an American writer, poet, and artist best known for his contributions to the genres of horror fiction, fantasy, science fiction, and weird fiction. A contemporary of H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, Smith was part of the \"Weird Tales\" circle, contributing to the literary movement known as weird fiction. His works often feature lush, evocative language and explore themes of cosmic horror, ancient civilizations, and the grotesque.https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/08/08/weird-fiction- lovecraft-necronomicon/ == Early life == Smith was born on January 13, 1893, in Long Valley, California. A self-taught intellectual with an extensive literary background, Smith was known for his prodigious memory and quick learning abilities, which allowed him to read through the works of Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire, and Arthur Machen from an early age. As a result of frail health, Smith spent much of his youth in isolation, which he devoted to reading and writing poetry. His early work was heavily influenced by his interest in French literature, decadent literature, and exotic, otherworldly settings. == Artistic work == In addition to his literary pursuits, Smith was also a sculptor and painter. His artwork, like his writing, often depicted strange creatures, alien landscapes, and scenes of horror and fantasy. Smith’s sculptures were primarily carved from stone, depicting bizarre forms and imaginary figures inspired by his fiction and poetry. == Selected works == * The Dark Eidolon * The City of the Singing Flame * The Weird of Avoosl Wuthoqquan * The Maze of the Enchanter * The Empire of the Necromancers == Related pages == * H.P.
