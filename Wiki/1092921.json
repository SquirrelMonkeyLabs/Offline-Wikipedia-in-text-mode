 "text": "Danablu, sold under the trademark Danish Blue Cheese in North America, is a strong, blue-veined cheese. It is usually drum- or block-shaped. It has a yellowish, slightly moist, edible rind. It is made from full fat cow's milk and homogenized cream. it has a fat content of 25–30% (50–60% in dry matter). It is aged for eight to twelve weeks. Before it is aged, the mould (Penicillium roqueforti) is pushed through the cheese with copper wires or rods. The holes can be seen in the finished cheese. Danablu was first made early in the 20th century by a Danish cheese maker named Marius Boel. He wanted it to be like Roquefort. Danablu has a milder flavor than Roquefort. It has a sharp, salty taste. It is often served crumbled on salads or as a dessert cheese with fruit. In Denmark, it is often served on bread or crackers. Danablu, Danbo and Esrom are the only three Danish cheeses that have Protected Geographical Status in the European Union. They have to be made in Denmark from Danish milk and at approved dairies. ==Related pages== * Blue cheese * List of cheeses == References == Category:Danish food Category:Cheeses",
