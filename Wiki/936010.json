 "text": "Pride Month is a thematic month where special attention is paid to the emancipation and acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ) people. == History == In the United States, June is LGBTQI+ Pride Month, given the Stonewall riots that took place in New York City in late June 1969, which was a huge boost to the LGBTI+ civil and liberation movements. LGBTQ+ marches and parades have taken place in many American cities since the 1970s, which were followed in many Western countries, although not always in late June. Since 2012, the Google Search has displayed a rainbow-colored decor that changes annually for LGBT-related searches during Pride Month. Since 1999, Democratic Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Biden have officially declared Pride Month in June. Republican President Trump did this in 2019 via Twitter. During this month, many American organizations, institutions and companies are paying attention to LGBT+ issues, including through public and marketing campaigns. However, this can also involve queerbaiting, pinkwashing, and rainbow capitalism. Despite June being Pride Month, in the United Kingdom many pride events are held in July, August and September. == References == Category:LGBT events Category:June observances",
