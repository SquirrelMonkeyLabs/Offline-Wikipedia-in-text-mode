 "text": "\"Frantic\" is a song by the American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on September 15, 2003. It's the second single from their eighth studio album St. Anger. This song is about the band's past struggles with addictions. Most notably, lead singer James Hetfield's alcohol problem. He spent many months in rehab because of this. The lyrics also draw on Zen axioms such as the Buddhist concept of dukkha. ==Music video== A music video was made of \"Frantic\". It was directed by Wayne Isham and made to go along with the song's release as a single. The video was shot in Montreal, Canada. It features a shortened version of the song. It depicts a man looking back on his life. He was always drinking, having sex, and smoking. He then crashes his pickup truck into an RV at an intersection. In-between those clips are scenes of the band playing the song in front of a pile of scrap metal (Hetfield and Hammett) and a set of rocks (Ulrich and Trujillo). At the end of the video, the man's truck is upside-down, but he's still alive. He starts to laugh, but a car crashes into the side of the truck, tipping it overl This presumably kills him. ==Track listing== ;International Single Part 1 #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"Blackened (Live - Download Festival)\" - 6:37 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - Download Festival)\" - 6:41 #\"Frantic (Video)\" * Live tracks recorded on June 1, 2003, at the Download Festival, Donington, UK ;International Single Part 2 #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"No Remorse (Live - Download Festival)\" - 5:16 #\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (Live - Download Festival)\" - 6:40 * Live tracks recorded on June 1, 2003, at the Download Festival, Donington, UK ;International 2-track Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"No Remorse (Live - Download Festival)\" - 5:16 * Live tracks recorded on June 1, 2003, at the Download Festival, Donington, UK ;Belgian Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:53 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - Fields of Rock Festival)\" - 6:46 #\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (Live - Werchter Festival)\" - 6:41 #\"No Remorse (Live - Werchter Festival)\" - 5:52 * \"Harvester of Sorrow\" recorded live on June 15, 2003, at the Fields of Rock Festival, Nijmegen, Netherlands * \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" and \"No Remorse\" recorded live on June 28, 2003, at the Werchter Festival, Werchter, Belgium ;Spanish Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:53 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - Doctor Music Festival)\" - 6:51 #\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (Live - Doctor Music Festival)\" - 6:41 #\"No Remorse (Live - Doctor Music Festival)\" - 5:37 * Live tracks recorded on June 21, 2003, at the Doctor Music Festival, Barcelona, Spain ;Italian Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"Blackened (Live - Imola Jammin' Festival)\" - 7:02 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - Imola Jammin' Festival)\" - 6:33 #\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (Live - Imola Jammin' Festival)\" - 7:18 #\"No Remorse (Live - Imola Jammin' Festival)\" - 5:29 * Live tracks recorded on June 13, 2003, at the Imola Jammin' Festival, Imola, Italy ;Danish Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"Blackened (Live - Roskilde Festival)\" - 8:02 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - Roskilde Festival)\" - 7:06 #\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (Live - Roskilde Festival)\" - 6:49 #\"No Remorse (Live - Roskilde Festival) - 5:33 * Live tracks recorded on June 26, 2003, at the Roskilde Festival, Roskilde, Denmark ;German Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - Rock Am Ring)\" - 6:49 #\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (Live - Rock Am Ring) - 6:58 * Live tracks recorded on June 8, 2003, at the Rock Am Ring Festival, Nurburgring, Germany ;French Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:53 #\"Blackened (Live - Le Trabendo)\" - 5:58 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - La Boule Noire)\" - 7:05 #\"Welcome Home (Saniatrium) (Live - La Boule Noire)\" - 6:44 * Recorded live on June 11, 2003, at Le Trabendo & La Boule Noire, Paris, France (Metallica played 3 gigs in Paris on that same day to celebrate the release of the St. Anger album) ;Japanese EP #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"Blackened (Live - Download Festival)\" - 6:37 #\"Harvester of Sorrow (Live - Download Festival)\" - 6:41 #\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (Live - Download Festival)\" - 6:40 #\"No Remorse (Live - Download Festival)\" - 5:16 * Live tracks recorded on June 1, 2003, at the Download Festival, Donington, UK ;International Vinyl Single #\"Frantic\" - 5:50 #\"Frantic (UNKLE Reconstruction - Artificial Confidence)\" - 6:51 ==Chart positions== Chart (2003â€“04) Peak position Croatia (HRT) 7 ==References== Category:2003 songs Category:Metallica songs",
