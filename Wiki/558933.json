 "text": "Joanne is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga. It was released on October 21, 2016. It was named for Gaga's aunt, her father's sister, who died before Gaga was born. Joanne is also Gaga's middle name. The album was produced by Gaga, Mark Ronson, Kevin Parker, and BloodPop, among other producers. Gaga collaborated with RedOne on the song \"Angel Down\", which was written about Trayvon Martin, who was killed in 2012. RedOne also helped produce Gaga's previous blockbuster hits, such as \"Just Dance\", \"Poker Face\", and \"Bad Romance\". Country songwriter Hillary Lindsey also worked with Gaga on Joanne on songs like \"Million Reasons\". Singer-songwriter Beck worked with Gaga on the dance song \"Dancin' in Circles\". Two singles were released for the album: \"Perfect Illusion\" and \"Million Reasons\". The first single reached the top 20 in several countries, like the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK. \"Million Reasons\" first peaked at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, after her Super Bowl halftime performance on February 5, 2017, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 again at number four. This is Gaga's 14th top- ten song and her 10th song to reach the top five on the chart. Gaga went on a Dive Bar Tour at three different dive bars in the United States to promote Joanne. Critics have said that Joanne is different from Gaga's previous releases, such as The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. The album sold 201,000 copies in its first week in the United States. The album entered the Billboard 200 albums chart at number one. It became Gaga's fourth number-one album in the U.S. After the album was released, Gaga became the female artist with the most number-one albums of the 2010s decade. Joanne ranked at number 108 on the Billboard 200 year-end chart of 2016 in the US. In August 2017, Gaga began the Joanne World Tour, which was set to run through December. However, in September 2017, Gaga canceled her performance at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, with Maroon 5 taking her place. The European leg of her tour was postponed to early 2018 due to severe chronic pain. She is set to continue the remainder of the North American dates. On October 22, 2017, Gaga announced that the album had been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for over one million certified units in the United States. ==Track listing== The standard version of the album has 11 songs, while the deluxe version has 14. == Certifications == Region Certification Certified units/sales United States Platinum 1,000,000‡ United Kingdom Gold 400,000‡ Canada Gold 40,000‡ * sales based on certification alone ^ shipments based on certification alone x unspecified figures based on certification alone ‡ sales+streaming figures based on certification alone ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Pop albums Category:Dance albums Category:Rock albums Category:Lady Gaga albums",
