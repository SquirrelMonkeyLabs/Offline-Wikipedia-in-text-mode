 "text": "The Acts of the Apostles (Greek Praxeis Apostolon) is a book of the Bible, which now is the fifth in the New Testament. It is often simply called Acts. Acts tells the story of the Early Christian church, with particular interest for the ministry of the Twelve Apostles and of Paul of Tarsus. The early chapters in Jerusalem, report Jesus's Resurrection, his Ascension, the Day of Pentecost, and the start of the Twelve Apostles' ministry. The later chapters report Paul's conversion, his ministry, and finally his arrest and imprisonment and trip to Rome. Most people think that the author of Acts also wrote the Gospel of Luke, as Acts 1:1 refers to 'the former treatise have I made, Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach'. The traditional view is that both the two books were written c. 60 by a companion of Paul named Luke. Many theologians still think so. But some think the books were written by an unknown author at a later date, sometime between 80 and 150. ==References== == Other websites == * Bible Gateway 35 languages/50 versionsy at GospelCom.net * Dating Acts * Unbound Bible 100+ languages/versions at Biola University * Online Bible at gospelhall.org * Book of Acts at Bible Gateway * Acts from the Biblical Resource Database * The Apostle Paul's Shipwreck: An Historical Investigation of Acts 27 and 28 * Catholic Encyclopedia: Acts of the Apostles * Encyclopedia Britannica: Acts of the Apostles * Jewish Encyclopedia: New Testament - The Acts of the Apostles * Tertullian.org: The Western Text of the Acts of the Apostles (1923) J.
