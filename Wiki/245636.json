 "text": "The team captain of a football team is a team member who is chosen to be the leader during a football match. Mostly a captain is an older or more experienced player. A team captain often wears an armband. == Tasks == The captain has to participate in the coin toss before the match and before a penalty shootout. Referees mostly talk to the captain about the behaviour of him and his team mates. When the team wins a trophy it is given to the captain. === Vice-captain === A vice-captain (or assistant captain) is a player that is expected to captain the side when the club's captain is not playing. Similarly, some clubs also name a 3rd captain, a 4th captain, or even a 5th captain to take the role of captain when both the captain and vice- captain are unavailable.
