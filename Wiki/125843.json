 "text": "The Asian black bear, also called the Asiatic black bear, White-chested bear, Moon bear, or the Himalayan black bear, (Ursus thibetanus or Selenarctos thibetanus) is a medium-sized, sharp-clawed, black-coloured bear with a distinctive white or cream \"V\" marking on its chest. It is a close relative of the American black bear with which it is thought to share a European common ancestor. It is called 반달가슴곰 (bandalgaseumgom) in Korean. Both American and Asiatic species are thought of as sister taxa. They are more closely related to one another than any other species of bear.Bears of the World by Lance Craighead, Publisher: Voyageur Press, 2003, , 9780896580084, 132 pages Asian black bears are omnivores. They feed on fruit, grass, leaves, insects, rodents, rabbits, carrion, nuts, and even deer, buffalo, and wild boar. Their predators are humans, tigers, and brown bears, while leopards, wolves, lynxes, jackals, and dholes are predators of black bear cubs. == References == Category:Bears Category:Mammals of Pakistan",
