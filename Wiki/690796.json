She studied at the University of Delaware. She had testing, including freezing the inner ear with ice water to induce vertigo. She said of the experience, \"The tests didn’t bother me at all…. When you are young you can take anything. My mind was made up: I was going to pass.\" After the Mercury 13, Gorelick became an accountant with the Internal Revenue Service. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:American aviators Category:People from Kansas",
