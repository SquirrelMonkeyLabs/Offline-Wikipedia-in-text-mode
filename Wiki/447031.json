He was known for piloting a Central Intelligence Agency U-2 spy plane which was shot down while flying a reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union. This caused the 1960 U-2 incident, and played a large role in the Cold War. Powers was held as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. On February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged in a spy swap in Berlin. The exchange was for Soviet KGB Colonel Vilyam Fisher, known as \"Rudolf Abel\", who had been caught by the FBI and tried and jailed for espionage.Famous Cases: Rudolph Ivanovich Abel (Hollow Nickel Case) .
