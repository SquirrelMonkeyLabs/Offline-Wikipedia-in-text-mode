 "text": "Tetete's tree frog (Boana tetete) is a frog that lives in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 180 and 420 meters above sea level. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It likes to sit on plants a few feet above flooded areas. It has large eyes and discs on its toes for climbing. For a South American tree frog, it is medium sized. This frog is a sister species to Boana alfaroi. The frog is named after the Tetete people, indigenous people who lived in the Amazon until about 1970. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
