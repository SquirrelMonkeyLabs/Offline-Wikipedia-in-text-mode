 "text": "\"Double Life\" is a single by the American rock band The Cars from their second album Candy-O. The song consists of an opening verse of Ric Ocasek singing lead vocals, then followed by all band members participating in a backing vocal verse with Ocasek still singing lead vocals during the entire bands verse as backing vocals at the same time. It then leads into a guitar solo, the vocal verse following the same pattern as the opening verse throughout the song. The song features a short guitar solo by lead guitarist Elliot Easton, who plays a series of high-speed solo licks over a G major musical background. Some of his solo phrases deliberately end on F, the dominant seventh of G, reinforcing its role as the dominant seventh chord.The Cars/Candy-O sheet- music book, Lido Music, Inc., selling agent Warner Bros.
