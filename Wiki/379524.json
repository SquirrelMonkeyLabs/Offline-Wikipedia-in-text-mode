 "text": "The Ventriloquist is the name of multiple fictional supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They are all enemies of the superhero Batman. The character was created by Alan Grant, John Wagner and Norm Breyfogle, first appearing in Detective Comics #583 (1988). The Ventriloquist is a gangster that usually speaks through a puppet named Scarface, which his mental illness leads him to believe is a separate person. His dissociative identity disorder allows him to commit ruthless violent crimes while maintaining a quiet and meek personality, pretending that he is simply Scarface's servant. Despite years of practice, Arnold Wesker is still unable to pronounce the letter \"B\" while throwing his voice, instead replacing it with \"G\" while fighting Batman. Following his death during Face the Face, a woman named Peyton Riley became his successor. In the New 52 continuity, Shauna Belzer became Wesker's successor. == In other media == The character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as feature movies, television series and video games. Andrew Sellon portrays a new version of the character in the television series Gotham. In the fifth season, he finds the dummy Scarface and becomes the Ventriloquist.
