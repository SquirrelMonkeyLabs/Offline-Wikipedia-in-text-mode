 "text": "Ion exchange chromatography (or ion chromatography) is a process in chromatography that separates ions and polar molecules based on their attraction to the ion exchanger. It works on almost any kind of charged moleculeâ€”including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids. The two types of ion chromatography are: \"anion-exchange\" and \"cation-exchange\" chromatography. They are used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control. Water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to moieties that are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase. The equilibrated stationary phase is made of ionizable functional groups where targeted molecules of mixtures are separated and quantified while passing through the column. A cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions, and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations. Cation exchange chromatography is used when the desired molecules to separate are cations, and anion exchange chromatography is used to separate anions.
