 "text": "The flecked leaf frog (Agalychnis psilopygion) is a frog that lives in Colombia and Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 100 and 500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in old forests. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. But because it can only live in old forests, scientists think it may suffer more from habitat loss than other frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
