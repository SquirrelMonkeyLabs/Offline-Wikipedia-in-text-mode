 "text": "The mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was increased to two years. In 1907 it was again lengthened to four years, the present duration. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation changed them to April. In 1869, however, election time was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were lengthened. In 1875, the election day was moved back to April by the city's vote to operate under the Cities and Villages Act of 1872. Lester L. Bond was the acting mayor when Joseph Medill left to a tour around Europe. Thomas Hoyne won election as mayor, but could not become the mayor so the election became a void. As of 1995, no mayor can run for a political party, they are considered as nonpartisans. ==List of mayors== # Name Term Party Notes 1 William Butler Ogden 1837–1838 Democratic 2 Buckner Stith Morris 1838–1839 Whig 3 Benjamin Wright Raymond 1839–1840 Whig 4 Alexander Loyd 1840–1841 Democratic 5 Francis Cornwall Sherman 1841–1842 Democratic 6 Benjamin Wright Raymond 1842–1843 Whig 7 Augustus Garrett 1843–1844 Democratic 8 Alson Sherman 1844–1845 Independent Democrat 9 Augustus Garrett 1845–1846 Democratic 10 John Putnam Chapin 1846–1847 Whig 11 James Curtiss 1847–1848 Democratic 12 James Hutchinson Woodworth 1848–1850 Independent Democrat 13 James Curtiss 1850–1851 Democratic 14 Walter S.
