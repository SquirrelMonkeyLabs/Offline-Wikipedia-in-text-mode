 "text": "A matross was a soldier of artillery. He was a member of an artillery (gun) crew. A matross ranked next below a gunner. The duty of a matross was to assist the gunners in loading, firing and sponging the guns. They were armed with muskets and bayonets. They marched with the store-wagons, acting as guards. In the American army a matross ranked as a private of artillery. == History == Matrosses were first used in the British Army in 1639. Before that they were called gunner's assistants. In the German language a matrose means a sailor. The work assigned to the matross was considered sailor's work on a ship. It was an effort to give the assistant a respectable title. But their pay rate remained the same. In 1873 all matrosses were promoted to the rank of gunner. The rank of matross was no longer used. A soldier's manual for artillery used by Americans in the Revolutionary war gave a detailed instruction for a matross. In part it said: By the War of 1812 an ideal gun crew could be up to 15 men.Spencer Tucker; James R. Arnold; Roberta Wiener; et al., The Encyclopedia of the War of 1812, Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC- CLIO, 2012), p. 29 Each man would have a specific task in the sequence of loading and firing the artillery piece. Often a non-commissioned officer would commanded the gun crew and aimed the gun. Like the other gun crew members, the matross had a specific place to stand as he performed his duties. == References == Category:Military ranks Category:Artillery",
