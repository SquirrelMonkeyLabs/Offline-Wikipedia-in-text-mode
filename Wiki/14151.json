 "text": "In mathematics, a product is a number or a quantity obtained by multiplying two or more numbers together. For example: 4 × 7 = 28 Here, the number 28 is called the product of 4 and 7. As another example, the product of 6 and 4 is 24, because 6 times 4 is 24. The product of two positive numbers is positive, just as the product of two negative numbers is positive as well (e.g., -6 × -4 = 24). == Pi product notation == A short way to write the product of many numbers is to use the capital Greek letter pi: \\prod. This notation (or way of writing) is in some ways similar to the Sigma notation of summation. Informally, given a sequence of numbers (or elements of a multiplicative structure with unit) say a_i we define \\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq n}a_i:=a_1\\dotsm a_n. A rigorous definition is usually given recursively as follows : \\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq n}a_i := \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{ for } n=0 , \\\\\\ \\left(\\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq n-1}a_i\\right) a_n & \\text{ for } n\\geq1 . \\end{cases} An alternative notation for \\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq n} is \\prod_{i=1}^n. === Properties === :\\prod_{i=1}^n i = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot ... \\cdot n = n! (n! is pronounced \"n factorial\" or \"factorial of n\") :\\prod_{i=1}^n x = x^n (i.e., the usual nth power operation) :\\prod_{i=1}^n n = n^n (i.e., n multiplied by itself n times) :\\prod_{i=1}^n c \\cdot i = \\prod_{i=1}^n c \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^n i = c^n \\cdot n! (where c is a constant independent of i) From the above equation, we can see that any number with an exponent can be represented by a product, though it normally is not desirable. Unlike summation, the sums of two terms cannot be separated into different sums. That is, :\\prod_{i=1}^4 (3 + 4) eq \\prod_{i=1}^4 3 + \\prod_{i=1}^4 4, This can be thought of in terms of polynomials, as one generally cannot separate terms inside them before they are raised to an exponent, but with products, this is possible: :\\prod_{i=1}^n a_ib_i=\\prod_{i=1}^na_i\\prod_{i=1}^nb_i. === Relation to Summation === The product of powers with the same base can be written as an exponential of the sum of the powers' exponents: :\\prod_{i=1}^n a^{c_i} = a^{c_1} \\cdot a^{c_2} \\dotsm a^{c_n}= a^{c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_n} = a^{(\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i)} == Related pages == * Cartesian product * Cross product * Dot product == References == Category:Arithmetics",
