 "text": "Charles Conrad Behler (born June 13, 1965) is an American musician. He played drums for the thrash metal band Megadeth from 1987 to 1989. In 1988, he was on the album So Far, So Good... So What!. He was also in the 1988 documentary The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. Behler was a roadie (person who helps a band with technical work) for Gar Samuelson, Megadeth's previous drummer. When Samuelson left the band, Behler started playing the drums for them instead. Behler was dismissed from Megadeth because he was addicted to cocaine. He was replaced by his roadie, Nick Menza. == References == Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Michigan Category:Megadeth members Category:People from Livonia, Michigan",
