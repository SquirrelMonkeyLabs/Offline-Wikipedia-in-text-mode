 "text": "Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism whereby some materials are weakly attracted by an applied magnetic field and form induced magnetic fields in the direction of the magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds. They have a relative magnetic permeability that is a little bit higher than 1. The magnetic moment caused by the applied magnetic field is linear in the field strength and weak. ==References== Category:Magnetism",
