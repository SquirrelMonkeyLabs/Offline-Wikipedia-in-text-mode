It was made of four political parties: Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), Amhara Democratic Party (ADP), Oromo Democratic Party (ODP) and Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM). After leading the overthrow of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it dominated Ethiopian politics from 1991 to 2019. In November 2019 it was dissolved, and Prime Minister and the chairman Abiy Ahmed merged three of the constituent parties (not the TPLF) into his new Prosperity Party, which was officially founded on 1 December 2019.Exclusive: Third day EPRDF EC discussing \"Prosperity Party\" Regulation.
