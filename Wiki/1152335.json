 "text": "Ameerega rubriventris is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== This frog lives in the Cordillera Azul mountains. People have seen it on dead leaves on the ground in forests where the trees are close together, both forest that has never been cut down and in forest that has been destroyed and is growing back. Scientists saw the frog between 300 and 550 meters above sea level. One of the places the frog lives is a protected park: Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Humans change the places where the frog lives. People cut down forests to make small farms to grow food, big farms to grow beautiful garden plants, to make places for cows to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. People also catch this frog to sell as a pet, even though this is against the law, but scientists do not think that is a very big problem. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
