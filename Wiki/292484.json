 "text": "King's College London (King's or KCL) is a large university in London, and a college of the federal University of London. University College London (1826) was founded before it. However, King's (1829) was the third oldest university in England to get its royal charter. In 1836 King's became, with University College, one of the two founding colleges of the University of London. King's is arranged into nine Schools of Study, spread across four Thames-side campuses in central London and one in Denmark Hill, South London. King's is one of the largest centres for graduate and post-graduate medical teaching and biomedical research in Europe. It is home to six Medical Research Council centres, the most of any British university. King's has around 18,600 full- time students and 5,030 staff and had a total income of £508 million in 2009/10, of which £144 million was from research grants and contracts. There are 12 Nobel Prize winners amongst King's alumni and former faculty. King's is ranked 5th nationally and 19th in the world in the 2015 QS World University Rankings, 7th nationally and 27th in the world in the 2015 The Times Higher Education World University Rankings and 7th nationally and 55th in the world in the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities. In September 2010, The Sunday Times selected King's as its \"University of the Year\". King's is a member of the European University Association and the Russell Group. It forms part of the 'Golden Triangle' of British universities. == References == Category:University of London Category:City of Westminster Category:1829 establishments in Europe Category:1820s establishments in England",
