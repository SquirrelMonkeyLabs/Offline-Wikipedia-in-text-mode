 "text": "Mozzarella is a kind of fresh cheese. Originally, it was Italian but now it can be found all over the world. Its made of the milk of cows or water buffalos. A cheese produced in a similar way, but with sheep's milk is common in Sardinia, Abruzzo and Lazio. It is sometimes called mozzapecora. Mozzarella made with goats milk can also be found. Its development is more recent, though. The main reason it is produced is that goats' milk is easier to digest than that of cows or buffalos. Mozzarella is common in Italian cuisine. It can be used on pizza. Mozzarella can be kept in the fridge for a few days, if it is covered in brine. Mozzarella can come in different moistures. == References == Category:Italian cheeses",
