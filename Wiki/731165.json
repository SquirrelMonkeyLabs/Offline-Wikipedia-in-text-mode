 "text": "S4C (, from the Welsh Sianel Pedwar Cymru, meaning Channel Four Wales) is a Welsh-language free-to-air television channel. It first started in 1982 in Wales only, as the fourth analogue channel (after BBC One, ITV, and BBC Two). It was the first Welsh-language television channel. The rest of the United Kingdom had Channel 4 instead. S4C did also show some Channel 4 programmes in English at first, but both channels can now be watched in Wales. S4C can be watched in all of the United Kingdom on Freeview and other services since 2010. ==References== Category:1982 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:British television channels",
