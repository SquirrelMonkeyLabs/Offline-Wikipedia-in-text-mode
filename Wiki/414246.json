 "text": "The Coptic language, otherwise referred to as Copt for short, is an Egyptian language that was spoken by many people in Egypt until at least the 17th century. Now, only a few people speak it.Coptic Encyclopedia; Egyptian began to be written using the Greek alphabet in the 1st century. The new writing system became the Coptic script, an adapted Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from the Demotic script to represent Egyptian sounds that the Greek language did not have.Demotic means \"of the people\", so \"demotic script\" means the kind of writing the ordinary people used. The two most common dialects are Sahidic and Bohairic. Coptic and Demotic Egyptian are very similar to the earlier Egyptian language, written in the hieroglyphic script. Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period. The Copts have tried to revive the language since the 19th century. == References == Category:Afroasiatic languages Category:Languages of Egypt Category:17th- century disestablishments",
