 "text": "In Christianity, a minister is a person authorized by a church, or other religious organization, to perform functions such as teaching of beliefs; leading services such as weddings, baptisms or funerals; or otherwise providing spiritual guidance to the community. The term is taken from Latin minister (\"servant\", \"attendant\").\"Etymologically, a minister is a person of 'lower' status, a 'servant'. The word goes back via Old French ministre to Latin minister 'servant, attendant', which was derived from 'minus', 'less'.\" http://www.word-origins.com/definition/minister.html ==References== Category:Christian religious occupations",
