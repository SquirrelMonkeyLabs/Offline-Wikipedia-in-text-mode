 "text": "During the Irish rebellion of 1798 (or United Irishmen Rebellion), Irish people rebelled against the rule of the British Empire in Ireland. The rebellion lasted four months, from 24 May to 24 September 1798, but was eventually defeated. The Irish suffered much greater losses than the British. On the Irish side, between 10,000 - 50,000 Irish people died. On the English side, between 500 and 2,000 did. == Participants == === The United Irishmen === A secret society called the United Irishmen (led by Wolfe Tone) were the main driving force in the rebellion. They were influenced by revolutions taking place in America and France around the time. === Republican France === The rebellion was aided by Republican France, which was anti-Catholic at the time. However, most Irish people were Catholics. Even though the British government was also anti-Catholic, most Irish Catholics thought the Crown was the lesser of two evils. For these reasons, the rebellion never gained much traction. == References == Category:History of Ireland Category:1798 Category:1790s in Europe Category:18th-century rebellions",
