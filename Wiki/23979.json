She became a leading movie star, and a style icon famous for her beauty and her bobbed hair style. In 2006, the centenary of Brooks' birth was celebrated by the release of three DVDs and three books, museum exhibits, screenings, and other events. ==Filmography== Brooks' signature movie role was as Lulu in G.W. Pabst's Pandora's Box (Die Büchse der Pandora) in 1929. Brooks' portrayal was of a young woman whose raw sexuality and uninhibited nature brings ruin to herself and those who love her.
