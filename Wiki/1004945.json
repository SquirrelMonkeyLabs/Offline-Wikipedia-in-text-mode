 "text": "The modern system of ranked Shinto shrines, is a system of ranking shinto shrines that was used in the Japanese Empire to determine how much money it gave the shtinres. It was an intrinsic part of Japanese State Shinto. This system classified Shinto shrines into two categories: official government shrines and \"other\" shrines.The official shrines were divided into #Imperial shrines (kampeisha), which are in minor, medium, or major sub-categories; and #National shrines (kokuheisha), which are similarly categorized as minor, medium, or major.Institute for Japanese Culture and Classics, Kokugakuin University: Glossary of Shinto Names and Terms, Kampei Taisha. Some shrines are the \"first shrines\" called ichinomiya that have the highest rank in their respective provinces of Japan. The Ise Grand Shrine stood at the top of all shrines and thus was outside the classification. All listed shrines on this page with the exception of Ise Grand Shrine and others noted in the notes are Beppyo shrines ==History== On May 14th, 1871, the Daijō-kan issued a decree establishing the modern shrine system. This system ranked Shinto shrines hierarchically and specified the levels of priests who could officiate at each level of shrine. However, these rankings were abolished in 1946 when they were considered \"State Shinto\" by the Occupation Shinto Directive. The Association of Shinto Shrines currently maintains a slightly different list of Special Shrines known as Beppyo shrines ==Ise Grand Shrine== name location notes Ise Grand Shrine Ise, Mie one of the Twenty-Two Shrines, Upper Seven; Outside of classification due to being first ranked ==Kan-sha== The Kan-sha system, which referred to official government shrines, had two subcategories - Kanpei-sha, also known as government shrines, and Kokuhei-sha, which were national shrines.\". ===Kanpei-sha=== In 1871, the Japanese government created the Kanpei-sha system to group Shinto shrines according to their relationship with the imperial family. The topmost category comprised of shrines that honored imperial family members, emperors, or those who served the imperial family well. These shrines were viewed as the ones most connected to the imperial family and were backed by the government... ====Imperial shrines, 1st rank==== The Kanpei-taisha were the most highly ranked shrines in Japan that were officially designated by the government. There were 67 shrines that held this status, which were closely associated with the imperial family. These shrines were considered to be of great historical and cultural significance, and were often visited by members of the imperial family as well as the general public.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.

Their status was clarified by the of the fourth day of the seventh month of 1871, in accordance with which \"Village shrines\" ranked below their respective \"District shrines\", while the smaller local shrines or Hokora ranked beneath the \"Village shrines\".
