 "text": "Opel, full name Adam Opel AG, is an automobile maker from Germany, founded in 1862. From 1929 to 2017, Opel is the German brand of the American automaker General Motors. Opel has about 35,000 workers. The company headquarters are in Rüsselsheim, Germany. Other German plants are in Eisenach and Kaiserslautern. In Great Britain, Opel cars are called Vauxhall. Opel would later engineer cars for GMDAT and GM Korea until the Opel brand was bought by PSA. From 2007 to 2009 three Opel models (the Antara, the Astra and the Vectra) were sold in the United States under the Saturn marque. Upon the discontinuation of the Saturn marque, Buick became responsible for importing the Opel models. The only Buick cars to not be Opels are the Enclave CUV and the full sized LaCrosse sedan. In March 2017, Opel and its parent brand Vauxhall were bought by PSA, the company who owns Peugeot and Citroën. 1862 == Car models == Passenger cars: Rocks-e | Astra | Corsa | Mokka | Crossland | Grandland | Zafira Commercial cars: Combo | Vivaro | Movano Concept cars: Antara GTC | Astra OPC X-Treme | Eco Speedster | Flextreme | Flextreme GT/E | Frogster | GTC Concept | GT Concept | Insignia Concept | Monza Concept | Manta GSe Electromod | RAK e | Snowtrekker | Trixx Historic cars: Adam | Antara | Ampera | Agila | Admiral | Ascona | Blitz | Calibra | Cascada | Commodore | Diplomat | Frontera | GT | Insignia | Karl | Meriva | Kadett | Kapitän | Manta | Monterey | Monza | Olympia | Omega | Rekord | Senator | Signum | Sintra | Speedster | Tigra | Vectra | Zafira Tourer == References == == Other websites == * Opel's Corporate Website Category:1862 establishments in Europe Category:1860s establishments in Germany Category:Stellantis Category:Automobile companies of Germany Category:Hesse",
