 "text": "Hersfeld-Rotenburg is a Kreis (district) in the east of Hesse, Germany. == History == In 1821 districts were created in Hesse, including the districts Hersfeld and Rotenburg, which stayed nearly unchanged after Hesse-Kassel was taken over by Prussia. In 1972 both districts were joined into one. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms is a combination of the two coat of arms of the precursor districts. The cross in the left half is taken from the old arms of the Hersfeld abbey; the linden branch is taken from the city arms of Rotenburg. ==Towns and municipalities== Towns Municipalities # Bad Hersfeld # Bebra # Heringen # Rotenburg an der Fulda # Alheim # Breitenbach am Herzberg # Cornberg # Friedewald # Hauneck # Haunetal # Hohenroda # Kirchheim 9.
