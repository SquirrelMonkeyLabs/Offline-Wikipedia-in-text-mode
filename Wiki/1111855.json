 "text": "The La Brea poison frog (Oophaga occultator) is a frog. It lives in Colombia on the west side of the Andes mountains. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in rainforests that have never been cut down, but sometimes it sits on leaves high off the ground. People have also seen it in cocoa farms near forests. People have seen this frog between 50 and 200 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground or in moss. After the eggs hatch, she carries tadpoles to bromeliad plants or palm plants that have water in their leaves in small pools. She puts the tadpoles in the water. The female frog lays eggs that will not hatch for the tadpoles to eat. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place and because people change the place where it lives to dig useful rocks out of the ground there, and because people agriculture build farms there even though it is against the law. Scientists think the frog might live in other places too, but human beings fight each other so much that the scientists cannot go to the forest to look for frogs. People might catch this frog to sell as a pet, but the fighting makes it hard to do this too. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
