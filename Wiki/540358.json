 "text": "Clarke Quay MRT Station (NE5) is an MRT Station in Singapore. It is along the North East MRT Line. ==History== The station was opened on 20 June 2003. The station has one of the lowest riderships along the North East Line, probably because it is on the wrong side of the Singapore River, and also partly due to the lack of developments surrounding the station and its proximity with Chinatown. It was formerly H4 / C4, before the opening. The station is located on the opposite side of the Singapore River where Clarke Quay is actually situated. The distance between Clarke Quay and the previous station, Chinatown, is the shortest distance between two MRT stations in Singapore, a mere 360 metres. The reverse bungee ride, the Ministry of Sound nightclub and Club MoMo are located near to the station. Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations",
