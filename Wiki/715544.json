 "text": "The hunting horn has no keys or valves. All tones and effects have to be produced using lips, cheeks, tongue and air pressure. Some tones are created by stopping the sound with the hand (“Ton Bouché”). The French hunting horn was developed around 1817. It is called the “Trompe d’Orléans”. This natural horn is tuned in the D major key and has a 3 octave range. All musicians play the same kind of instrument, only the mouthpiece can be different. The hunting horn is made of a brass alloy, and weights only 750 gr. The total length of the tube measures about 4.54 metres. Category:Brass instruments horn",
