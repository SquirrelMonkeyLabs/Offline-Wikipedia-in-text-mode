 "text": "Caning is a form of punishment that involves beating a person with a cane, usually made of rattan. Each blow of the cane is called a \"cut\" or a \"stroke\". It is most often applied to the hands or buttocks. Caning, as a form of corporal punishment, is prohibited under international law as a form of torture. In 1986 a new British law banned corporal punishment in British and Welsh public schools. The following year, the ban was extended to Scotland and Northern Ireland. Caning is still given as a punishment for breaking the law in places such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Brunei. == References == Category:Torture Category:Punishments",
