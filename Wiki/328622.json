The boy wears a 17th-century suit. The painting is large. It is 48 inches (1,200 mm) wide by 70 inches (1,800 mm) tall. The painting belonged to Jonathan Buttall until 1796. It was then sold many times. In 1921 it was sold to an art dealer. An American bought the painting from the dealer. The portrait is now in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California. Pinkie is a famous painting which hangs near it. == References == * Conisbee, Philip. The Ones That Got Away, essay from Saved! 100 Years of the National Art Collection Fund (2003, ed.
