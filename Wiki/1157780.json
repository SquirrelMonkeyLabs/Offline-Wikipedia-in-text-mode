As the wife of the President, Luz Magsaysay was active in many socio-civic programs, especially the Philippine National Red Cross where she was honorary Chairwoman for several years. She is remembered as one of the most admired First Ladies and distinguished herself for her graciousness and kindness. Magsaysay was widowed at the age of 43 when President Magsaysay died in a Douglas C-47 plane crash in 1957, three years and two months into his presidency, making it one of the shortest presidential term in Philippine history. She dedicated herself to the preservation of her husband's memory and lived an unpretentious life faithful to her husband's legacy. == Death and legacy == She died on August 17, 2004, at the age of 90. In commemoration of her memory, a Barangay in Cebu City was named Barangay Luz in the late 1960s; and Barangay Luz Banzon in the municipality of Jasaan in Misamis Oriental province, was also named in her honor. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Filipino Roman Catholics Category:People from Zambales Category:First Ladies and First Gentlemen of the Philippines",
