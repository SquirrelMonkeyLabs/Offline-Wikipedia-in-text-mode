(Ed.) (2006) The Linguistics Encyclopedia. eBook edition. London & New York: Routledge, p. 601. Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person, publication, period, or event.

Using an existing word or phrase in a new context is also called neologism.Sally Barr Ebest Writing from A to Z: the easy-to-use reference handbook 1999– Page 449 \"A neologism is a newly coined word or phrase or a new usage of an existing word or phrase.\"Lynne Bowker, Jennifer Pearson Working With Specialized Language 2002 Page 214 \"Neologisms can also be formed in another way, however, by assigning a new meaning to an existing word.\" The process of using a word in such a new context is sometimes called a semantic extension.Ole Nedergaard Thomsen Competing models of linguistic change: evolution and beyond 2006 – Page 68 \"Extensions, by contrast, are applications of extant means in new usage. Note that since individual speakers differ in their command of their shared tradition of speaking, one person's Extension may be experienced by another as a Neologism\"Michael D. Picone Anglicisms, Neologisms and Dynamic French 1996 – Page 3 \"Proceeding now to the task of defining terms, I will begin with the more general term 'neologism'. ...A neologism is any new word, morpheme or locution and any new meaning for a preexistent word, morpheme or locution that appears in a language. ...

It may also account for their use of neologisms (combining the basic components of words – syllables – in ways that seem logical to them but inappropriate to others).\" Robert D. Hare (1999), Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us. Guildford Press, p. 137 or a thought disorder, such as a psychotic mental illness, for example schizophrenia.P. J.
