 "text": "Labium (plural labia) is a Latin-derived term meaning \"Lip\". Labium and its derivatives (including labia, labial, labrum and labellum) are used to describe any lip-like structure, but in the English language, labium often specifically refers to parts of the vulva. A variant of the word, labellum (plural: labella), is used by people studying entomology and botany.Khoshoo, T.N. & Guha, I. Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Cannas.
