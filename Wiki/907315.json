 "text": "Trachycephalus is a genus of frogs. People call them casque-headed tree frogs. They are in the family Hylidae. They live in Mexico, Central America, and South America. Scientists looked at the genuses of tree frogs and decided that the seven species of frogs in the genus Phrynohyas should be in Trachycephalus instead. They also said that Phrynohyas is a synonym of (another name for) Trachycephalus., 2005: Systematic Review of the Frog Family Hylidae, with Special Reference to Hylinae: Phylogenetic Analysis and Taxonomic Revision. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Num. 294, pp.1-240. . These frogs live in the high tree branches of tropical rainforests. They lay eggs in holes in trees.
