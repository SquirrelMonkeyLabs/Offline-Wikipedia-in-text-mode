 "text": "HTML5 is the fifth revision of the HTML standard. HTML5 is no longer a standard but has been replaced by a new standard called the HTML Living Standard. This new standard is managed by a group called the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which comprises all the major web browser vendors: Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft. HTML5 was first made public on January 22, 2008, and got a major update in October 2014. The main goals of HTML5 were to - be easy to read for both people and computer and work well with older software. HTML5 also includes new tools for creating complex web applications and is good for making mobile apps because it works well on devices with low power. == References == Category:Markup languages",
