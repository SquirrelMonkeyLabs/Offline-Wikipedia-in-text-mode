On 14 April, he was officially elected.\"Nicolas Maduro Elected President\", from Sky News Chávez' funeral was held on 8 March. Maduro originally said that Chávez' body would be embalmed and permanently displayed in a glass coffin at a military museum. However, on 13 March Maduro announced that this would not happen. This was because the government could not get prepared in the short time that had passed. Maduro extended the National Mourning for four days more, to eleven days. By the end of this, Chávez' body was moved to the Museum of the Revolution at Fort Montana. This had been where Chávez had tried to overthrow the government in 1992. Chávez's body was never embalmed. He was buried at a cemetery in Venezuela. ==References== Category:21st century in Venezuela Chavez Category:2013 in South America",
