This frog lives in forests with evergreen trees in them. It lays eggs in holes in trees that have water in them, holes in bamboo that have water in them, and in small pools and ponds. People have seen this frog between 830 and 1711 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it is in some danger. The biggest one is people cutting down trees to get wood to build with. The frog lives in many protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
