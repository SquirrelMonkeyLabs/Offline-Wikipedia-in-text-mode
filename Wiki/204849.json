 "text": "Snake worship is the worshipping of snakes. The worshipping of snakes occurs in many ancient cultures. In religion and mythology, snakes were often seen as images of strength, or of renewal. In Hindu mythology, the snake (or Naga) represents rebirth, death and mortality, as the snake sheds its skin and becomes (symbolically) re-born. There are many snakes in Greek mythology - some myths feature a snake called \"ophion\" as one of the original rulers of the world. The snake is to be considered \"the god of good\" by the Gnostics. == References == Category:Snakes Category:Worship",
