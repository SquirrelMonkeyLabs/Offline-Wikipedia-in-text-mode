 "text": "John Albert Elway, Jr. (born June 28, 1960 in Port Angeles, Washington) is a retired Hall of Fame American football quarterback. He played his college football at Stanford and his whole professional career for the Denver Broncos football team of the National Football League (NFL). He was the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1987. Elway won Super Bowls with the Broncos in 1998 and 1999, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999, throwing for one touchdown and rushing for another as the Broncos beat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-19. That ended up being his final game (other than the 1999 Pro Bowl), as he retired after that season. He is famed for the fact that Homer Simpson wants to be him in the Simpsons episode “Cape Feare”, this is ironic as he lost 55-10 to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV, thus Homer should want to be Joe Montana.
