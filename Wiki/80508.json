 "text": "Adrastea or , is the second closest moon to Jupiter. It was found by David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson in Voyager 2 probe photographs taken in 1979 and received the designation .IAUC 3454: Editorial Notice 1980 February 25 (discovery) In 1983, it was named after the mythological Adrastea,IAUC 3872: Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn 1983 September 30 (naming the moon) who was a daughter of Jupiter and Ananke. Adrastea was the first moon to be found from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft, rather than through telescopic photography. == Physical characteristics == Adrastea is non-spherical and measures 20x16x14 km³ across. What Adrastea is made of and the mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86 g/cm³) its mass can be estimated at ~2×1015 kg. Amalthea's density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10-15%, and Adrastea may be similar. No surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images. == Orbit == Adrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the closer moons to Jupiter. It orbits Jupiter at ~129,000 km (1.806 Jupiter radii) within the planet's Main Ring. The orbital eccentricity of ~0.0015 and inclination of ~ 0.03° relative to the equator of Jupiter are very small. == Exploration == Adrastea was found in Voyager 1 and 2 images, but appeared only as a dot. The Galileo spacecraft was able to see its shape, but the images remain poor. == References == == Other websites == * Adrastea Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration Category:Jupiter's moons",
