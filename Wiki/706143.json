 "text": "Harper County (county code HP) is a county in the U.S. state of Kansas. In 2020, 5,485 people lived there. Its county seat is Anthony. Anthony is also the biggest city in Harper County. The county was named after Sergeant Marion Harper of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry. He died of wounds suffered near Waldron, Arkansas, in December 1863.Kansas Place-Names, John Rydjord, University of Oklahoma Press, 1972, ==History== ===19th century=== In 1867, Harper County was created. The original organization of Harper County was one of the biggest frauds in county government. In 1873, a group of three men organized Harper County. They designated the then-fake city of \"Bluff City\" as the county seat. The petition for organization used many names from a Cincinnati city directory to represent as residents of Harper County. In 1874, the state attorney general investigated. He didn't find any resident of the county. The \"creators\" of the county had sold $40,000 worth of bonds. ===21st century=== Due to new and high-paying jobs at oil fields and wind farms, Harper County had an economic boom. In 2012, rental housing and office space in towns such as Danville, Harper, and Anthony had become four times more expensive. However, by 2016, the oil fracking boom had ended. The economies of Harper County were hurt.Downward flow's ripples: Oil, gas downturn hitting counties on many levels, Kansas Agland, Amy Bickel, Feb 13, 2016.
