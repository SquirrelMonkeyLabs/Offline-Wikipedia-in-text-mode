Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte, and Jos√©phine de Beauharnais all owned Pomeranians.Pomeranians are sometimes called Zwergspitz (which is a Dwarf Spitz) and Toy German Spitz in different countries. The Pomeranian can live from 12 to 16 years. Pomeranians are more likely than other dogs to get some health problems, like: * Luxating patella (where the kneecap dislocates, or slips out of place) * Tracheal collapse (collapse of the tube that brings air to the lungs and makes breathing possible) ==Other websites== Category:Dog breeds originating in Germany Category:FCI breeds Category:Dog breeds",
