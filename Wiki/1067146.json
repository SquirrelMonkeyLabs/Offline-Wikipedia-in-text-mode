 "text": "Moda Center is an multi-use arena located in Portland, Oregon that serves as the home for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). It was also home to the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1995 until 2021 and the Portland Fire of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 2000 until 2002. They first started to build the stadium on July 12, 1993. The arena opened on October 12, 1995 and the first event was a concert by David Bowie opened by Nine Inch Nails on October 25. The Trail Blazers had their first game in the arena on November 3, 1995. In the game, they were defeated by the Vancouver Grizzlies 92â€“80. When the arena first opened on October 12, 1995, the arena didn't have a sponsor and the arena was named the Rose Garden. The name was chosen because of Portland's nickname being the Rose City. In 2004, the arena was filed for bankruptcy and the ownership of the arena moved from Paul Allen to many different creditors. When the creditors owned the arena for two years, the arena and the Trail Blazers were put up for sale during the spring of 2006. It would later be pulled from the market. On August 13, 2013, Moda Health purchased the naming rights for the arena and renamed it to the Moda Center. WWE has also hosted many shows and pay-per-views at the arena including Unforgiven in 2004, No Mercy in 2008 and NXT TakeOver: Portland in 2020. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Buildings and structures in Oregon",
