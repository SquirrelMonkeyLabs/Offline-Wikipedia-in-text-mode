It borders the provinces of Florida and Manuel María Caballero. == History == During colonial times, communications between Charcas and Santa Cruz were very dangerous due to the presence of chiriguano Indians. This is the reason why the viceroy of Lima decided to populate the area to maintain communications. It was founded by Pedro Lucio Escalante y Mendoza on March 30 in 1612. == References == Category:Cities in Bolivia Category:Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)",
