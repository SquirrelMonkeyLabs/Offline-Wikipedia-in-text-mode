 "text": "The Battle of Bakhmut is an ongoing series of battles in and near the city of Bakhmut. It is being fought between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Russian Armed Forces. It is part of the Battle of Donbas. Shelling of Bakhmut started in May 2022. The main attack on the city started on 1 August. It started after Russian soldiers moved in from Popasna after the Ukrainians left the city. The main attack force is mostly made of mercenaries from the Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group. The attack force also has regular Russian troops and DPR and LPR separatist soldiers. As of late 2022, the Bakhmut front became the center of the war. It is one of the few front lines in Ukraine where Russia stayed on the attack. Attacks on the city grew stronger in November 2022. Attacking Russian forces were made stronger by units from the Kherson front and newly mobilized recruits. By this time, much of the fighting on the front line became trench warfare. Both sides have taken many casualties. == Background == Bakhmut was where the 2014 battle of Artemivsk was fought. This battle was fought between Ukraine and the separatist Donetsk People's Republic. Pro-Russian separatists had taken parts of the city during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. A Ukrainian special forces unit and the National Guard were sent to get rid of the separatists from the city. The separatists were sent to the city's outskirts. Small battles continued until July 2014, when the separatists retreated from the area. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a main Russian goal was to take the Donbas region. This region is made of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The first attack to Bakhmut was done to encircle the Ukrainian soldiers at the Sievierodonetsk- Lysychansk salient. With another push from the Lyman direction, this would create a pocket and trap Ukrainian forces there. After the battles of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in early July, Russian and separatist forces took all of Luhansk Oblast. The battlefield turned towards the cities of Sloviansk, Bakhmut, and Soledar. Starting on 17 May, Russian forces began bombarding Bakhmut. This killed five people including a two-year-old child. After the fall of Popasna on 22 May, Ukrainian forces left the city to help soldiers at Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Russian forces moved forward on the Bakhmut- Lysychansk highway. This put the remaining Ukrainian troops in the Lysychansk- Sievierodonetsk area in danger. The Russian checkpoint on the highway was later destroyed. Fighting continued on 30 May on the Kostiantynivka-Bakhmut highway. Ukrainian forces were able to defend the highway. Bombardment of Bakhmut continued throughout the rest of June and July. On 25 July, Ukrainian forces left the Vuhlehirska Power Station and the nearby town of Novoluhanske. Two days later on 27 July, Russian bombardment of Bakhmut killed three civilians and wounded three more. ==Battle== === August–October 2022 === On 1 August, Russian forces attacked many settlements south and southeast of Bakhmut. Both the Russian Ministry of Defense and pro-Russian Telegram pages said that the battle of Bakhmut had started.

The local fire department was also bombarded as they put out the fire. It reported that two SES staff were injured and equipment was damaged. At night, a five-story building was damaged by Russian bombardment. A Russian missile strike destroyed the main bridge across the Bakhmutka river on 22 September. This delayed civilian travel and Ukrainian military logistics. On 7 October, Russian forces moved into the villages of Zaitseve and Opytne on the southern and southeastern outskirts of Bakhmut. On 10 October, the UK Defence Ministry said that Russian soldiers moved closer to Bakhmut.
