It was founded on 6 April 2016 by Emmanuel Macron, a former Minister of Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs, who was later elected President of France in the 2017 presidential election by a landslide 66.1% of the second-round vote. The party ran candidates in the 2017 legislative elections as La République en marche (English translation: \"The Republic Onwards!\"), including members of the Democratic Movement, as well as dissidents from the Socialist Party, The Republicans and minor parties. It won an absolute majority of seats in the National Assembly, securing 308 under its label and 42 for the MoDem. In 2022, Macron's Ensemble coalition won the most seats, 250, in the National Assembly but also lost majority control, causing a hung parliament. ==References== Category:2016 establishments in France Category:Political parties in France Category:Liberal parties",
