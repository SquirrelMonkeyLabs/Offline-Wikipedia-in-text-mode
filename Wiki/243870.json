 "text": "The second Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament (known as the Gillette Tri- Nations due to sponsorship) was played between 16 October and 27 November of 2004. The format of the competition was different from the previous event. In that event the teams played each other twice instead of once before the final. The tournament final of the tournament was predicted by some to be a close affair. The British team was considered a small favourite after finishing at the top of the league table. Instead, it was a one-sided match as Australia produced their best performance of the tournament. The game was basically over by half-time when Australia led by 38-0. ==Results== ===Tournament matches=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Tournament standings=== Team Played Won Drew Lost For Against Difference Points 4 3 0 1 80 60 +20 6 4 2 1 1 72 60 +12 5 4 0 1 3 64 95 âˆ’32 1 ===Final=== ===Non-series Tests=== During the series, Australia and New Zealand played additional Tests against France. \\---- ===Additional Matches=== A one off match was also played between an ANZAC side made up of touring Australian and New Zealand players and a Cumbira side.Three-Try Heroes Whitehaven News, 29 October 2004.
