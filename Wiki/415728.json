 "text": "The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) is a part of the African National Congress for younger people. It was founded in 1944 by Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. They created the foundation to put an end to apartheid in Africa. The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was established on 2 April 1944, by Anton Lambede (who became the League’s first President), Nelson Mandela, Ashby Mda, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo. They were joined by, Duma Nokwe, B Masekela, Ida Mtwa, Lillian Ngoyi, James Njongweni, William Nkomo and Dan Tloome. The aim of the Youth League was to push the ANC away from the then South African version of Communism, towards its founding ideology which was Africanism. At the time the ANCYL was established, political circumstances in South Africa were tenuous as the ruling United Party was divided about South Africa’s participation in World War II. Four years after the establishment of the Youth League, the United Party’s rule came to an end and the country was subsequently governed by the National Party. ==Former leaders== * Fikile Mbalula * Julius Malema ==References== Category:Nationalist organizations in South Africa Category:Nelson Mandela Category:Youth organizations Category:1944 establishments Category:1940s establishments in Africa Category:20th-century establishments in South Africa",
