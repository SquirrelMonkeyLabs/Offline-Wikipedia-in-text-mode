 "text": "Self-bondage is the name for a number of techniques people use to restrain themselves. Much like bondage, this is done for sexual arousal. With bondage, people use tools and materials to restrain another person, usually their partner. While there are certain risks associated with bondage in general, these risks are bigger with self-bondage. People do self-bondage alone. People who are doing self-bondage either seek this higher risk, or they want to have to use more uncommon ways of restraining, which are often required when people bind themselves without a partner. ==Self bondage is different== Self-bondage is much like bondage, in many ways: * The risks are higher, if something goes wrong, there's no partner who can help * The tools used need to have a secure way of releasing the bondage,. Usually, this is done after a given amount of time. * There need to be materials, and techniques of restraining oneself. ==Types== There are two very basic types of self-bondage: * Sensual self- bondage focuses on the feeling. Usually, release is easy, as the keys to the handcuffs are close by, or the knots are done in ways that undoing them is easy * Strict self-bondage means that the means of escape are not easily available. The release wil only be done after the given amount of time elapses. Category:BDSM",
