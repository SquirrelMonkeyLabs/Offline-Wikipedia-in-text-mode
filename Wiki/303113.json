As of December 2008, he is the founder and singer in the band Falling in Reverse. == History == Ronald Joseph Radke was born on December 15, 1985 at Saint Rose Hospital, Las Vegas, Nevada. He has Native American ancestry. His mother left him at a very young age, but later in life he was able to meet her. She was working as a dog groomer at this point. She ended up leaving him again due to her troubles with addiction. He was raised by his father who also had a drug problem but later became a born again Christian, and sober. Around this time his father also became the president of a motorcycle club. Radke grew up very poor. Focusing was a struggle for him during school. He often wore girls' jeans with his friend Mich because his favorite skateboarders wore similar clothes. Ronald has stated that he got them mostly from girls' houses. He learned to skateboard, and he can still ride to this day. In high school, he was bullied by the kids for his unique style of wearing tight clothes and very small shirts. Despite this he also got along with some of his classmates because of his interest in rapping. Radke dropped out of high school twice. Radke started forming bands during his high school years. His first band was called 3.0. The logo of this band was made in Microsoft Paint and resembled the Ninja Turtles logo. His second band, named Lefty (with Robert Ortiz), competed in the high school talent contest. While on stage, Radke's microphone fell and Max Green (who was in a band called Almost Heroes at the time) picked it up for him and they almost instantly became friends. Together, they formed a band called True Story. Their interest shifted out of the pop punk scene and got into bands like Trice. Radke started playing piano and guitar. He played left-handed guitar, but still played a normal right-handed guitar when he played Blink 182 songs. At age 21, Radke along with Max Green founded the band Escape the Fate. He made two albums with the band and two EPs. The more popular was Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, it was released September 26, 2006. In late 2008 Radke left Escape the Fate. Radke then founded the band Falling in Reverse and continues to make music. He has several lead singles from the album The Drug In Me is You released. == Discography == With Escape the Fate * Escape the Fate (Demo, 2005) * There's No Sympathy For The Dead (EP, 2006) * Dying Is Your Latest Fashion (Studio album, 2006) * Situations (EP, 2007) With Falling in Reverse * The Drug In Me Is You (Studio album, 2011) * Fashionably Late (Studio Album, 2013) *Just Like You (Studio Album, 2015) *Coming Home (Studio Album, 2017) ==References== *http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2008/01/escape_the_fate_singer_escapes.html *http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2008/08/escape_the_fate_cancel_uk_tour.html *http://www.fallinginreverse.com.br/2012/02/ronnie-radke-fala-sobre-saida-da- prisao.html *http://www.punknews.org/article/42949/ronnie-radke-returns-with- falling-in-reverse *http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID;=159159 *http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/groupe-groupe-Falling_In_Reverse-l-en.html *http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/exclusive_ronnie_radke_interview_falling_in_reverse_drug_me_you Category:Singers from Las Vegas Category:1983 births Category:Living people",
