 "text": "Top of the Pops is a British music show, which featured popular artists performing their songs. It started in 1964 and ended in 2006 because not enough people were watching it any more. It was hosted by many presenters over the years, most notably by Jimmy Savile, who opened the very first show on New Year's Day 1964 on BBC1. TOTP2 (Top of the Pops 2) is a variant of the show. However, it featured a collection of archive performances by artists spanning the past four decades. The show was regularly hosted by Steve Wright, up until 2009, when Mark Radcliffe replaced him. A new episode of the programme is shown on 25 December each year. == References == == Other websites == * Category:1964 British television series debuts Category:1960s British television series Category:1970s British television series Category:1980s British television series Category:1990s British television series Category:2000s British television series Category:BBC Television programmes Category:Music television series Category:1964 in music Category:CBS network shows Category:English-language television programs",
