 "text": "De Colores is a common folk song in the Spanish-speaking world. Today, it is the anthem of the United Farm Workers movement. ==History== No one knows for sure when the song first began to be sung in the Americas. The melody is thought to have been used in North and South America since the 16th century, having been brought over from Spain in the colonial era. However, the version of the lyrics sung today is thought to have been created by a group of Cursillo participants in Majorca, Spain, after one of the earliest Cursillo retreats in the 1940s. Today, in addition to being used as the unofficial anthem of the United Farm Workers movement, and as an inspirational song in Cursillo workshops, the song is often taught in schools in the United States—from elementary school to community colleges—as an example of a common American folk song. It often appears in collections of children's songs. ==Common song words== De colores is usually sung in Spanish, but there are different English translations of the song. The song has also been translated into other languages. The lyrics depict an expression of joy and a celebration of all creation with its many bright colors. Below are four of the most commonly heard verses. Many additional verses (and variations of these verses) are known to exist, some including Christian references and some including more specific to farm life or labor union issues to be used as a rallying-song for farm-laborers. Spanish Version: De colores, de colores Se visten los campos en la primavera. De colores, de colores Son los pajaritos que vienen de afuera. De colores, de colores Es el arco iris que vemos lucir. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí. De colores, de colores Brillantes y finos se viste la aurora. De colores, de colores Son los mil reflejos que el sol atesora. De colores, de colores Se viste el diamante que vemos lucir. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí. Canta el gallo, canta el gallo Con el quiri, quiri, quiri, quiri, quiri. La gallina, la gallina Con el cara, cara, cara, cara, cara. Los pollitos/polluelos, los pollitos/polluelos Con el pío, pío, pío, pío, pí. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí. Jubilosos, jubilosos Vivamos en gracia puesto que se puede. Saciaremos, saciaremos La sed ardorosa del Rey que no muere. Jubilosos, jubilosos Llevemos a Cristo un alma y mil más. Difundiendo la luz que ilumina La gracia divina del gran ideal. Difundiendo la luz que ilumina La gracia divina del gran ideal. De colores, de colores Sí, de blanco y negro y rojo y azul y castaño. Son colores, son colores De gente que ríe, y estrecha la mano. Son colores, son colores De gente que sabe de la libertad. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí. Y por eso los grandes amores De muchos colores me gustan a mí.
