 "text": "Airsoft is a competitive team shooting sport in which players use fake guns, usually replicas of real firearms, to eliminate opponents from play using spherical plastic projectiles, called BBs. Airsoft is comparable to paintball, another sport that uses fake guns to battle. The main differences between the two sports are: #Projectiles from an Airsoft gun are plastic BBs, not paint, and do not break or leave a marker upon impact. Although, the solid projectiles can sometimes leave a small bruise or wound. Players use their own judgement to call themselves out. This system is based on honor, because people can cheat by not calling themselves out without the knowledge of other players. This has led to fights between players usually resulting in one repeatedly shooting a cheater, causing pain, until they call their hit. #Airsoft guns are more commonly replicas of real firearms, with Airsoft guns more commonly using magazines simulating the appearance of a real one (albeit functioning differently) opposed to a dropper used on paintball guns. #Airsoft guns are commonly powered by a battery or small disposable CO2 gas tanks, opposed to reusable tanks used in paintball. #Airsoft is arguably cheaper, Airsoft guns can cost as low as around $5, and BBs costing less than 2 cents per BB. The appeal of Airsoft stems from real world battle tactics and gameplay styles. Some examples are short-term battles, organized scenarios, historical reenactments and Military Simulation. Game fields also have very different styles, from small indoor arenas to large fields. Category:Sports",
