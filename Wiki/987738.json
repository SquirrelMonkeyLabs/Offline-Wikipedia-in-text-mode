 "text": "Macadam is a type of road making. It was invented by the Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam, about 1820. He put crushed stone in shallow, convex layers and compacted thoroughly (squashed it down). Sometimes a layer of stone dust was covered with a cement or bitumin. This keeps the dust and stones together. Macadam's ideas were built on the ideas of some earlier road engineers, like Tr√©saguet and Thomas Telford. The Romans had not used a binding substance like bitumen. Their roads were nevertheless quite long-lasting. Category:Roads Category:British engineers Category:Scottish inventors",
