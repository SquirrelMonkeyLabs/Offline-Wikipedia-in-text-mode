Miller) is a stereotypical jock. He plays the drums in the gang's band. Brad is passive aggressive, with mostly good intentions. He acts like a bully, though he denies it if someone said he actually is. His victim is Blackstein, who he calls \"Brainstein\" with the intent of irony. * Cassandra Barren (voiced by Mandy Moore) is a spoiled 16-year-old girl. She lives with her adopted parents who are very old. She is always horny and seems to be rather shallow and mean spirited at times but has shown that she does care for her friends, she also appears to have no style of her own and often copies people. As revealed in Episode 5, Cassandra was actually adopted from China, but her original parents were American factory workers who gave Cassandra plastic surgery to appear Asian so she would be adopted faster. * Lamort Blackstein (voiced by Nathan Barnatt) is a stereotypical nerd and he has a Lisp voiced. He is commonly known as just \"Blackstein\". He is very easy to bully, and Brad frequently calls him \"Brainstein\" with ironic intent. == Episodes == == References == Category:Adult animated television series Category:English-language television programs Category:Fox television series Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2015 American television series endings",
