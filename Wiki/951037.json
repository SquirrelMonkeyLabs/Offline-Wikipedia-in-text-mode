Accessed February 10, 2021. \"Syd Cassyd, whose idea it was to found the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which gives the Emmy Awards, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles.... Mr. Cassyd was working for a trade publication when he had the idea, and in 1946 he organized a meeting of influential figures in the world of television. He believed that television, then in its infancy, had the potential for enormous growth, so the purpose of the 1946 gathering was to talk about creating an organization like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had been giving the Academy Awards, known as Oscars, since 1927.\" It presents the Primetime Emmy Awards. ==References== Category:Non- profit organizations of the United States",
