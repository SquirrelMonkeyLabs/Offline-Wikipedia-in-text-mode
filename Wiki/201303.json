Many scientists use the scientific method for their research. Hypotheses are to be explained and tested only by reference to natural causes and events.Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism: clarifying the connection. Barbara Forrest 2000. Retrieved 2007-05-20. Explanations for observations are only useful when they are based on hypotheses of natural causes. An explanation that relies on a natural mechanism that works according to certain rules is usable. Explanations that need miracles to work are not. Methodological naturalism is the principle underlying all of modern science. Some philosophers extend this idea, so that it applies to all of philosophy as well. Science and philosophy, according to this view, are said to form a continuum. W.V. Quine, George Santayana, and other philosophers have advocated this view.
