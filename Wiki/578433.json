Wauer, , Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kinder- und Jugendmedizin e.V.

She fled Nazi persecution and immigrated to the United States in 1938, where she completed her education in medicine. In the early 1950s, as a result of an investigation of her and her husband for un-American activities, she left the United States and eventually, after staying in Vienna for a year, moved to the GDR (East Germany). She became the first chair of neonatology in whole Germany and retired in 1973. She was a member of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany. ==Honors and awards== In East Germany, Rapoport received Habilitation in 1959. She was awarded the National Prize of East Germany as well as other awards. As a pediatrician, she helped to considerably reduce infant mortality in East Germany, which, during her active years was even lower than in West Germany.Einflussfaktoren auf das Geschlechtsverhältnis der Neugeborenen unter besonderer Betrachtung der Wirkung ionisierender Strahlung, see fig. 2; Retrieved on 13 May 2016.
