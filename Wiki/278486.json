 "text": "Rincah, is a small island near Komodo island, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. The island is famous for giant lizards called Komodo dragons. Rincah also has many other animals such as wild pigs, buffalos, and birds. The island may also be called Rinca and Rindja. Rincah is less popular than Komodo Island, so it is an excellent place to see the Komodo Dragon in nature with fewer people around. Day trips can be arranged from Labuanbajo on Flores by small boat at the park headquarters. ==Related pages== * Komodo National Park Category:Islands of Indonesia Category:East Nusa Tenggara",
