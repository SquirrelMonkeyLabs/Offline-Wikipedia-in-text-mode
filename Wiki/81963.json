 "text": "In photography, a telephoto lens is a lens. There are two different uses of the word. The less specific use is to mean a lens that has a longer focal length than a normal lens. Their angle of view is smaller than that of a normal lens. With telephoto lenses things look closer than they really are. The other meaning of telephoto lens applies to lenses that are constructed in a special way so they can be shorter than their focal length. For 35 mm film, 50 mm is a normal focal length. Typical telephoto lenses are 85 mm (28°50') and 100 mm (24°). They are used for portraits mostly. Other telephoto lenses that are used often are 135 mm (18°), 180 mm and 200 mm. Many are zoom lenses. Longer focal lengths (300 to 1200 mm) are used in sports and nature photography. ==Different focal lengths== Effect of different focal lengths on photographs taken from the same place: Image:Angleofview 28mm f4.jpg|28 mm Image:Angleofview 50mm f4.jpg|50 mm Image:Angleofview 70mm f4.jpg|70 mm Image:Angleofview 210mm f4.jpg|210 mm The above photos were taken using a 35 mm camera, using lenses of the given focal lengths.
