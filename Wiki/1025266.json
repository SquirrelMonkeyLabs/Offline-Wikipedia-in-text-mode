 "text": "Information design is about presenting information in a way that is easy to understand and efficient. It focuses on effective communication rather than just making things look attractive. It is closely related to graphic design and data visualization and is often taught in design courses.Per Mollerup, Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections, Bloomsbury Academic, 2015 The term \"information design\" emerged in the 1970s and gained recognition through publications and organizations dedicated to the field. It involves organizing and structuring information for specific audiences. It can be applied on different scales, from organizing large manuals to designing individual pages. Information design also overlaps with information architecture, which focuses on organizing and structuring information systems. Early examples of information design include William Playfair's charts on trade, John Snow's maps of a cholera outbreak, and Charles Joseph Minard's diagram of Napoleon's campaign. These examples effectively conveyed information visually and are considered important milestones in the field. In simple terms, information design helps us present information in a clear and organized way so that it is easy to understand. It involves organizing content, choosing the right visuals, and creating a structure that makes sense to the intended audience. Information design has a long history and has played a significant role in visualizing data and telling stories effectively. == References == Category:Design",
