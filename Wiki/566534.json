 "text": "thumb|right|150px| A leg-of-mutton sail (LOM) is a simple triangular sail set on a long spar mounted horizontally on the mast.A. Hyatt Verrill, The book of the sailboat: How to rig, sail and handle small boats (New York; London: D. Appleton and Co., 1916), p. 40 It runs in a fore-and-aft direction. The leg- of-mutton uses a spar mounted high instead of a boom. This gives the helmsman more visibility and there is no boom to hit his or her head on. It is a favorite type of sail for small boats. These include puddle ducks and canoes. A LOM is very similar to a spritsail. But instead of being square or having four corners, the LOM has three. Instead of the spar being mounted diagonally, as with the spritsail, it is mounted horizontally. == References == == Other websites == * Leg-of-mutton sail; YouTube Category:Sailing",
