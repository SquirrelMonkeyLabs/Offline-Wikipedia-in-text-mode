 "text": "Mike Hughes (February 9, 1956 – February 22, 2020), popularly known as \"Mad\" Mike Hughes, was an American limousine driver, daredevil, and flat Earth conspiracy theorist. He was known for flying in self-built steam rockets. Hughes planned to launch himself in a rocket on August 10, 2019, but mechanical troubles postponed the launch. The following weekend, the launch was again postponed and Hughes was treated for heat exhaustion. Hughes was killed while filming a rocket stunt for an upcoming Science Channel television series on February 22, 2020. He was riding a rocket near Barstow, California when the rocket’s parachute appeared to deploy early and detach from the craft. He was 64 years old. ==References== ==Other websites== * Fox News interview, July 2019 Category:1956 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:Stunt performers Category:Entertainers from California",
