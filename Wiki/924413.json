 "text": "Jovita Idár Vivero (September 7, 1885 – June 15, 1946) was a Mexican American teacher, writer, and activist. She fought for the right to education, the right for women to vote, and for the rights of Mexican-Americans. She became a teacher in 1903 but quit to write for La Crónica (a newspaper owned by her father). In October, 1911 she founded La Liga Feminil Mexicaista (the League of Mexican Women). The League of Mexican Women allowed Mexican-American students get access to education. In 1914, she wrote an editorial in El Progreso (The Progress) newspaper which criticized the US army interfering in the Mexican Revolution. She also wrote an editorial supporting women's suffrage. The Texas Rangers tried to shut the newspaper down, but when they came to El Progreso’s office, Jovita Idár stood in the doorway so they had to turn back. The officers shut it down the next day when she was not there. However, she continued to use La Crónica to voice her opinions. Eventually, she and her brothers took it over. For the rest of her life, she used the freedom of the press to keep arguing for civil rights. == References == Category:1885 births Category:1946 deaths Category:American activists Category:People from Laredo, Texas",
