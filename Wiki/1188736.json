 "text": "Woodland Mall is an indoor shopping mall located in Kentwood, Michigan, a suburb of Grand Rapids. The mall has JCPenney, Macy's, and Von Maur stores. It also has a Phoenix Theatres cinema. The mall has been owned by PREIT since 2006. It was owned by Taubman Centers before this. == History == Woodland Mall opened in 1968. The mall had a Sears, JCPenney and Kresge dime store. Another mall, Eastbrook Mall (now Centerpointe Mall), is located across East Beltine. The mall grew in 1975 with a new Hudson's store. After Kresge closed in 1987, the space was given to small stores. In the late 1990s Woodland Mall made improvements to its style. This included new flooring, curved ceilings, better lighting and d√©cor as well as modernized entrances. In 1997, Lord &amp; Taylor tried to move in as a fourth anchor store. However, Hudson's tried to sue the mall, saying it had power over adding new anchor stores, and Lord & Taylor was never built. A food court (Cafes in the Woods) was built next to JCPenney in 1999 as well as a play area near Sears. Also in 1999, RiverTown Crossings opened in Grandville. RiverTown Crossings became competition for Woodland Mall because before the new mall opened, Woodland was the only super-regional mall in Metro Grand Rapids. Hudson's converted to Marshall Field's in 2001 and then to Macy's in 2006 after various acquisitions. A 14-screen movie theater (then owned by Cinemark), a Red Robin and On the Border restaurant were added to the mall in 2006. Celebration Cinema bought the movie theater a year later. Barnes & Noble moved from a nearby store to a new location at the mall in 2008. It opened as a two-story bookstore a year later. In 2013 H&M; opened its first location in Michigan outside of Metro Detroit. In 2017, Sears closed all of its stores and the Sears wing was demolished. Von Maur was built as a replacement and opened on October 12, 2019. On May 17, 2019, a REI store opened in the parking lot. In 2024, a Main Event Entertainment center, in a new building near Von Maur, and a Lego store opened to the public. == References == Category:Coordinates on Wikidata Category:Pages using gadget WikiMiniAtlas Category:Infobox mapframe without OSM relation ID on Wikidata",
