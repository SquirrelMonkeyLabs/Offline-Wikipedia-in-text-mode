 "text": "The Ferrari FXX was a beast on the track because of the roaring 65Â° V12 engine which produced a devastating amount of 800 hp at 8,500 rpm which had a total displacement of 6262.45cc this insane engine helped the Ferrari FXX reach a magnificent top speed of 345 km/h the bodywork frame of the FXX had a carbon- fibre and Nomex honeycomb with front and rear aluminium structures and independent push rod suspension and including a carbon ceramic brake and a Ferrari Formula 1 inspired electro hydraulic 6 speed transmission.The FXX\" body type was two seater berlinetta and it\"s length was 4832mm and it\"s width was 2040 and a height of 1127mm the FXX\"s wheelbase was 2650mm and it only weights 1155kg which is insane since the FXX was 800hp and its only 1155 kg which makes it a monster on track.",
