 "text": "A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. Depending on the type of van, it can be bigger or smaller than a pickup truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car but relatively smaller than a truck/lorry or a bus. Panel vans (vans whose cargo space has no side windows) are used for deliveries and carrying goods. These usually have large cargo space and few windows. A van which is used to carry people is often called a minibus. It can usually carry many people, sometimes up to a total of 15. Many companies make vans, including Chevrolet, Daihatsu, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, GMC, Honda, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen. You may usually drive a van with the same driver's license as an ordinary car, but the heaviest and largest vans may require a truck licence. == List of van models == ==Minivan== A minivan is smaller and usually carries up to three people (like in hatchbacks, station wagons, and SUVs. ==Related pages== * Ambulance * Pickup truck * Truck",
