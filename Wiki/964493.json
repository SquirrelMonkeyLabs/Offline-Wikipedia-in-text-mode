 "text": "Temple Fay (Seattle , January 9, 1895 - March 7, 1963 ) was an American neurologist, professor and director of the department of neurosurgery at Temple University Medical School. He is a pioneer in therapeutic hypothermia, the use of cold for medical benefit, and he invented the first human refrigeration device. The device is on display at both the Smithsonian Museum and the British Museum. Fay argued that body temperature played an important role in some diseases, like cancer. Treating patients with end-stage cancer, he found that most patients showed positive results if he cooled their body temperatures. These patients' mortality rates were low. Modern techniques to induce therapeutic hypothermia are based on the cooling method Fay developed. He also created \"neurological reorganization\", a method of rehabilitation for individuals with brain injuries (including damage from a stroke) or neurological disorders. Its goal is to help the brain adapt to an injury by forming new connections within the brain. == References == Category:1895 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Neurologists Category:American physicians",
