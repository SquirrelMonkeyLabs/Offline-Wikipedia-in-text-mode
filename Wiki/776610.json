 "text": "The Swedish sj-sound is represented by [ɧ] in the IPA. It is most commonly spelled with Sj. Sk is the next most iconic spelling, but only occurs before e, i, y, ä, or ö. The spelling xj only occurs in the place name Växjö [vɛːkɧœː]. X is a combination of K and S, so Xj is basically \"Ksj.\" Category:Linguistics",
