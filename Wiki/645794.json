 "text": "A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine.A Dictionary of Aviation, David W. Wragg. , 1st Edition Published by Osprey, 1973 / Published by Frederick Fell, Inc., NY, 1974 (1st American Edition.), Page 141. The simplest form has three main parts: * A rotating gas compressor (SP in the diagram) to compress air * A combustion chamber, called a combustor (KS in the diagram) where fuel is injected * A turbine (TG in the diagram) on the same shaft as the compressor The diagram shows a single-shaft gas turbine. One turbine drives both the compressor and the load, such as an electric generator. There are also two-shaft gas turbines, with separate turbines to drive the compressor and the load. Two- shaft turbines are better for driving road and rail vehicles because they can give more torque at low speed. ==Related pages== * Turbojet ==References== == Other websites == *http://www.gasturbineworld.co.uk/rovergasturbine.html *https://netl.doe.gov/sites/default/files/gas-turbine-handbook/1-1.pdf *https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_240372.pdf *https://freikolben.ch/en/gas-turbines *https://www.monografias.com/trabajos108/estudio-del-efecto-del-aislamiento- termico-turbina-gas/estudio-del-efecto-del-aislamiento-termico-turbina-gas *https://chemicalengineeringworld.com/gas-turbine-working-and-types/ *https://raigap.livejournal.com/1044444.html Category:Motors",
