 "text": "The Dzungar genocide () was the killing of the Mongol Dzungar people by the Qing dynasty. The Qianlong Emperor started the genocide in 1755. The emperor started the genocide because the Dzungar leader Amursana started a rebellion against Qing rule. The genocide was started by Manchu generals of the Qing army. The genocide was supported by the \"Turkic oasis dwellers\" (now called the Uyghurs) . The Dzungar Khanate was a group of many Tibetan Buddhist Oirat Mongol tribes. These tribes formed in the early 17th century. They were the last great nomadic empire in Asia. Some scholars say that 80% of the Dzungar population(500,000 to 800,000 people) were killed from war or disease from the Qing conquest in 1755â€“1757. After the genocide, the Qing government then put Han, Hui, Uyghur, and Sibe people on state farms in Dzungaria. ==References== === Citations === === Sources === * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1755 establishments Category:18th-century establishments in China Category:1750s Category:18th century in China Category:Genocides in Asia Category:History of China Category:Massacres in Asia Category:Military history Category:18th-century disestablishments in Asia",
