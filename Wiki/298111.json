 "text": "Mohammed Jamil Hanifi (born 27 June 1935 in Kabul, Afghanistan) is a writer of several books. Hanifi got his Master's degree from Michigan State University. He got his Doctor of Philosophy from Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. In 1981, Southern Illinois University staff learned that Hanifi copied a lot of his PhD dissertation (and a book based on it) from two other works that were not his. At the time, Hanifi was a professor at Northern Illinois University. Hanifi resigned from his position at that university.http://www.rbs2.com/plag.pdf, pp. 66-67 ==References== Category:Living people Category:1935 births",
