(n.d.) American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition. (2011). Accessed on The Free Dictionary. Retrieved on 2015-05-18. The reef triggerfish is found at reefs in the Indo-Pacific and is the state fish of Hawaii. == Description == The fish's teeth and top lip are blue, and the teeth are set close together inside its plump mouth. Its body is laterally compressed (flattened from side to side). It has a small second dorsal spine which is used to lock its main spine into an upright position. This locking helps protect it from predators. == State fish == The reef triggerfish was designated the official fish of Hawaii in 1985, but lost this title in 1990 due to the expiration of a state law. However, on April 17, 2006, the triggerfish became the state fish of Hawaii once again. == References == Category:Tetraodontiformes",
