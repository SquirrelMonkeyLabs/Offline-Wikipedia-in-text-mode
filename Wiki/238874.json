In 1990, he moved to All Nippon Airways (later Yokohama Flügels). However he did not play as much in 1993. In 1994, he moved to Japan Football League club PJM Futures (later Tosu Futures). He retired at the end of the 1995 season. In 1988, when Ikenoue was an Osaka University of Commerce student, he was selected for the Japan national \"B team\" for the 1988 Asian Cup. At that competition, he played two games. However, the Japan Football Association does not count as Japan national team match because this Japan team was \"B team\" not \"top team\". ==Statistics== |- |1989/90||Matsushita Electric||JSL Division 1||14||2||||||0||0||14||2 |- |1990/91||rowspan=\"2\"|All Nippon Airways||rowspan=\"2\"|JSL Division 1||14||1||||||4||0||18||1 |- |1991/92||18||2||||||1||0||19||2 |- |1992||rowspan=\"2\"|Yokohama Flügels||rowspan=\"2\"|J1 League||colspan=\"2\"|-||||||9||2||9||2 |- |1993||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |1994||PJM Futures||Football League||14||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||15||0 |- |1995||Tosu Futures||Football League||11||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||11||2 72||7||1||0||14||2||87||10 72||7||1||0||14||2||87||10 |} ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Gunma Prefecture Category:J1 League players Category:Japan Soccer League players Category:Gamba Osaka players Category:Yokohama Flügels players Category:Sagan Tosu players Category:1988 AFC Asian Cup players",
