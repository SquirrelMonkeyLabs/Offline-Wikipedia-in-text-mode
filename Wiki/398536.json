He skied at the 2011 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships and was the first skier to finish in the visually impaired men's downhill race. He was the third skier to finish in the men's visually impaired Super-G race. Because he cannot see, Gregory Nouhaud was his guide and told him where to go when going down the mountain. ==References== Category:French skiers Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Gers Category:Sportspeople from Occitanie Category:French sportspeople with disabilities",
