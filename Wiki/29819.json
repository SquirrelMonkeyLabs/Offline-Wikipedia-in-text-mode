 "text": "Hyperion (, Hyperíōn - \"The High-One\") is the Titan god of light, son of Gaia and Ouranos. The eldest of his brothers next to Okeanos, Hyperion ruled over the eastern corner of the world, which was given to him as a reward for his part in Ouranos’ castration (he held Ouranos by his left foot). By his sister, the Titaness Theia, he is the father of Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn). He also married a nymph and gave birth to children who could do pharmica one of which was Circe. Hyperion fought against the Olympians in the Titanomachy, after which he was cast into Tartarus alongside his brothers. John Keats used the story for his epic poem Hyperion. Category:Titans",
