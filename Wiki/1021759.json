 "text": "Vectipelta (meaning \"Isle of Wight shield\") is the name of a genus of ankylosaurian dinosaur. It was recently discovered in Lower Cretaceous chalk in England. The specimen has many vertebrae, some of the fore and hindlimbs, and several osteoderms (bony plates). The fossil material was first described in a PhD thesis by Thomas J. Raven. Vectipelta is the first ankylosaur identified from the Isle of Wight in 142 years. This suggests that some specimens previously assigned to Polacanthus and Hylaeosaurus might actually be other taxa. == References == Category:Ankylosauria",
