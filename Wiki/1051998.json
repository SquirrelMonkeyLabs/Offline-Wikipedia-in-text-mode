 "text": "The Church of Bangladesh is one of the oldest and most traditional Anglican Churches in Bangladesh. The history of the plantation of this church is quite old. The Anglican Church or Protestant Church originated in Bengal from the time of British rule in the Indian subcontinent. Since the Anglican Church in England is called the ‘Church of England’, the Anglican Church in undivided India was known as the ‘Church of India’ and in Pakistan as the ‘Church of Pakistan’. Bangladesh became independent in 1971 after 9 months of a long and bloody liberation war and naturally the name of the East Bengal Church was changed to ‘Church of Bangladesh’. The Church validated the Cathedral as St. Thomas’ Church of Bangladesh under Dhaka Diocese which is located at 54 Johnson Road in Old Dhaka. This is the centre and tradition of the Anglican Congregation in Bangladesh with a unique determination in its pride. The Most Reverend Samuel Sunil Mankhin, the present Bishop of Dhaka Diocese is the Moderator (Archbishop) of the Church of Bangladesh, lives here. The Church of Bangladesh currently has three dioceses – Dhaka Archdiocese: Archbishop Samuel Sunil Mankhin, Kushtia Diocese; Bishop Hemen Halder, and Barisal Diocese; Bishop Shourabh Pholia. There are a total of 8 deaneries and 115 parishes under the three dioceses. The population is about 22,000. Membership is diverse, including many different cultures. About half of the total members are from the Garo, Santal, Marma and Chakma ethnic groups of Bangladesh. ==History== The Church of Bangladesh came into being as the outcome of the separation of East Bengal province from Pakistan. This started as a movement which focused on language and took shape through the liberation war in 1971, which created an independent Bangladesh. The Synod of the Church of Pakistan on 30 April 1974 declared and endorsed a free and independent status for the Church of Bangladesh. The Church of Bangladesh brings together the Anglican and English Presbyterian Churches. Following the creation of the Church of Bangladesh, efforts were made to increase local leadership. B. D. Mondal was consecrated as the first national bishop of Dhaka Diocese in 1975. He tried to follow the path of Bishop Blair, by encouraging the active participation of lay leaders from all sections of the church congregations. After the creation of the synod, B. D. Mondal became the first moderator of the Church of Bangladesh and Michael S. Baroi the deputy moderator. At the time of B. D. Mondal's retirement, a new bishop was elected, and Paul Sarker, in January 2003, became the third national bishop of the Church of Bangladesh. Although the title is not employed in this United Protestant denomination, since the acknowledgement of the Archbishop of Dhaka as a primate within the Anglican Communion, he has been entitled to the usual archiepiscopal prefix \"the Most Reverend\".[3] The current Primate and Archbishop of Church of Bangladesh is Samuel Mankhin, enthroned on 5 December 2018. ==National Bishop== Bernabas Dejen Mondal (deceased) ==References== Category:Organisations based in Bangladesh Category:Anglican churches",
