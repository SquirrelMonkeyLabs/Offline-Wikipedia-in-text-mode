 "text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Marianne Williamson, a New Age author and spiritual leader, was announced on January 28, 2019, after the initial formation of an exploratory committee on November 16, 2018. Williamson's bid for the Democratic nomination is her second political campaign, after running as an independent to represent California's 33rd congressional district in 2014. Williamson officially launched her presidential campaign in Los Angeles on January 28, 2019, in front of an audience of 2,000 attendees. Following her Los Angeles announcement, she held her Iowa kickoff in Des Moines on January 31. On January 2, 2020, Williamson laid off her entire campaign staff, speculating a possible withdrawal, in which one of her former staffers said that \"...she plans to continue\". After only appearing in one of the debates and with low poll numbers, Williamson ended her campaign on January 10, 2020. In 2023, many former staffers from her 2020 campaign, who remained anonymous, said that her 2020 campaign was a toxic work environment and that Williamson had anger issues and was abusive to staffers. ==References== ==Other websites== * Williamson",
