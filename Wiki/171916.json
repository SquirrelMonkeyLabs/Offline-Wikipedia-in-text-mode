 "text": "Stellar wind is gas being thrown off from the upper atmosphere of a star. Different types of stars have different types of stellar winds. The Sun's stellar wind is called solar wind. Most stars, especially very bright ones, show continuous outflows of gas from their surfaces making the stellar wind. Radiation pressure is thought to be the main force that pushes the gas away, but modern research uses computer simulations and observations with the most powerful telescopes to understand it further. ==References== Category:Astrophysics",
