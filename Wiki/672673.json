 "text": "Curb Your Enthusiasm is an American television sitcom. It is produced by HBO. It premiered on October 15, 2000. The series was created by comedian Larry David, as a fictional version of himself. It follows him as a TV writer and producer in Los Angeles, though for one season he is in New York City. It also stars Cheryl Hines as Larry's wife, Jeff Garlin as his manager and best friend, Jeff, and Susie Essman as Jeff's wife, Susie. It is based on a 1999 hour-long special, Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, produced for HBO by David. It is filmed in cinéma vérité style, meaning the characters know the camera is there, and add it into the acting style. David wrote outlines for the plots; the cast improvised the dialogue. After the eighth season ended in September 2011, Curb Your Enthusiasm went on a hiatus. The series returned with a ninth season in October 2017, and is now broadcasting its twelfth and final season. ==References== Category:2000 American television series debuts Category:2000s American sitcoms Category:2010s American sitcoms Category:2020s American sitcoms Category:Adultery in fiction Category:English-language television programs Category:Television series about friendship Category:Television series about marriage Category:Television series set in Los Angeles",
