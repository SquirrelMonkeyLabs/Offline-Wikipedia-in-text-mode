 "text": "Talking Heads were a rock band from the United States. The band first became popular in the late 1970s. Talking Heads had an early influence on other musical groups by combining the sounds of punk, art rock, funk, dance and world music with an avant-garde style and the anxious way David Byrne sang on stage. == Reception == Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine said Talking Heads were \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s.\" In 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of the band's albums appeared on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Three of their songs (\"Psycho Killer,\" \"Life During Wartime,\" and \"Once in a Lifetime\") were listed in \"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\". Talking Heads were also included at #64 on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\" In the 2011 update of Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time,\" the band was ranked at No. 100. ==Albums== *Talking Heads: 77 (1977) *More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978) *Fear of Music (1979) *Remain in Light (1980) *Speaking in Tongues (1983) *Little Creatures (1985) *True Stories (1986) *Naked (1988) == References == Category:1975 establishments in New York (state) Category:1970s American music groups Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:1991 disestablishments in the United States Category:American new wave bands Category:American punk bands Category:American rock bands Category:Funk bands Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1991 Category:Musical groups established in 1975 Category:Musical groups from New York City Category:Musical quartets Category:Warner Bros.
