 "text": "In February 2019, Elizabeth Warren, the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts, announced her campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Warren announced on December 31, 2018, that she was forming an exploratory committee to consider running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election. Warren is regarded as the first major Democrat to announce the formation of an exploratory committee, which she did in a video on December 30, 2018. In this video, she says that \"America's middle class is under attack\" in explaining her populist economic agenda. After failing to win any primary contests and low poll numbers, Warren dropped out of the election on March 5, 2020. On April 15, 2020, she supported Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination. ==References== Warren",
