 "text": "The Six suites for unaccompanied cello by Johann Sebastian Bach are some of the most often performed and recognizable solo compositions ever written for cello. They were most likely composed during the period 1717–1723, when Bach served as a Kapellmeister in Köthen. The title of Anna Magdalena Bach's manuscript was Suites á Violoncello Solo senza Basso. The suites have been performed and recorded by many famous cellists; like Mstislav Rostropovich, Emanuel Feuermann, Pierre Fournier, Jacqueline du Pré, Paul Tortelier, André Navarra, Yo-Yo Ma, Gregor Piatigorsky, Mischa Maisky, János Starker, Anner Bijlsma or Heinrich Schiff. Yo-Yo Ma won the 1985 Best Instrumental Soloist Grammy Award for his bestselling album Six Unaccompanied Cello Suites. ==Other websites== *Anna Magdalena's manuscript *MIDI Sequences *Transcriptions of The Suites For Trombone *Transcription of the 4th Suite for Violoncello Piccolo at the Werner Icking Music Archive Category:Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach Category:Suites",
