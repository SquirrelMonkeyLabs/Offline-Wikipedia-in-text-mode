The highest part of the Jura Hills is the “Crêt de la Neige“ in France and it is 1718 metres high. Many fossils and dinosaur tracks have been found there. The rocks of the Jura were formed between 144 million and 208 million years ago. The agriculture and winter tourism are very important for the principal economics. ==Other websites== * The Federal Council - About Switzerland * Chasseral * Le Reculet 1719m and Crêt de la Neige 1717.6m (in German) Category:Mountains of France Category:Mountains of Switzerland",
