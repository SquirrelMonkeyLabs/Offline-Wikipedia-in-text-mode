 "text": "Wrigley Field was a baseball park in Los Angeles, California. It was a home field of the minor league baseball teams called the Los Angeles Angels and the Hollywood Stars. It was also the home of the Los Angeles Angels of the American League in 1961. The ballpark was built in 1925, by the same people who had built the much more famous Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. It was on a city block bound by Avalon Boulevard, 42nd Place, San Pedro Street, and 41st Street. It opened in the last part of the 1925 baseball season and closed for baseball after the 1961 season. It was used for other events from time to time. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a civil rights rally there on May 26, 1963. It was used as a set for several movies and TV shows. It was used for boxing matches a few times. It was also used for soccer matches. The ballpark was torn down in 1969. The block is now the home of a public park called Gilbert Lindsay Park. == Sources == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
