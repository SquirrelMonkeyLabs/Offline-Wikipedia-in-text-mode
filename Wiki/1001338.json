It also offers other services, such as saving accounts, or accounts for pension plans, or morgages, but to a lesser extent. It is among the biggest financial institutions in Switzerland. Because it is part of Swiss Post, everyone who legally lives in Switzerland must be able to get a bank account at Postfinance. Category:Financial institutions of Switzerland",
