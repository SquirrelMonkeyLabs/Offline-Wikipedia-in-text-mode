It's one of the oldest deciduous rainforests (deciduous means the leaves fall off every year) in the world - nearly 130 million years old! Activities close by include a canopy walkway, a cave system and rapids. Tourists can also enjoy birdwatching, jungle trekking and views of the Tahan River. The park covers three states called Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu. Some rare animals are found in this park, like Malayan tigers, Asian elephants and many kinds of birds.
