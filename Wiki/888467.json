He made his debut at the Fine Arts Exhibition of Brera in 1869, but the first official awards came only in the middle of the following decade: in 1876 he won the Mylius prize of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera with a canvas of historical subject set in a large natural context of romantic taste entitled Macbeth meets in the Dunscinane wood the massacres that predict his throne;Macbeth incontra nel bosco di Dunscinane le straghe che gli predicono il trono (da Shakespeare) in 1877 one of his landscapes was purchased at the National Exhibition of Naples by Vittorio Emanuele II.
