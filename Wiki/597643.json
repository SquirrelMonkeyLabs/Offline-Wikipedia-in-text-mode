 "text": "Secretariat (March 30, 1970 – October 4, 1989) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. He was born in Caroline County, Virginia. His record-breaking win in the Belmont Stakes, where he left the field 31 lengths behind him, is widely known as one of the greatest races of all time. He was bred and owned by Penny Chenery. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. He was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. In the List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Secretariat is second only to Man o' War (racing career 1919–1920), who also was a large chestnut colt given the nickname \"Big Red\". Secretariat was euthanized after suffering from laminitis, a hoof disease, at a farm in Paris, Kentucky on October 4, 1989 at the age of 19. ==References== ==Other websites== * The official Secretariat website * Sports Illustrated Top 100 Moments in Sports – short video on Secretariat's Triple Crown (#13 on list) * Classic Photos of Secretariat from Sports Illustrated * ESPN Sports Century – # 35 – Secretariat * Kentucky Derby.com – Secretariat – 1973 * ESPN Classic – ESPN Classic story on 1973 Belmont – November 19, 2003 Category:1970 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Deaths by euthanasia Category:Thoroughbred racehorses",
