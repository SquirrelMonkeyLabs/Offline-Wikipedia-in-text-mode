It lives in India, Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. People have seen it below 3,000 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 34-57 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 44-89 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown, brown-yellow, or brown-gray in color with some spots. There are dark bars on the legs. Parts of the back legs have yellow spots. Scientists believe this frog hatches out of eggs as small frogs and never swims as a tadpole, but they are not sure. This frog can live in different places: forests with water in the air, forests with dry air, grasslands, farms, and gardens. It lives in trees. The female frog makes a nest out of foam for her eggs. She makes the nest on a branch over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
