 "text": "Crimean Estonians are ethnic Estonians who settled in Crimea during the 19th century. After the Crimean War (1853â€“1856), many Tatar villages in Crimea were abandoned due to migration to the Ottoman Empire. This allowed new settlers, including Estonians, to establish communities. == Settlement in Crimea == === Early Migration === The first Estonian settlers arrived in 1861, primarily to escape economic hardship in Estonia, then part of the Russian Empire. The migration was also influenced by the spiritual leader Juhan Leinberg, known as the \"Prophet Maltsvet,\" who inspired Estonians to seek better lives in the south. === Villages === Estonians established or revitalized villages such as Beregovoye, Krasnodarka, Novoestonia, and Upornoe. By the late 19th century, these communities had become self-sufficient, with stone houses, fruit gardens, and local craftsmen. == Cultural Life == Crimean Estonians retained their culture and traditions, including their Lutheran faith, folk customs, and the Estonian language. They built schools and churches, maintaining a sense of identity despite living far from their homeland. == Challenges and Decline == === Soviet Period === During Stalin's deportations in the 1940s, many Crimean Estonians were forcibly relocated to other parts of the Soviet Union. This caused a decline in their population and disrupted their communities. === Modern Era === By the 21st century, the number of Estonians in Crimea had significantly decreased, and their villages became less distinct as Estonian settlements. == Legacy == Today, Crimean Estonians are remembered as part of the diverse ethnic tapestry of Crimea. Although their numbers have dwindled, their history reflects the broader patterns of migration and cultural resilience in the region. Estonians Category:Estonian diaspora",
