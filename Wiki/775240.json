 "text": "The FN Five-seven, marketed as the Five-seveN, is an armor-piercing semi- automatic pistol made by the Belgian gun company FN Herstal. It fires the FN 5.7x28mm bullet, where the gun itself gets its name. It was made around the same time as the FN P90 PDW. Although the FN 5.7x28mm bullet is small, it has low recoil, high stopping power, high accuracy, armor-piercing abilities, and long range because of its high muzzle velocity. The small size of the bullet also allows for the gun's box magazines to hold many bullets, with a normal magazine holding 20 bullets. It is popular with militaries and police forces worldwide. However, its ability to shoot through body armor and the high number of bullets it can carry make it a very controversial gun in the United States for civilian use. The Five-seven can be seen in video games like the Splinter Cell series, Counter-Strike, the Rainbow Six series, the Battlefield (series), and the Call of Duty series. == References == Category:Pistols",
