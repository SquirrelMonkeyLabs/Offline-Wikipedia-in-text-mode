 "text": "The flank steak is a type of meat cut from the abdomen or lower chest. It is a lean steak cut. ==Overview== A long and flat cut, flank steak is used in a lot of dishes including the London broil and as an alternative to the traditional skirt steak in fajitas. The Grain (meat fibre) is seen in flank steaks, as it comes from a very-worked part of the cow, and many chefs cut across the grain to make the meat more tender. It is frequently used in Asian cuisine, often sold in Chinese markets as \"stir-fry beef\", and is served in French cuisine as an at most medium-rare steak. Flank is also used for steak jerky. ==Usage== The cut is common in Colombia, where it's known as sobrebarriga (\"over the belly\"). ==Preparation== Like most steaks, the Flank steak can be cooked with different methods. ==References== Category:Cuts of beef",
