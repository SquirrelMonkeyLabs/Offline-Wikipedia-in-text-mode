Kōgō is the title of a non- reigning empress consort. The title, still in use, is generally conferred on an emperor's wife who had given birth to the heir to the throne.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). \"Kōgō\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 543. The title was first awarded posthumously in 806 to the late mother of Emperor Heizei.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial Family, p. 318. Chūgū was a term which evolved during the Heian period; and it came to be understood as the title of the empress. For a time, chūgū replaced kōgō; and then the titles became interchangeable.Nussbaum, \"Chūgū\" at p. 127. The numbers of kōgō varied, but there was only one Chūgū at a time.Ponsonby-Fane, pp. 300–302. The title kōtaigō was given to the wife of an ex-emperor; and the title tai- kōtaigō came to be used by a dowager empress. ==Related pages== *Imperial House of Japan ==References== Category:History of Japan Category:Lists of Japanese people Category:Emperors and empresses",
