The earliest written record of gold mining in Telkibánya comes from 1341. Before 1367, there was a wooden chapel in the southern part of Telkibánya. In 1447, John Hunyadi gave Telkibánya to the Rozgonyi family. Around 1517, the population of Telkibánya was about 150 people. After the near-surface gold veins were exhausted, mining declined, and production stopped between 1574 and 1757. Queen Maria Theresa ordered the mines to reopen. In the early 19th century, the gold and silver mines in Telkibánya were still active, and miners lived in the settlement. In 1825, Ferdinand Bretzenheim founded a porcelain factory in Telkibánya, using nearby kaolin deposits. This was the first porcelain factory in Hungary. == Population == In 2022, 94.4% of the population identified as Hungarian, 2.4% as Slovak, 0.9% as Roma, 0.6% as Ukrainian, 0.2% as German, and 4.5% as other non-local nationalities (3.9% did not respond; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%).
