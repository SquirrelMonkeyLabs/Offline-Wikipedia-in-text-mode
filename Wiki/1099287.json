The temple is known for its stunning architecture and exquisite design. The work on the pagoda started during the reign of Rama III (1824–51). The main prang was completed in 1851, after nine years of continued construction. ==History== Wat Arun's story started a long time ago, during the Ayutthaya period. It was previously known as Wat Makok or the Olive Monastery. Later, when King Taksin ruled in the late 1700s, the temple was renovated and given a new name: Wat Chaeng, also known as the Temple of Dawn. The word \"Wat Arun\" also means \"Temple of Dawn.\" People believe it derives from the Hindu god Aruna, who depicts the sun as it begins to rise. ==Cultural Significance== Wat Arun has great cultural and religious importance for Thai people. It is a Buddhist worship and meditation facility that attracts both believers and visitors. The temple is also a well-known emblem of Bangkok, appearing regularly on postcards, paintings, and other works of art. ==Architecture== The most notable feature is the tall center prang (a Hindu-style tower), which is encircled by four smaller satellite prangs. These towers symbolize Mount Meru, the revered cosmological center of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain faiths. The prangs are beautifully embellished with bright porcelain and seashells that were previously used as ballast on ships arriving from China. Visitors can climb steep stairways to the upper platforms of the prangs, which provide panoramic views of the Chao Phraya River and Bangkok. The temple complex also includes the Ordination Hall (Ubosot), which features stunning frescoes, and the Niramitr Buddha image, a golden Buddha figure. == Gallery == File:Wat Arun 2020.jpg|The prang, seen from within the temple grounds (2020) File:Bangkok Wat Arun Phra Prang Indra Erawan.jpg|Main prang, Indra seated atop Airavata (2001) File:Templo Wat Arun, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 16.jpg|View of the river from the main prang (2013) File:Bangkok along the Chao Phraya and Wat Arun (15068304635).jpg|The vihara, seen from the main prang (2014) File:Wat Arun 2017-06.jpg|Buddha statues in the cloister (2017) File:Ubosot of Wat Arun.jpg|The ordination hall (2018) File:Interior of the ordination hall of Wat Arun.jpg|The principal Buddha image, in the ordination hall (2018) File:วัดแจ้ง1.jpg|The temple lit up at night (2017) File:0000140 - Wat Arun Ratchawararam 005.jpg|Frontal view of the prang at night (2017) ==References== Category:18th-century buildings and structures Category:Buddhist temples in Thailand Category:Temples in Bangkok",
