He was the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of East Renfrewshire. He was first made a Member of Parliament at the 1997 General Election for the Eastwood constituency. He has been the East Renfrewshire MP from 2005 onwards. He held two cabinet posts: Minister of State for Europe (June 2007-October 2008) and Secretary of State for Scotland (October 2008-May 2010). He was made the shadow Secretary of State for Defence in October 2010. He became the Shadow Secretary of State for International Development in 2013. He resigned from this job in November 2014 because he wanted to be the leader of the Scottish Labour Party. On 13 December 2014 he became the leader of the Scottish Labour Party. Because he was an MP in the UK Parliament, the deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party represented him in the Scottish Parliament. The deputy leader was Kezia Dugdale. After the Scottish Labour Party's defeat in the 2015 general election (with Murphy himself losing his seat), Murphy resigned as party leader. ==References== ==Other websites== *Jim Murphy's website *Page at parliament.co.uk Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs Category:Members of the British House of Commons for Scottish constituencies Category:Politicians from Glasgow Category:Secretaries of State for Scotland",
