 "text": "The International Phonetic Alphabet is a way to express how a word is pronounced. IPA Braille is a way to write the International Phonetic Alphabet using Braille letters. That way, people who are blind can also read how a word is pronounced. A first version of IPA in Braille was published in 1934. The IPA was updated several times since then, but IPA Braille was not changed. In 1989, the Braille version of IPA was completely outdated. Between 2008 and 2011 a new version was developed. It still uses many of the letters of the original, but it is also different in some ways. Diacritics are completely different, for example. Category:Braille",
