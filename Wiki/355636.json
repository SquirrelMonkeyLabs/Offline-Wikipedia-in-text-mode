 "text": "\"Gimme More\" is a song from Britney Spears' album Blackout. The song was released in late 2007. It was her comeback single after a few years out of the music business because of her personal problems. It hit the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is a dance-pop and electropop song with elements of disco music. Its lyrics are apparently about dancing and having sex although they're actually about the media fascination for Spears' private life as noted in lyrics such as \"Cameras are flashing my way darty dancin' they keep watching, feels like the crowd was saying: gimme more\" The song was first performed at the 2007 VMA awards; a performance heavily criticized by the media comparing it to Spears' standards in previous ceremonies. It was also performed during the Femme Fatale tour in an Egypt-style remix in 2011 as well as in Britney: Piece Of Me Vegas Residency in 2013. The song was an international success reaching the top 10 in more than 15 countries including the US, UK and Australia among others Category:Britney Spears songs Category:2007 songs Category:Songs about sexuality Category:Lil' Kim songs",
