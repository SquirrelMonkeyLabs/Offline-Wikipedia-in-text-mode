 "text": "The Mientien small tree frog, Mientien tree frog, or temple tree frog (Kurixalus idiootocus) is a frog. It lives in Taiwan. People have seen it between 50 and 2000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in grasslands, places with small woody plants, and pady fields. This frog lays eggs in the dirt between the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the rain pushes the tadpoles into shallow water that does not move. The tadpoles can float on top of the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that human beings have changed. However, human beings built roads and buildings in the places where the frog would live. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
