 "text": "ProSci is an American biotechnology company with offices located in Poway, California. The Poway site focuses on manufacturing antibodies for use in research studies leading to diagnostics and therapy development. They specialize in producing a range of antibodies using polyclonal, monoclonal, and recombinant production techniques. ProSci has been a pioneer in the development of commercially available single domain antibodies (VHH â€“ variable heavy chain) derived from camelid species, including llamas and alpacas. ==History== ProSci Incorporated was co-founded in 1998 by Yu Geng, M.D. with the mission to develop neutralizing antibodies against emergent viruses. Their innovative approach using genetically engineered yeast strains and glycoproteins to mimic the HIV-1 glycan coat led to the development of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 glycans. Early in 2020, ProSci was one of only a handful of companies that had antibodies available that recognized key proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Their reagents led to key discoveries on the mechanism of entry as well as neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Today, ProSci continues to offer tens of thousands of antibodies and custom antibody services to help researchers advance discoveries in the life sciences. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Companies based in California Category:San Diego Category:1998 establishments in California Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States",
