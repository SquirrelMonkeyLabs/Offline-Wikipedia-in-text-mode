 "text": "Gears of War, sometimes called Gears, is a third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft. It was released only for the Xbox 360 in 2006 but was later released for Microsoft Windows. The company sold three million copies in ten weeks and was the fastest selling video game of 2006. It was the second most played game on the Xbox 360's online service, Xbox Live, in 2006 - only beaten by Halo 3. A film version of the game is currently being made by New Line cinema. The sequel, Gears of War 2, was released in November 2008. == Copy protection == The PC version uses a DRM protection scheme. The certificate needed to play the game is invalid since January 1, 2009, making the game unplayable. Fortunately to the players, the protection can be worked around by simply changing the system date. == References == == Other websites == *Gears of War website (Warning: Contains pictures of in-game violence) Category:2006 video games Category:Epic Games games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Microsoft video games Category:Military science fiction video games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games",
