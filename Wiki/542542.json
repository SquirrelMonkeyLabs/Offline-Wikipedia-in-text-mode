 "text": "Ikeja is a town and local government area of Lagos State, Nigeria. It serves as the capital of Lagos State. Ikeja is known for being a well-planned commercial settlement with shopping malls, pharmacies and government reservation areas. ==History== Ikeja, originally known as \"Akeja,\" was named after a god of the Awori tribe of Ota. The Awori people first settled there, and the territory was attacked for slaves until the mid-nineteenth century. It formed an agricultural hinterland for Lagos in the early twentieth century. The construction of the Lagos-Ibadan railway in 1901, as well as the expansion of Lagos as a port, converted Ikeja into a residential and industrial district of Lagos. In the mid-1960s, an industrial estate was constructed, and in 1976, Ikeja was designated as the state capital of Lagos. ==Communities== Communities in the city of Ikeja include; # Agidingbi # Alausa # Akiode # Anifowose # Oregun # Ojodu # Opebi # Ogba # Magodo # Maryland # Onigbongbo # Government Reserved Area (GRA) Ikeja. == References == ==Other websites== Category:Settlements in Lagos State Category:Local Government Areas in Lagos State Category:Towns in Nigeria Category:State capitals in Nigeria",
