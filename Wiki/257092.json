 "text": "\"Sun King\" is a song written by John Lennon but credited to Lennon/McCartney. It was recorded by The Beatles for their Abbey Road album. ==History== The working title was \"Here Comes the Sun King\". It was shortened to \"Sun King\" to avoid confusion with the song \"Here Comes the Sun\". The song is in three-part harmony, sung by Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Harrison. At the end of the song, the music stops abruptly and a Ringo Starr drum fill leads into the next track, \"Mean Mr. Mustard\". The mixing of Romance languages occurs in the last three lines of the song. In 1969, Lennon was interviewed about these lyrics and said, \"We just started joking, you know, singing 'cuando para mucho.' So we just made up... Paul knew a few Spanish words from school, you know. So we just strung any Spanish words that sounded vaguely like something. And of course we got 'chicka ferdy' in. That's a Liverpool expression. Just like sort of-- it doesn't mean anything to me but (childish taunting) 'na-na, na-na- na!'\" In 1976, The Bee Gees covered the song for the musical documentary All This and World War II. ==Notes== ==Other websites== * * Category:The Beatles songs Category:1969 songs",
