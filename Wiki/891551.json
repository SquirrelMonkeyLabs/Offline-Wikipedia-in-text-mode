It is located 33 kilometers southwest of the capital, Amman, and rises about 770 meters above sea level. Its population in 2015 reached about 105,353 people. Madaba is the ninth largest city in the Kingdom. The city was founded by the Moabites in the thirteenth century BC, as it was part of their kingdom extending east of the Jordan River. Successively, many civilizations ruled the region Madaba played a prominent role after it was occupied by the Byzantines because it included a number of its important historical churches. Until now, the city is considered one of the most important places for the followers of the Christian faith, due to the presence of these religious monuments. Located in its vicinity are many archaeological sites and holy places represented by Christian pilgrimage sites such as Al-Maghtas, Mount Nebo, Mukawar and Umm al-Rasas, which makes it a destination for tourists. The importance of Madaba in the early centuries of Christianity was similar to the importance of the city of Jerusalem as the most important center of Christian life in Transjordan, where it was mentioned in the Bible. It was destroyed as a result of the violent earthquake that struck the region in 749, and other earthquakes that followed. But the Christian Arab tribes from the Karak region revived and settled them starting in 1880 AD, where it is inhabited today by Christians and Muslims alike. Madaba is very famous for its mosaics art, and for its special heritage within its alleys; ancient Byzantine churches, mosques and unique architecture. It also contains the only institute in the world to teach the mosaics art. It is sometimes referred to as the city of mosaics. The map of Madaba is one of the most important mosaic monuments in the city. The city's first municipal council was established in 1912, and today it is under the name of Greater Madaba Municipality. Within its borders five districts are located, constituting the borders of the city of Madaba, which extends over 54 square kilometers.
