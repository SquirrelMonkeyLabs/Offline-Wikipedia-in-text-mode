The company focuses on tools for employee management, especially for blue-collar workers. == Overview == Connecteam targets companies that primarily employ deskless or frontline workers, offering tools for employee communication, time management, and human resources. The platform includes features like task tracking, shift scheduling, and team communication. == History == Connecteam was officially founded in 2016 by Amir Nehemia, Lirit Shmueli, and Hadar Shmueli. The origins of the company trace back to 2012, when Hadar and Lirit began working on their first product, MovieMonster, a mobile social trivia game where players competed to recognize movie quotes. During the development of the game, their cousin Dor Elias joined the development effort. The game gained traction among movie enthusiasts, though the team struggled to generate significant revenue from it. Building on their experience with MovieMonster, the team created a SaaS engine that enabled a quick development of similar trivia games with unique themes and visuals, such as SongsMonster and HistoryMonsters. These gamified mechanics provided the foundation for their next phase. In 2013, they partnered with another cousin, Amir Nehemia, who took on the role of leading business development (BudDev). Together, they decided to convert their gamified mechanics into corporate training, and Amir began introducing the platform to HR departments. This approach proved successful in Israel, with prominent companies like Strauss and Gett adopting the platform to engage and train their employees. In 2016, the team officially pivoted to focus on enterprise solutions, evolving into a robust workforce management platform. This shift included developing features like time tracking, read-and-sign capabilities, and calendar management, setting the stage for Connecteam's future success. During 2017, Lirit and Hadar stepped away from daily operations, and leadership transitioned to Amir Nehemia, Daniel Nuriel and Yonatan Nuriel. Connecteam's innovative approach and focus on deskless workers attracted significant investor attention. In 2021, the company raised $37 million in a Series B funding round.[ref] This was followed in 2022 by a $120 million Series C funding round, valuing the company at $800 million. By 2022, Connecteam served over 20,000 companies globally and had more than 1 million active users. Today, Connecteam continues to revolutionize workforce management, empowering businesses with mobile-first solutions for communication, scheduling, and employee engagement. == References == Category:Software companies",
