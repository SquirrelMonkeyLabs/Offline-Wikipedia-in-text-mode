 "text": "Yasukuni Shrine is a controversial Shinto shrine in Tokyo. It commemorates (by name) over two million Japanese people who died in wars from 1868 to 1954. Post-war right-wing Japanese politicians have paid visits to the shrine to pay respects to the war dead, but this is seen by China and Korea as a provocative act as over a thousand Japanese war criminals are enshrined there. ==Other websites== *Yasukuni Shrine at About Asian History Category:Shinto shrines in Tokyo Category:Bekkaku kanpeisha Category:Gokoku shrines Category:Former Beppyo shrines Category:Chokusaisha",
