 "text": "The Pahlavi dynasty (Persian: سلسله پهلوی) is the last Iranian royal dynasty, ruling for almost 54 years between 1925 and 1979. The dynasty was founded by Reza Shah, a Mazanderani soldier. The dynasty took on the name of the Pahlavi language spoken in the pre-Islamic Sassanian Empire in order to strengthen his nationalist credentials. == Origins == The dynasty was founded by Reza Shah of Mazanderani descent. Reza's father was a Mazanderani, commissioned in the 7th Savadkuh Regiment, and served in the Siege of Herat in 1856. His mother was a Georgian Muslim immigrant from Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire). == History == The Pahlavi regime established by Reza Shah was a secular, nationalist, militarist and anti-communist regime.Michael P. Zirinsky (1992). Imperial Power and Dictatorship: Britain and the Rise of Reza Shah, 1921-1926. International Journal of Middle East Studies 24. Cambridge University Press. pp. 639–663. Although he himself was of Mazanderani descent, his government carried out an extensive policy of Persianization trying to create a single, united and largely homogeneous nation, similar to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's policy of Turkification in Turkey after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. After the removal of Reza Shah in 1941, his son, Mohammad Reza Shah, took his place. Finally, the dynasty came to an end with the Iranian revolution. == Sources == Category:History of Iran Category:Royal dynasties Category:Iranian royalty",
