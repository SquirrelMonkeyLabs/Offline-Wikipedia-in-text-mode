 "text": "Speer's collared frog (Mannophryne speeri) is a frog. It lives in the Sierra de Portuguesa in Lara, Venezuela. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 19.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 23.5 mm long. The frog has a wide collar. There is a stripe that starts at the eye. ==Home== This frog lives in forests where there is water in the air. Scientists found it in a stream near the Morador River. Scientists saw the frog between 800 and 1700 meters above sea level. Scientists do not know if this frog lives in any protected places, but there are two near where they found the frog: Parque Nacional Dinira and Parque Nacional El Guache. ==Young== Scientists think the frog has young the same way as other frogs in Mannophryne: The female frog lays eggs near streams, and, after the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms, especially coffee farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
