 "text": "Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu (1405 – 17 January 1468), commonly known as Skanderbeg ( from , romanized: İskender Bey; Latin:,) was an Albanian nobleman and military commander. He led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in what is today Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia. ==Reputation== Because he defended his principality (the Principality of Kastrioti) against Ottoman influences, he was given the Latin title Athleta Christi (meaning \"warrior of Christianity\") by Pope Callixtus III. Today, many people see him as an Albanian national hero. He was only able to hold his own possessions within the very small area in today's northern Albania. This is where almost all of his engagements against Ottoman forces took place. Skanderbeg's military skills were a major obstacle to the Ottoman military, and many in western Europe thought he was a model of Christian resistance against the Ottoman Empire. From 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg's 10,000-man army invaded Ottoman territory, fighting against superior and better-supplied Ottoman forces. He was greatly admired for this. He became a central figure in the Albanian National Awakening. He is honoured in modern Albania, and is commemorated with many monuments and cultural works. == References == Category:1405 births Category:1468 deaths Category:Albanian people",
