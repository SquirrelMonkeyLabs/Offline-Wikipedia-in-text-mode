 "text": "Michel 'Bunny' Larocque (April 6, 1952 - July 29, 1992) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers, and St. Louis Blues in the National Hockey League. ==Playing career== Larocque would help win four Vezina Trophies. During that time, the trophy was given to the main goaltenders on the team allowing the fewest goals in the regular season. The first three were mostly because of the all-star play of Ken Dryden. The final trophy was with Denis Herron and Richard Sevigny in 1981. He would win four Stanley Cups with Montreal in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979. == Career statistics == Season Team League GP W L T MIN GA SO GAA SV% 1970–71 Ottawa 67's OHA 56 — — — 3345 189 5 3.39 — 1971–72 Ottawa 67's OHA 55 — — — 3287 189 4 3.45 — 1972-73 Nova Scotia Voyageurs AHL 47 — — — 2705 113 1 2.50 — 1973–74 Montreal Canadiens NHL 27 15 8 2 1431 69 0 2.89 — 1974–75 Montreal Canadiens NHL 25 17 5 3 1480 74 3 3.00 — 1975–76 Montreal Canadiens NHL 22 16 1 3 1220 50 2 2.46 — 1976–77 Montreal Canadiens NHL 26 19 2 4 1525 53 4 2.09 — 1977–78 Montreal Canadiens NHL 30 22 3 4 1729 77 1 2.67 — 1978–79 Montreal Canadiens NHL 34 22 7 4 1986 94 3 2.84 — 1979–80 Montreal Canadiens NHL 39 17 13 8 2259 125 3 3.32 — 1980–81 Montreal Canadiens NHL 28 16 9 3 1623 82 1 3.03 — 1980–81 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 8 3 3 2 460 40 0 5.22 — 1981–82 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 50 10 24 8 2647 207 0 4.69 — 1982–83 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 16 3 8 3 835 68 0 4.89 — 1982–83 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 2 0 1 1 120 8 0 4.00 — 1983-84 Springfield Indians AHL 5 5 3 2 301 21 0 4.18 — 1983–84 St. Louis Blues NHL 5 0 5 0 300 31 0 6.20 — 1984-85 Peoria Rivermen AHL 13 7 3 3 786 41 0 3.13 — NHL totals 312 160 89 45 17,615 978 17 3.33 — ==Other websites== * Category:1952 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Ice hockey people from Quebec Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:Nova Scotia Voyageurs players Category:Philadelphia Flyers players Category:Saint John Flames players Category:Springfield Indians players Category:St. Louis Blues players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:Vezina Trophy winners Category:Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins players Category:International Hockey League (1945–2001) players Category:Ontario Hockey League players",
