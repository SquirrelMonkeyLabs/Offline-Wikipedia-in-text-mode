It replaced Cyber Sunday in the late October slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. The event featured matches for \"bragging rights\" between wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands with a Bragging Rights trophy being the prize. SmackDown won the trophy both times the event was held. Bragging Rights was replaced by Vengeance in 2011.
