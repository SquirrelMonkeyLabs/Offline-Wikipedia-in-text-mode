 "text": "The Pancor Jackhammer is a fully automatic, rotary magazine, 12 gauge shotgun. Designed in 1984 by John Anderson, and patented in 1987. The concept of a fully automatic shotgun has not taken hold with the military, or with law enforcement, due to the difficulty of controlling such a weapon. Only three prototypes were constructed, with two of the three exploding during testing; only one survives today, in the hands of a private collector. However, the shotgun's futuristic appearance has made it popular in action movies and video games. After using pump action shotguns during the Korean War, Anderson thought he could make a superior shotgun since he found reloading them to be cumbersome and time-consuming. When the design was ready for delivery, a number of foreign nations reportedly showed interest in it and even placed orders for the first manufacturing units. However, the United States Department of Defense's testing delayed the design's export for production, even though it was ultimately rejected. Category:Shotguns",
