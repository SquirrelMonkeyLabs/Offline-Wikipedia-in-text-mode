 "text": "Háromhuta (Slovak: Tri Huty) is a village in Sárospatak District of Borsod- Abaúj-Zemplén County. Its population in 2024 was 108. == Location == It lies deep in the Zemplén Mountains, about 70 kilometers northeast of Miskolc, the county seat, by road. It is made up of three more-or-less separate parts: Óhuta, Középhuta, and Újhuta. Óhuta is the westernmost, along a main road that cuts through the mountains, while Középhuta and Újhuta are a few kilometers east of the road. The nearby villages are: Nagyhuta to the northeast, Makkoshotyka to the east, Komlóska to the southeast, Erdőhorváti to the south, Mogyoróska to the southwest, and Regéc to the west. It is about 9 kilometers from both Erdőhorváti and Regéc, but farther from the other neighboring villages. The closest bigger town is Sárospatak, about 30 kilometers away. == History == In the forested mountains near Regéc, Francis II Rákóczi founded the village in 1698 to make glass. Glass production continued until 1916. The three parts of the village, Regéchuta, Középhuta, and Új-Regéchuta (now called Óhuta, Középhuta, and Újhuta) grew around the glass factory. In the last third of the 19th century, these parts separated from Regéc and together became an independent village called Háromhuta. After the glass factory closed, the people lived by working in forestry. == Population == In 2022, 88.9% of the population indentified as Hungarian, 4.3% as Slovak, 0.9% as Ukrainian, 3.4% as other non-Hungarian (10.3% did not declare; due to dual identities, the total may be higher than 100%). By religion, 41% were Roman Catholic, 6% Reformed, 7.7% Greek Catholic, 2.6% non-denominational (41.9% did not respond).Háromhuta Helységnévtár == Notes == == More information == * Háromhuta website * Szutorcsik József: A regéci három huta népe Category:Settlements in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Category:Villages in Hungary",
