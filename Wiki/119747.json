The first one discovered was Charon which is near one quarter the size of Pluto. Charon was also sometimes considered a double dwarf planet. The second was Nix, the third was Hydra, the fourth moon was Kerberos, and the fifth moon to be discovered was Styx. ==History== The first and largest moon discovered orbiting around Pluto was Charon, Charon was discovered on June 22 1978 by James Christy. In May 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope discovered two smaller moons which were named Nix and Hydra. Two even smaller moons named Kerberos and Styx were discovered in 2011 and 2012. ==References== *http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Planets#DwarfPlanets *http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/20110720.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm;_medium=feed&utm;_campaign=Feed%3A+NewHorizonsHeadlines+%28New+Horizons+News+Feed% *http://www.space.com/16531-pluto-fifth-moon-hubble-discovery.html",
