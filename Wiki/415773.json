Ancient galaxy may be most distant ever seen. Space.com. At the time of the announcement, it was the oldest galaxy found. It beat the previous distance record holder by about 150 million light years. With the revision of the distance, it again became the oldest galaxy found as of December 12, 2012. The next attempt to see further will be the James Webb Space Telescope launched sometime this decade. Unlike UDFy-38135539, UDFj-39546284 has not been spectroscopically confirmed.
