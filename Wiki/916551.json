 "text": "The Yakutian (Yakut: Саха ата, Sakha ata) or Yakut is a horse breed that is native to the Republic of Sakha (or Yakutia) in Siberia. It is similar to the Mongolian horse and Przewalski's horse, but is larger than them. It is special because of how it adapts to the very cold climate of Yakutia. It is able to find and graze on vegetation that is hidden under deep snow. It can survive without shelter in temperatures that reach −70 °C (−94 °F). == Breed traits == The breed averages 140 centimetres (13.3 hands) in stallions and 136 cm (13.2 h) in mares.
