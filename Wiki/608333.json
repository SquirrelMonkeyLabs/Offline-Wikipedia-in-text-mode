He was the son of New York City mogul Seymour Durst, and the elder brother of Douglas Durst, head of the Durst Organization. His crime allegations and trial were covered in the HBO miniseries The Jinx. ==Criminal charges== Durst was suspected of foul play against three individuals in different states: Kathleen McCormack Durst, his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Susan Berman, his longtime friend, who was murdered in California in 2000; and his neighbor, Morris Black, who was killed in Texas in 2001. Durst was the subject of a multi-state manhunt and was convicted of dismembering Black, but acquitted of his murder. On March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in New Orleans, Louisiana, on a first-degree murder warrant signed by a Los Angeles judge in relation to the Berman killing. On November 4, 2016, Durst was transferred to California and soon after was arraigned in Los Angeles on first-degree murder charges. On September 17, 2021, the jury convicted Durst of first degree murder in the death of Susan Berman. ==Death== On October 16, 2021, Durst tested positive for COVID-19 and was placed on a ventilator.
