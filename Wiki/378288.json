It is, alongside Jhangochi, referred to, sometimes, as one of the oldest dialects of the Punjabi language. It is spoken in the Sargodha Division of Pakistani Punjab. Its name is derived from the former Shahpur District (now Shahpur Tehsil, part of Sargodha District). This dialect has great proximity and is transitional with Majhi. The dialect is spoken with accents corresponding to its neighbouring dialects,The Indo-Aryan Languages By Colin P.
