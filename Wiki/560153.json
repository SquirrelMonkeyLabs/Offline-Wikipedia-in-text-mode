 "text": "Lindisfarne Castle is a castle on Holy Island, near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, England. The island is accessible from the mainland at low tide by means of a causeway. A fort was built here in 1550 during the time of Henry VIII. About 20 years later it was replaced by a stone fortress. It was abandoned in 1893 and afterwards used as a lookout by the Coastguard. In 1903, repair work started to change the fortress into a home by the new owner, Edward Hudson. In 1944, it was donated to the National Trust. == References == Category:Castles in England Category:Lindisfarne Category:16th-century buildings and structures",
