 "text": "The Bhagavad Gita is one of the holiest books of Hinduism. The Bhagavad Gita (romanized: bhagavad-gītā, lit. 'The Song by God'), often referred to as the Gita (IAST: gītā), is part of the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. It is considered to be written in the first millennium BCE. It has teachings said to be given by Sri Krishna, who is considered a Supreme divine being. In the book (Bhagvat Gita), Krishna answers questions from Arjuna, a Pandava prince, about a human's moral duties (called dharma) regarding a broad range of philosophical and metaphysical matters. The Bhagavad Gita is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between the Pandava prince Arjuna and his charioteer guide, Krishna. At the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their cousins, Kauravas, Prince Arjuna is in doubt, thinking about the violence the war will cause. Wondering if he should renounce the war, Arjuna seeks the counsel of Krishna, whose answers and their discourse constitute the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna counsels Arjuna to \"fulfill his warrior duty\" for the upholding of dharma. The Krishna–Arjuna dialogue covers a broad range of spiritual topics, touching upon moral and ethical dilemmas, and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war that Arjuna faces. The Gita posits the existence of an individual self (Atman or Soul) and the supreme self (Brahman or Supreme Soul) within each being. The dialogue between the prince and his charioteer has been interpreted as a metaphor for an immortal dialogue between the human self and God. The text covers the philosophy of Yoga in terms of Gyan (Knowledge) yoga, Bhakti (devotion) yoga, Karma (action) yoga, and Rāja (governance) yoga,. A key chapter is Sankhya Yoga, The Book of Doctrines, Self-Realization, or The Yoga of Knowledge (and Philosophy). Filled with questions about the meaning and purpose of life, Prince Arjuna asks Krishna about the nature of life, Self, death, afterlife, and whether there is a deeper meaning and reality. The chapter summarizes the ideas eternal Self in each person (Soul), and the Universal-Self present in everyone (Supreme Soul), along with concept of re-birth This chapter is an overview of the remaining sixteen chapters of the Bhagavad Gita. == Brief == Firstly paramaathma existed (Paramaathma means eshwara). The paramaathma created the jeevaathma (jeevaathma mean all living beings) Birth and death are a continuous process We get another birth according to our karmas in this birth (our next birth may be as an ant or a snake or a fish or a bird or an animal or a human it depends on our karmas in this birth) Moksha means seeing the paramaathma in all living beings, including ourselves. Another meaning of Moksha is to give up lust, anger, greed, attachment,ego and jealousy before death. Moksha can be achieved in four ways: 1\\. Karma Yoga - Doing Karma Without Expecting Anything 2\\. Bhakti Yoga - Doing service related to gods and temples without expecting anything 3\\. Jnana Yoga - Gaining knowledge and sharing it without expecting anything in return 4\\. Kriya Yoga or Raja Yoga -doing Meditation without expecting anything in return As humans, we must follow dharma. Dharma means fulfilling our own responsibilities, leaving behind pain and fear. The true meaning of Dharma is giving and taking something according to the agreement without any deception, directly or indirectly. ==References== == Other websites == * Bhagvat Geeta – Dialogues of Kreeshna and Arjoon by Charles Wilkins * Bhagavad Gita Category:Hindu texts Category:2nd-century BC books",
