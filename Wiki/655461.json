CBS also handles the TV rights to much of its own theatrical films. The company formerly distributed the film libraries from Paramount Pictures and Republic Pictures, among others. The company is also responsible for international television distribution rights to series by Rysher Entertainment including certain HBO series through its CBS Studios International division. This would mark the sixth distribution name for CBS as CBS Television Film Sales was the first (1952–1958), CBS Films, Inc. was the second (1958–1967), CBS Enterprises was the third (1968–1971), Eyemark Entertainment was the fourth (1995–2000), and CBS Paramount Domestic Television was the fifth (2006–2012). From 2006 to 2008, CTD distributed the DreamWorks Television and DreamWorks Pictures libraries in conjunction with Tribune Entertainment, after Viacom's acquisition of DreamWorks in February 2006, but before the studio was spun off. These distribution rights are now held by Disney-ABC Domestic Television (for live-action TV series and post-9/2005 live-action films) and Trifecta Entertainment & Media (for earlier live-action films and all animated productions). Until May 2009, CTD distributed the Paramount Pictures library on television. By then, CBS also dropped the name \"Paramount\" from television for good, renaming CBS Paramount Television to CBS Television Studios. Paramount has also joined up with Trifecta. However, CTD continues to distribute films currently copyrighted by CBS (or a subdivision thereof), including those films from Cinema Center Films and CBS Theatrical Films, along with a few select entries to which CBS bought ancillary rights in later years, such as My Fair Lady. The current moniker for CTD's overseas distribution arm is CBS Studios International (since 2009). Its predecessors were CBS Broadcast International and CBS Paramount International Television. In 2012, CBS Television Distribution ceased to be a corporate entity, becoming a division of CBS Studios, Inc in 2021 CBS Media Ventures a CBS Viacom in December 2019 of Jeopardy & Wheel of Fortune Plus Debmar Mercury Like Family Feud The Wendy Williams Show or Other or Show Like The Oprah Winfrey Show Dr Phil & Rachael Ray Stay Home with Rachael or at Home with Rachael Mighty Mouse The New Adventures Category:Columbia Broadcasting System Category:2006 establishments in the United States Category:Television production companies",
