 "text": "Kipchaks, also known as Qipchaqs, Cumans or Cuman–Kipchaks, were a group of prominent Turkic nomads in the Middle Ages. ==Overview== The Kipchaks played a significant role in Eurasian history from approximately the 9th to the 13th century. Originally hailing from the Central Asian steppes, the Kipchaks spread across a vast area from the Volga River to the Danube, leaving a lasting impact on medieval Eastern Europe and the Middle East. ==History== ===Origin=== The Kipchaks are believed to have originated in the region north of the Aral Sea, near present-day Kazakhstan. They were part of a broader Turkic migration across the Eurasian steppes that began in the early medieval period. ===Early history=== By the 10th century, the Kipchaks had settled in the western steppes, where they allied and clashed with neighboring tribes, such as the Khazars and Pechenegs. By the late 11th century, they were known in various historical sources as Cumans in Europe, who formed a loosely organized confederation known as the Cuman–Kipchak confederation. ===Interactions with other nations=== The Kipchaks frequently came into conflict with the Kievan Rus' principalities to the northwest and the Khwarezmian Empire to the southeast. These encounters ranged from trading interactions to outright warfare, with Kipchak forces often acting as mercenaries for regional powers. However, the most significant challenge the Kipchaks faced was from the Mongol Empire. In the early 13th century, the Mongols launched a series of devastating invasions into Kipchak territories, eventually defeating them around 1237–1240 and bringing their territory under Mongol colonization. ===Kipchaks across Eurasia=== Many Kipchaks fled westward following the Mongol invasions, seeking refuge in Eastern European territories, where they allied with regional polities or were integrated into them. Some were taken as captives to Egypt, where they served as soldiers in the Mamluk Sultanate. Kipchak soldiers played a vital role in the Mamluk army, ultimately rising to positions of power, and even establishing a Kipchak- dominated ruling elite in the Mamluk Sultanate. ==Society== Kipchak society was highly mobile and structured around clans and tribal alliances. Like many other nomadic cultures, they were skilled horsemen, archers, and warriors. Their economy was primarily based on animal husbandry, particularly the raising of sheep, cattle, and horses. ===Lifestyle=== This supported their nomadic lifestyle. The Kipchaks were skilled craftsmen, producing leather goods, textiles, and other tradeable items. The Kipchaks adhered to a shamanistic belief system rooted in the natural world, though they later came into contact with Islam and Christianity through their interactions with neighboring states. ===Religions=== Some Kipchaks converted to Christianity under Byzantine influence, while others adopted Islam, especially after their integration into Muslim polities such as the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. ==Language== The Kipchak language, a branch of the Turkic language family, influenced many languages across Eastern Europe, particularly during their interaction with neighboring states. Over time, the language contributed to the development of various Turkic dialects spoken across the region, including languages still spoken in modern Russia and Central Asia, such as Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Tatar. ==Legacy== Today, the Kipchaks' legacy endures in the ethnic and linguistic makeup of regions they once dominated. The Kipchak identity was eventually absorbed by other Turkic and Slavic groups, but their influence can still be observed in the cultural traditions, languages, and historical records of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. ==Related pages== * Tocharians * Middle Ages * Seljuk Empire * Song Dynasty * Turkic languages * Mamluk Sultanate ==More reading== * Golden, Peter B.
