 "text": "In geometry, bisection is the division of something into two equal parts. This is usually done by a line, which we will call the \"bisector\". The most known types are the segment bisector (a line that passes through the middle of a given segment) and the angle bisector (a line that passes through the apex of an angle, that divides it into two equal angles. In three-dimensional space, bisection is usually done by a plane, which is also called the bisector or bisecting plane. Category:Geometry",
