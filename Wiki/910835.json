Vair was involved in a lawnmower accident at her parents' house in Cardston in 2018. Because of the remote location, the paramedics arrived almost an hour later. Her right leg had to be amputated below the knee and she underwent reconstruction on her left heel. Vair started with wheelchair basketball in 2019 and made her debut for the national team in 2019. == References == Category:1998 births Category:Canadian sitting volleyball players Category:Living people",
