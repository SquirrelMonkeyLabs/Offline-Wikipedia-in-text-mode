 "text": "Shugendō is a religion that originated in Japan during the Nara Period. It combines beliefs, philosophies, doctrines, and ritual systems from local folk religions, Shinto mountain worship, and Buddhism. Shugendō is a highly syncretic religion and is considered a body of ascetic practices. The goal of Shugendō is for practitioners to find supernatural power and save themselves and others by conducting religious training while walking through steep mountain ranges. Those who practice Shugendō are called Shugenja or Yamabushi, which means \"Mountain Prostrator\". The practice of Shugendō takes place on mountains all over Japan, including various mountains in the Ōmine mountain range, such as Mount Hakkyō and Mount Ōmine. The Shugendō worldview incorporates a vast array of deities, including figures from both Buddhism and Shintoism. Two significant figures are the tantric Buddhist deities of Fudō Myōō and Dainichi Nyorai.Miyake Hitoshi. \"Religious Rituals in Shugendo A Summary.\" Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 1989 16/2–3 Gongen is another essential figure in Shugendō, referring to the manifestation of Buddhas as Japanese Kami.
