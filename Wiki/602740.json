 "text": "María Cristina del Pino Segura Gómez, known as Pinito del Oro (6 November 1930 - 25 October 2017), was a Spanish trapeze artist and novelist. She was known for her association with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus for seven years. She was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. Cecil B. DeMille tried to hire Pinito for a movie about the circus, but she rejected it because DeMille did not want her to appear on the credits. In addition to the circus performances, Pinito del Oro found time to publish some novels: Born for the Circus (Nacida para el circo) , The Eve (La víspera) and The Italian (El italiano). With them, she was a finalist in some literary contests such as the \"City of Oviedo\" and \"Blasco Ibañez\". Pinito del Oro died on 25 October 2017 at her home in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria from stroke-related complications at the age of 86. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Spanish novelists Category:Spanish entertainers",
