 "text": "A mouse trap is a type of animal trap designed to catch mice. Some traps do not kill mice, while others do kill mice. It usually attracts mice if there is cheese or peanut butter on the mouse trap. It can also be used to trap other animals such as maggots. However, if too much food is put on the mouse trap, they can eat it without getting caught. == References == Category:Traps",
