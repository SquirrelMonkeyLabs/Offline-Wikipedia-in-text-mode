Akon said that was inspired by the Bob Marley songs \"No Woman, No Cry\" and \"Zimbabwe\". He said that the feeling of the song is as if the listener is \"in a position when you're trying to hold a relationship together but the people around you don't really want it\", he also said that \"the record still has a chorus that make you feel good. So I think those attributes probably stem from that subliminal standpoint\". A music video for the song was released. In the video, Akon is on a date and singing the song. Pitbull also appears in the video. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2007 songs Category:Akon songs Category:R&B; songs",
