 "text": "Communications-based train control (CBTC) is a railway signaling system that makes use of telecommunications between the train and track equipment. By means of a CBTC system, the exact position of a train is known more accurately than with the traditional signaling systems. This results in a more efficient and safe way to manage trains. Metros (and other railway systems) are able to run more frequent trains while maintaining or even improving safety.Join Now Category:Rail technologies",
