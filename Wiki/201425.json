This means that used items are not thrown away while they are still useful to someone. This is to make sure that less garbage is thrown into landfills, so that these landfills can have more space and last longer. In October 2009, there were more than 200 Freegle groups with more than 920,000 members in the UK. ==References== == Other websites == * Freegle website Category:Environmental organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Recycling",
