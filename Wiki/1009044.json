 "text": "The Yaoshan whipping frog or Yaoshan tree frog (Zhangixalus yaoshanensis) is a frog. It lives in China in Guangxi Province. People have seen it between 800 and 1500 meters above sea level, in the Dayaoshan Mountains. It usually lives near bodies of water that do not dry out. This frog lives in forests. Scientists think the tadpoles swim in water. Scientists do not think this frog is at risk of dying out, but they think human beings coming into its forests to take away wood might make some problems, but there is less of this now than there was in the early 2000s. One of the places the frog lives is a protected park: Dayaoshan Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
