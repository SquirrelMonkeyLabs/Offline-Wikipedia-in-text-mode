 "text": "\"Girls, Girls, Girls\" is a single by the American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe. It is the first single from the album of the same name, released on May 11, 1987 and peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at #12 and #20 on the Mainstream rock charts. American pop artist Lady GaGa wrote the song \"Boys Boys Boys\" as an homage to this song. ==Music video== Mötley Crüe\"s first video of \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" was banned from MTV due to nudity, it was shot at the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles. There was trouble when finding a location because most strip clubs did not serve alcohol. The dancers were from mainly the Tropicana which was Vince Neil's favourite club and the Seventh Veil. The song and album were both written during a time when main songwriter Nikki Sixx, and co-writer Dominic Catanzarito were both addicted to heroin. Category:1987 songs Category:Mötley Crüe songs",
