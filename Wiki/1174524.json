 "text": "The Mayorga rocket frog (Aromobates mayorgai) is a frog. It lives in MÃ©rida, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams high in cloud forests in the Andes mountains. Scientists saw the frog between 793 and 2400 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in Protective Zone of the Capaz River and the place where the frog lives is near La Culata National Park. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on dead leaves on the ground. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make towns and farms and places for people to raise animals. Chemicals that kill pests and make plants grow can also hurt this frog. Scientists have not found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on this frog, so they do not know for sure that it can give the frogs the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, but they did find it on other frogs nearby. People also brought the bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus to the place where A. mayorgai lives, and the bullfrog can eat the same food as A. mayorgai and eat the A. mayorgai frogs themselves. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
