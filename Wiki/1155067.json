 "text": "Friday the 17th is a date that occurs when the 17th day of a month falls on a Friday. It is considered unlucky in Italy and some other parts of Southern Europe. This superstition has roots in religion, history, and the symbolism of the number 17 in Italian culture. While it might seem unusual compared to Friday the 13th in English-speaking countries, the reasons for the superstition are deeply embedded in Italian tradition. ==Why Is the Number 17 Unlucky?== # Roman Numerals and Death #* In Roman numerals, the number 17 is written as XVII. #* When rearranged, it can form the word VIXI, which in Latin means \"I have lived\" (implying \"I am dead\"). #* This association with death and bad luck makes 17 an ominous number in Italian culture. # Biblical Connections #* According to some interpretations, the Great Flood described in the Bible began on the 17th day of the second month. This adds a layer of misfortune to the number in religious contexts. #* Friday itself has religious significance as the day of Jesus' crucifixion in Christian tradition, making the combination of Friday and 17 doubly unlucky. # Numerology #* In Italian numerology, 17 is often associated with imbalance or disruption. It is seen as less \"complete\" than numbers like 16 or 18, which symbolize harmony or success. ==Why Friday?== * Friday has long been considered an unlucky day in Christian traditions because it is believed to be the day of Jesus' crucifixion. * The combination of Friday (a traditionally unlucky day) and 17 (an unlucky number in Italy) creates a day considered particularly inauspicious. ==Occurrence== The 17th falls on a Friday in months that begin on a Wednesday. There is at least one Friday the 17th in every calendar year but there can be up to three in one year. ===Frequency=== The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 17th is 14 months, either from July in a Leap year starting on Wednesday or Common year starting on Thursday to September of the following year being a Common year starting on Friday (e.g. 1998-1999, 2009-2010, 2020-2021 and 2026-2027) or from August in a Common year starting on Monday to October the following year being a Leap year starting on Tuesday (e.g. 2007-2008 and 2035-2036). The shortest period between two Friday the 17ths is 1 month from February to March in a Common year starting on Sunday (e.g. 1995, 2006, 2017 and 2023). ===Frequency within a single year=== There can be no more than three Friday the 17ths in one year. This happens in the months of February, March and November in a Common year starting on Sunday (e.g. 1995, 2006, 2017 and 2023) and January, April and July in a Leap year starting on Wednesday (e.g. 1992, 2020 and 2048). In the 1990s, there was one Friday the 17th in 1990, 1991, 1994 and 1996, two in 1993, 1997, 1998 and 1999 and three in 1992 and 1995 for a total of 18 Friday the 17ths in the 1990s. In the 2000s, there was one Friday the 17th in 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2008, two in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2009, and three in 2006 for a total of 16 Friday the 17ths in the 2000s. In the 2010s, there was one Friday the 17th in 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018 and 2019, two in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2015 and three in 2017 for a total of 16 Friday the 17ths in the 2010s. In the 2020s there was one Friday the 17th in 2022 and 2024, two in 2021, and three in 2020 and 2023. There will be one Friday the 17th in 2029 and two in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 for a total of 19 Friday the 17ths in the 2020s. This shows that the the frequency of Friday the 17ths has decreased from the 1990s to the 2010s but increased again in the 2020s. Category:Superstitious dates",
