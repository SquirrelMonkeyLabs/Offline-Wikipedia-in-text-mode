Frank Norris). ==Birthplace of Route 66== Springfield is called the \"Birthplace of U.S. Route 66\". It was in Springfield on April 30, 1926 that officials first proposed the name of the new Chicago-to-Los Angeles highway. John T. Woodruff of Springfield was elected as the first president of the U.S. Highway 66 Association. It was organized in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1927. Its purpose was to get U.S. 66 paved from end to end and to promote tourism on the highway. In 1938, Route 66 became the first completely paved United States Numbered Highways in America. Called the “Mother Road”, it stretched from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Coast. A placard in Park Central Square was dedicated to the city by the Route 66 Association of Missouri. Traces of the Mother Road are still visible in Downtown Springfield along Kearney Street, Glenstone Avenue, College and St. Louis streets and on Missouri 266 to Halltown. The red booths and gleaming chrome in mom and pop diners, the stone cottages of tourist courts and the many service stations along this route saw America fall in love with the automobile. Red's Giant Hamburg, said to be the birthplace of the drive-up order window, was located on the route. == References == == Other websites == *City of Springfield *Springfield Convention & Visitors Bureau *Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce *Live in Springfield, MO * Historic maps of Springfield in the Sanborn Maps of Missouri Collection at the University of Missouri Category:Christian County, Missouri Category:County seats in Missouri Category:Ozarks Category:Settlements in Christian County, Missouri",
