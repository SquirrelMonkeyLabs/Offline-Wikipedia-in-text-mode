 "text": "Alagir is a city in the North Ossetia-Alania Republic in southern Russia. It is located in the Caucausus Mountains areas of Russia. == Brief occupation by the Nazi German military army troops == Alagir was briefly occupied by Nazi German military army troops from 1 November to 24 December 1942, during the German invasion of the Caucausus obviously in World War II. It is the southernmost known and proven point of occupation in the Caucasus areas, which can be proven with certainty and confirmation, without disputes, though areas of occupation could have extended farther south, in the Caucausus Russia areas, and probably into the very northern parts of Georgian SFSR, though this is a unconfirmed urban legend story (please see this on the Simple English Wikipedia article and page of Georgia.). Alagir was liberated early on 24 December 1942 by the Soviet Bolshevik Red Army of the Soviet Union. Category:Cities and towns in Russia Category:North Ossetiaâ€“Alania",
