 "text": "Sperm theft also known as forced fatherhood, spermjacking or spurgling (a mix of sperm and burgling), happens when a man's sperm is used, against his will or without his permission, to get a woman pregnant. It can also happen when someone lies about their use of contraceptives or when a man or boy is sexually assaulted. In most places, sperm theft is not illegal. It is an issue for men's rights campaigners. ==Citations== Category:Biological reproduction",
