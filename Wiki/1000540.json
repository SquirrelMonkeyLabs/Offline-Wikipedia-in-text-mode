 "text": "The Constitution of Ireland gives authority to a government which is headed by the Taoiseach, the head of government. The government is made up of ministers, each of whom must be a member of the Oireachtas, which consists of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. The government is dependent on the Oireachtas to pass laws and so it needs a majority in the Dáil for budgets and government bills to pass. The government runs the public administration in Ireland. In 2022 there were about 372,000 people working for it. == References ==",
