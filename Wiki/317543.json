 "text": "Riebeckite is a silicate mineral. It is found in nature as both a fibrous form and a solid form. The fibrous form, called blue asbestos or crocidolite asbestos, is one of the six types of asbestos. It is considered by many experts to be the most dangerous type of asbestos. It can cause cancer and asbestosis. It was formerly used in Kent brand cigarettes as a filter material. It is rare in construction compared to white asbestos, but it is sometimes found in caulking, cement, wallboard, rope, and numerous other products. Due to its hazards, blue asbestos is no longer mined commercially. ==Related pages== *List of minerals ==Sources== ==Other websites== * Category:Asbestos Category:Inosilicates",
