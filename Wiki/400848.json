 "text": "Glen or Glenda is a 1953 movie about a male transvestite. It was written and directed by Ed Wood. It stars Ed Wood as Glen and Glenda, and features Bela Lugosi and Wood's then-girlfriend Dolores Fuller. The movie was inspired by the Christine Jorgensen's sex reassignment surgery in 1952. George Weiss was a Hollywood producer of low-budget films. He wanted a movie made to exploit the event. He made Jorgensen several offers to appear in the movie. These offers were turned down. This was the only movie Wood directed but did not also produce. Wood himself played the title character, but under the pseudonym \"Daniel Davis\". Lugosi is credited as \"The Scientist\". He acts as a sort of narrator but gives no narration relevant to the plot. ==Cast== * Timothy Farrell as Narrator / Dr. Alton * Ed Wood (credited as \"Daniel Davis\") as Glen/Glenda * Dolores Fuller as Barbara * Bela Lugosi as The Scientist * Lyle Talbot as Inspector Warren * \"Tommy\" Haynes as Alan/Anne * Charles Crafts as Johnny * Conrad Brooks as Banker / Reporter / Pickup artist / Bearded drag ==Story== Glen is shown looking at women's clothes in a shop window.
