 "text": "T10 cricket is a form of cricket where both teams have one innings of 10 overs each, and the game lasts about 90 minutes.https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/gloucestershire/t10_cricket_league_2018_all_you_need_to_know.html\"T10? How does that work? Take the T20 cricket format, and then just cut it in half. Each side bowls 10 overs, with each bowler allowed to bowl a maximum of two overs. Powerplays are slightly longer proportionately with the first four overs, rather than six in T20, constituting a powerplay in which no more than two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle.\" A few T10 leagues have been started, such as the T10 League in Abu Dhabi. ==References== Category:Minor forms of cricket",
