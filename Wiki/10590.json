He is the Absolute truth (Parabrahman), Supreme self (Paramatma) and Ultimate reality in Vaishnavism, the largest denomination of Hinduism. He is considered as one of the principal deities, generally a representation of the Trimurti, the supreme trinity of Hinduism. He is venerated as the Supreme Being in Vaishnavism and as Purushottama or Supreme Purusha in many ancient sacred texts like the Vedas, Puranas, Ramayana, Mahabharata (including Bhagavad Gita), etc. The Vishnu Sahasranama declares Vishnu as Paramatma (supreme soul) and Parameshvara (supreme god). It describes Vishnu as the all-pervading essence of all beings, the master of—and beyond—the past, present, future, the creator, preserver, destroyer of all existences, one who supports, preserves, sustains, governs, rules the universe and originates and develops all elements within. Vishnu is also venerated as Mukunda, the supreme god who is the giver of mukti (liberation from the cycle of rebirths) to his devotees, the worthy ones who deserve salvation from the material world. According to the Bhagavad Gita, he is the \"Teacher of the Universe\". The Bhagavata Purana declares that Narayana as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who engages in the creation of 14 worlds within the universe as Brahma, who is the god of rajas-guna, who engages in the preservation of 14 worlds within the universe as Vishnu, who is the god of sattvas-guna, who engages in the destruction of 14 worlds within the universe as Shiva, who is the god of tamas-guna. This Narayana is Vishnu himself, who incarnates in various avataras. In the Bhagavata Purana, Purusha Sukta, Narayana Sukta, Narayana Upanishad, Mahanarayana Upanishad, he is the absolute truth. Vishnu is the god of preservation. This means that he protects the universe from being destroyed. It is believed that Vishnu holds the Earth and all living organisms.
