Lee won gold medals in the pommel horse event in the 2017 Taipei Universiade and the 2018 Indonesia Asian Games. == Gymnastic career == === Childhood and Adolescence === Lee Chih-Kai was born in Yilan County, Taiwan. He started training as an artistic gymnast at six years old when he met his coach, Lin Yu-Shin. Lee joined the gymnastic team when he studied in Gong Jheng Elementary School in Luo-Dong Township. Lee was nicknamed “Market boy Kai” because he liked to perform his gymnastic skills in the traditional market where his parents worked.1Xiao-Heng Shi, “Dream to participate in the international competition, the teacher in the elementary school says: Lee Chih-Kai has been approaching his dream” [in Chinese], The Storm Media, August 23, 2017, accessed November 11, 2018, http://www.businesstoday.com.tw/article-content-80417-156298. At the beginning of his career, Lee started practicing a difficult element named “Thomas Flairs”, which was commonly performed on the floor in gymnastics. Because of his coach's suggestion, Lee moved the Thomas Flairs into his pommel horse routine when he studied in the middle school.Shelly Shan, “Taipei Universiade: Lee Chih-kai Spins to Victory,” Taipei Times, August 25, 2017, accessed November 11, 2018, http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/08/25/2003677144. When Lee Chih-Kai was 15, he left his hometown and moved to Taoyuan city, where Lin Yu-Shin coached a university gymnastic team. Lee practiced with the team in the early morning before going to school and returned to the gym after school. During high school he practiced at least 8 hours per day. His coach said that Lee was not the most talented gymnast, but was the most hard-working.Chun-Yi Hsieh, “co-living with injuries for 15 years Lee Chih-Kai won the golden medal with hard working” [in Chinese], Next Magazine, August 30, 2017, accessed November 11, 2018, https://www.nextmag.com.tw/realtimenews/news/342456 Yu- Hsieh Lin, ”’Jump Series’: Director write about the 15 years with Lee Chih-Kai and the coach”[in Chinese], Business Weekly, August 31, 2017, accessed November 11, 2018, https://www.businessweekly.com.tw/Archive/Article/Index?StrId=65341#_=_.

In April 2016, Lee passed the Olympic Test Events and qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympic games. He was the first gymnast to qualify for the Olympics since the 2000 Sydney Olympic games. Lee was diagnosed with a broken right shinbone and a sprained right ankle one month before the Olympics. Lee lost the chance to move to the finals because these injuries affected his performance. After the failure in the Olympic game, Lee started training overseas. In addition, his coach helped him adapt to stressful environments by imitating the crowds and noisy environment when he was practicing. In August 2017, Lee Chih-Kai won the gold medal in the pommel horse event in the Taipei Universiade by performing his signature “Thomas Flairs” movement in the routine. Lee was the first Taiwanese male gymnast to win the gold medal in the pommel horse event. With this win, he broke his best personal record in international competitions.7the Taipei 2017 Summer Universiade Organizing Committee (TUOC), “Results - Men’s Pommel Horse Final”, Taipei 2017 29th Summer Universiade, August 23, 2017, accessed November 12, 2018, https://data.2017.gov.taipei/atos/prod/chn/ga/chnga_gymnastics-artistic- results-men-s-pommel-horse-1-00.htm Lee's Thomas Flairs movement has been included in the teaching template of the International Federation of Gymnastics.
