His parents, Lily and James Potter, were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort, while Voldemort was trying to kill Harry. Yet Harry escaped with no harm except a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt, and Voldemort ends up dead or is he? Harry is raised by his non-magical Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin (Dudley), and is mistreated by them. He believes the false words of the Dursleys that Harry's parents were killed in a car crash. As a child, he did not know that he was a wizard. He eventually discovers that there are many magical people, living secretly and hiding from non-wizards (known as \"Muggles\"). When Harry turned eleven on July 31, he received a letter inviting him to go to a school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards. Each book tells the story of one year of his life at the school and tells how he struggles. On Hogwarts Express, the train they use to get to Hogwarts, he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who become his best friends. Harry also later meets Myrtle Warren, a ghost, who also becomes his friend. Voldemort tries several times to return to life and kill Harry. In the fourth book, Voldemort comes to life with help from his follower, Peter Pettigrew. The series ends with an epic battle between Harry and Lord Voldemort and a final epilogue that shows Harry and his friends safe and happy with their partners and children. == Books == * 1997 - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) * 1998 - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets * 1999 - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban * 2000 - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire * 2003 - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix * 2005 - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince * 2007 - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows === Secondary books === * 2001 - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them * 2001 - Quidditch Through the Ages * 2007 - The Tales of Beedle the Bard * 2016 - Harry Potter and the Cursed Child == Adaptations == The seven books were all adapted into different forms of media, including toys, movies, spin-off movies, television series, specials, video games, and a stage play as well. === Movies === * 2001 – Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone / Sorcerer's Stone * 2002 – Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets * 2004 – Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban * 2005 – Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire * 2007 – Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix * 2009 – Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince * 2010 – Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 * 2011 – Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 ==== Spin-off movies ==== * 2016 - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them * 2018 - Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald *2022 - Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore ==== Television series and specials ==== * 2022 - Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts * 2022 - Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses * 2024–present - Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking * 2026 - Harry Potter === Video games === * 2001 - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone / Sorcerer's Stone (Released for PC, Mac, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance) * 2002 - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Released for PC, Mac, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance) * 2003 - Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup (Released for Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube) * 2004 - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Released for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance) * 2005 - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Released for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance) * 2007 - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Released for PC, Mac, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance) * 2009 - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Released for PC, Mac, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, and Mobile) * 2010 - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (Released for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, and Mobile) * 2011 - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (Released for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS) ==== Other games ==== * 2001 - Lego Creator: Harry Potter (Released for Microsoft Windows) * 2002 - Lego Creator: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Released for Microsoft Windows) * 2004 - Harry Potter: Find Scabbers (Released for Mobile) * 2007 - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: The Mobile Game (Released for Mobile) * 2008 - Harry Potter: Mastering Magic (Released for Mobile) * 2009 - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: The Mobile Game (Released for Mobile) * 2009 - Harry Potter: Spells (Released for iOS) * 2010 - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Motorbike Escape (Free online game) * 2010 - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1: The Mobile Game (Released for Mobile) * 2010 - Scene it?

Some of them are from mythology and others Rowling wrote herself. Some of these magical creatures have their own culture and some are like animals. According to the real-world book, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Ministry of Magic makes three groups of creatures: Being, Beast and Spirit. Beings are creatures like humans and house elves, who are smart enough to manage their own business and Beasts are not. *Centaurs live in the Forbidden Forest near the school. They are smart and study the stars. They are proud and do not like it when humans bother them. Even though centaurs are smart enough to be called \"Being\" by the Ministry of Magic, they asked to be called \"Beast\" instead because that meant more humans would leave them alone. There is a Centaur Liaison Office at the Ministry of Magic, but no one ever uses it. *Mermaids live in the lake near the school. They speak a language called Mermish and have scary faces. *House Elves work in the school and for wizarding families. They cook and clean. A house elf can only be freed if its owner gives it clothes. Otherwise, they wear pillowcases, tea towels or other cloth that is not clothing. House Elves have their own kind of magic, which is very strong. *Veela can look like beautiful women or like winged creatures with scary faces. They can throw fireballs and magically appear attractive to human men. *Giants are large and brutal. Human beings hunted them so that now they have to live close together in mountains. Some giants can have children with humans. *Werewolves are humans who have been bitten by another werewolf. Other humans act as if they have a dangerous disease. There are laws saying they can only work in certain places. Wizards and non-wizards can be werewolves. *Ghosts are dead people who are gray and transparent. There are ghosts at Hogwarts who talk to the students. The history teacher is a ghost. *Phoenixes are fire birds. They catch fire once every five hundred days and come out of the ashes a young baby bird again. Their tears can heal even an almost dead person. In the second book, a phoenix saved harry from the Basilisk, another venomous creature. In the books, Dumbledore has a pet phoenix named Fawkes. *Vampires are magical creatures of the night which appear in the series only sporadically. The only known vampire in the Harry Potter series is Sanguini. *Leprechauns are magical beings; tiny, bearded men, they are the official mascots of the Irish National Quidditch Team. == References == == Other websites == === Official sites === * J.K.
