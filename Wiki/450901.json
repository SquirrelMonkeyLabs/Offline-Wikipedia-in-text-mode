 "text": "In mathematics (particularly in differential calculus), a differential operator is an operator that takes a function as input, and returns a function as a result. Differential operators will differentiate the function in one or more variables. Probably the best known differential operator is differentiation itself, which is commonly written using \\tfrac{d}{dx} (in Leibniz's notation) and D (in Euler's notation). == Related pages == * Divergence * Laplace operator == References == Category:Mathematics",
