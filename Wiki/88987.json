 "text": "Tube sound (or valve sound) is the sound produced by a vacuum tube-based audio amplifier. All amplifiers distort to some degree; some audiophiles prefer the sound produced by tube amplifiers. The reasons for the difference in sound between tube and solid state electronic devices is a continuing debate among audiophiles. == References == *Hamm, Russell O. Tubes Vs.
