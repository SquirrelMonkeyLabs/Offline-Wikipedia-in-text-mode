 "text": "Jaffa Gate (, Sha'ar Yafo; , Bab el-Khalil, \"Gate of the Friend\"; also Bab Mihrab Daud, \"Gate of the Prayer Niche of David\"; also called David's Gate) is a stone archway in the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. It is along one of the main roads that connects the western part of the city to the Western Wall and the Temple Mount above him. The plaza of the Jaffa Gate replaced a tall Roman pillar inside the Damascus Gate, which was used as the starting point for measurements to other cities in Palestine. It later became the starting point used to measure the distances to other countries. The Tower of David is a structure of the citadel, and is used today as the History of Jerusalem Museum. The road fro Jaffa Gate to the Western Wall called once the Capital street. == Structures in Jaffa Gate == File:Torredavide230413 0231 (6).jpg|the Tower of David (the Citadel) File:Jaffa Gate Jerusalem 03.JPG|Kilometre Zero of Israel File:Jerusalem Jaffa Gate-19th-clock.jpg|The Turkish Clock Tower (demolished) File:Migdal david008.jpg|the Bezalel Pavilion (demolished) File:Jaffa Gate from Outside.
