 "text": "Apomixis is reproduction where only one parent passes genes to the offspring.King R.C. Stansfield W.D. & Mulligan P.K. 2006. A dictionary of genetics. 7th ed, Oxford University Press, p31. Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent (clones). The method is most seen in plants, especially flowering plants.Gustafsson A. 1945. Apomixis in the higher plants. I.

Variation and evolution in plants, p382 et seq. Brambles (blackberry) are apomictic. Some authorities give \"reproduction by special tissues without fertilisation\",Encyclopedia Britannica or \"asexual formation of a seed from the maternal tissues of the ovule, avoiding meiosis and fertilization, leading to embryo development\".Bicknell R.A. & Koltunow A.M. 2004. Understanding apomixis: recent advances and remaining conundrums. The Plant Cell, 16, suppl 1, S228-S245. Apomixis includes some methods which are more common in animals, such as parthenogenesis. In botany, apomixis was defined by Hans Winkler as the replacement of the normal sexual reproduction by asexual reproduction, without fertilization.Ross A. Bicknell & Anna M. Koltunow 2004. Understanding apomixis: recent advances and remaining conundrums. The Plant Cell 16 (suppl 1): S228â€“S245. doi:10.1105/tpc.017921. PMC 2643386. PMID 15131250 Horticulture methods, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, is not apomixis. Natural replacement of the seed by an asexual method is apomixis. == References == Category:Genetics Category:Methods of reproduction",
