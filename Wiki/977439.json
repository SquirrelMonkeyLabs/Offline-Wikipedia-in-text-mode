 "text": "Moombahton (, ) is a fusion genre. It mixes house music, african music and reggaeton. It was created by American DJ and producer Dave Nada in Washington, D.C., in 2009. ==History== Moombahton was created by Dave Nada in late 2009. It was while he was DJing his cousin's high school cut party in Washington, D.C.. He blended the house and club music which he had planned to play with the dancehall and bachata. The guests were listening to them by slowing down Afrojack's remix of Silvio Ecomo and Chuckie's \"Moombah!\" from 128 BPM to 108 BPM, to create the basis of the genre. Between late 2009 and early 2010, Nada worked on a five track extended play of moombahton tracks that was released in March 2010, with the support of the DJ Ayres and the DJ Tittsworth at T&A; Records. Though not referred to as moombahton, the concept of combining reggae/dancehall/reggaeton percussion with electronic elements dates back further than Dave Nada. Examples of artists which previously fused Latin and electronic dance music include Nadia Oh, El General, Masters at Work, Munchi, Luny Tunes, Jowell & Randy. Moombahton has also been incorporated into existing styles of music. It creates derivative genres such as moombahcore. That was a genre fusing the tempo and percussion of moombahton with the distorted sounds of modern dubstep. In January 2012, Beatport created a chart for the top moombahton songs of 2011. Moombahton creator Nada and collaborator Matt Nordstrom as Nadastrom (who toured with Skrillex in 2011) are currently based in Los Angeles but return regularly to DC to play the Moombahton Massive parties they established in 2010 at U Street Music Hall.Moombahton settles in L.A. after becoming D.C.'s first breakout electronic music genre , by Jeff Weiss, April 23, 2013, The Washington Post == References == Category:Fusion music genres Category:Reggaeton Category:2010s in music",
