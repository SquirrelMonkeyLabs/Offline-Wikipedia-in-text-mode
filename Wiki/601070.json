 "text": "The President of the Republic of Liberia is the head of state and government of Liberia. The president serves as the leader of the executive branch and as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia. The current President is Joseph Boakai since January 22, 2024. ==History== Between 1847 and 1980, the presidency was exclusively held by Americo-Liberians, the original American settlers of Liberia and their descendants. The original two-party system, with the Republican Party and the True Whig Party, ended in 1878, when the election of Anthony W. Gardiner marked the beginning of 102 years of single-party rule by the True Whigs. Under the 1986 Constitution, the president is directly elected by eligible voters to a six-year term, which may be renewed once. Overall, 22 individuals have served as president. On January 22, 2018, George Weah was sworn in as the twenty-fifth and current president. ==Terms== Under the original 1847 Constitution, the president was elected to a two-year term, which was increased to four years on May 7, 1907. Under this amendment, a new president would serve for eight years and could be re-elected to unlimited four-year terms. Currently, the president is elected by popular vote to a six- year term and is limited to two terms. ==Eligibility== To be eligible for office under the current Constitution, a presidential candidate must: *be a natural born citizen of Liberia (per Art, 27(b) of the Constitution, citizenship is limited to \"persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent\"); *be at least thirty-five years old; *own real property valued at least $25,000; *have resided in Liberia for at least ten years. ==List of presidents of Liberia== N Portrait President Term of office Party Took office Left office 1 Joseph Jenkins Roberts Independent 2 Nathaniel Brander January 7, 1849 January 7, 1849 Independent (1) Joseph Jenkins Roberts January 7, 1849 January 7, 1853 Independent 3 Anthony D.
