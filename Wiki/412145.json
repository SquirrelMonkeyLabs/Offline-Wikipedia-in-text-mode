 "text": "Bad Piggies is a puzzle video game developed by Rovio Entertainment. Players have to help the green pigs to steal the egg of the Angry Birds, a game that's also developed by Rovio. Being a spin-off of Angry Birds, the players control the pigs instead of the birds. The game was last updated on October 23, 2023. == Gameplay == In the main story mode, each level has a different mission. Players have to build a vehicles for a freckled pig named Ross. As players play through the game, new materials can be unlocked. For example, at the beginning of the game, the player only receives wooden blocks and wheels, while in later levels, more materials such as engines and different wheels are unlocked. Like Angry Birds, three stars can be achieved at the end of the level. Unlike the original game, there is no score. Stars are achieved by doing missions, with one being for getting Ross to the finish line. The game has two alternate modes: Sandbox and Cake Race. Sandbox is a set of open-world levels without a goal where players can use parts unlocked in story levels to build any vehicle possible. In Cake Race, the player builds a vehicle to collect as many cakes in a level as possible before a computer player can. Both players are required to carry a batch of dynamite that explodes when the level ends. == Reception == == References == == Other websites == * () Category:2012 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Fictional pigs Category:Free-to-play video games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Windows games",
