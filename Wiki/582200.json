 "text": "Morelia amethistina (also known as the amethystine python, scrub python or sanca permata) is a form of non-venomous python. It can be found in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia. Some specimens of Morelia amethistina have been measured at up to 8.5 metres (27.9 feet) long, but normally they are only up to 5 metres long. The diet of the Amethystine python is mostly birds, bats, rats, possums, and other small mammals. Some big Australian and Papuan varieties eat wallabies and cuscus.
