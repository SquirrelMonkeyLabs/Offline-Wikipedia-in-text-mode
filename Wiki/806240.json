 "text": "The no-hair theorem is about black holes. Black holes can be described by just three visible properties: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum, or spin. The theory itself was first stated by Werner Israel, a Canadian physicist. Then John Archibald Wheeler said that black holes have no hairs. This gave the idea its name. What he meant was: except for these three properties, no other properties can be got from a black hole. Misner, Charles W; Thorne, Kip S. & Wheeler, John Archibald 1973. Gravitation.
