 "text": "Matthias Corvinus (also Mátyás Corvin ; 23 February 1443 – 6 April 1490) was a king of Hungary and Croatia who reigned from 1458 to 1490. He was also king of Bohemia since 1469 and ruled the lands of Moravia, Silesia, and Lusatia. Matthias adopted the title Duke of Austria. As an avid reader and culture lover, he generously patronized arts. He invited many artists from Italian city-states (such as Galeotto Marzio ) and Western Europe were all invited to his royal palace and bestowed many gifts. He spoke Hungarian, Romanian, Croatian and Latin well, and later studied German and Czechoslovak. == Other websites == Category:History of Hungary",
