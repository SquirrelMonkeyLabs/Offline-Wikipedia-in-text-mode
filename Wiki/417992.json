They can develop where a stream, river, or ocean current deposits sediment and granular material. Shoals look like a coastal landform in the sea. They are classified as a type of ocean bank, or as fluvial landforms in rivers, streams, and lakes. They are usually made up of sand. They can also be made up of soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders. Category:Landforms",
