 "text": "The McRib is a barbecue-flavored pork sandwich sold by the fast food restaurant chain McDonald's. It was first on the McDonald's menu in 1981, following testing the year before. After low sales it was removed from the menu in 1985. It was reintroduced in 1989 and stayed on the menu until 2005 in many countries. Since 2006, it has been made available for a short time each year where it is sold during the fall season, although it is a permanent menu item at McDonald's restaurants in Germany and Luxembourg. It was reintroduced again in late 2023 to some stores in the United States. ==Product description== The McRib consists of a restructured boneless pork patty shaped like a miniature rack of ribs, barbecue sauce, onions, and pickles, served as a sandwich on a roll. == In popular culture == The sandwich along with the cultural phenomenon of \"chasing the McRib\" were the subject of a subplot in The Simpsons episode \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\". It is parodied as the \"Ribwich\" and gains a cult following. ==References== Category:McDonald's foods Category:Sandwiches",
