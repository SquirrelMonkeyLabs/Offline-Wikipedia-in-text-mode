It was started by Marcion of Sinope in Rome. He believed in Jesus Christ but did not accept the Bible or Yahweh. He was a dualist and believed that the god who wrote the Old Testament was different from the god who wrote the New Testament. Traditionally, members were required to wear pointed-head garments to show reverence to the god of the Old Testament. ==References== ==Other websites== *Marcionite Research Library Category:Gnosticism",
