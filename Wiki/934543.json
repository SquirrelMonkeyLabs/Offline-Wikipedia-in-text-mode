 "text": "55 Cancri e is a superterran exoplanet made almost entirely of carbon, giving it the nickname the diamond planet or Lucy (from the Beatles song Lucy in the sky with diamonds). The planet orbits a sun like star just 2,400,000 kilometres from the star on average, pushing surface temperatures to an average of 2,575Â°K. The gravity of 55 Cancri e is around 15 times that of Earth, and the planet is tidally locked. The likelihood of diamonds on 55 Cancri e is due to the insane pressures on the planet. 55 Cancri E is also known of being up to double the size of Earth. Category:Exoplanets",
