 "text": "A hayride, which can also be called a hayrack ride, is an American activity where people go on a ride in an open truck, or wagon pulled by a tractor. Inside of the ride there is hay or straw for the people to sit on. Hayrides in the past were a way to celebrate the Autumn harvest. Hayrides today are usually started to give farms or companies a way to make more money during the fall. Sometimes hayrides are run by companies that help farms set up hayrides for people. == Haunted Hayrides == Hayrides on Halloween are called 'haunted hayrides'. During the fall, a hayride might let people stop near some pumpkins and pick one. These hayrides can put on a show with special effects and actors dressing up as ghosts, monsters, and other spooky creatures. Haunted hayrides attract people who like to get scared, and make money for farms during the Halloween season. == Accidents == Even though hayrides are supposed to be a way for people to have fun, they can also be dangerous. Some hayrides have flipped over or gone off-road, hurting or killing people. Other kinds of accidents happen when hayrides crash into cars or trucks on the road. == References == Category:Amusement rides",
