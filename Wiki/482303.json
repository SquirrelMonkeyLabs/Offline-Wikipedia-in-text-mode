 "text": "A trans man (sometimes written as trans-man) is a female-to-male (FTM) transsexual or transgender person. Many people in this group like the name trans man over the many medical terms that are out there. Other non-medical names are t-boy, tg-boy and ts-boy. Trans men were called girls when they were born, but they feel that they really are male. To show their true gender as men, trans men may transition from living as women to living as men. A trans man's transition can include telling family and friends, wearing different clothes, flattening the chest, using a new name, changing legal papers, using medical treatments of testosterone, and changing the body with surgery. Getting medical care can be more difficult for trans men because some doctors will not help them or they cannot afford it. Trans men can also face discrimination because they are transgender.James, S.E.; Herman, J.L.; Rankin, S.; Keisling, M.; Mottet, L.; Anafi, M. \"The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey\" (PDF). 2015 US Transgender Survey. National Center for Transgender Equality. Retrieved 15 June 2018. Not all trans men are straight (attracted to women). Some trans men are gay (attracted to men), bisexual, or asexual. Estimates of how many trans men there are range from 1 in every 30,000 people called girls at birth, to 1 in every 170 people called girls at birth. == Related pages == *Trans woman *Transmasculine ==References== *",
