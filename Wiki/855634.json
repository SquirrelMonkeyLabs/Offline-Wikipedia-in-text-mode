 "text": "Interpedia was the first-proposed online encyclopedia which would allow anyone to contribute by writing articles and submitting them to the central catalogue of all Interpedia pages. == History == Interpedia was initiated by Rick Gates, who posted a message titled \"The Internet Encyclopedia\" on October 25, 1993 to the PACS-L (Public-Access Computer Systems Forum) Listserv. That message included the following: : \"The more I thought about this, the more I realized that such a resource, containing general, encyclopedic knowledge for the layman, would be an important tool for some types of research, and for the Net.Citizenry in general. : \"Ahh.. but what about contributors... where will you find authors to write the short articles you need? Well, I'd first have to start out by finding some way of communicating with an extremely diverse set of people... everyone from linguists, to molecular biologists, from animal rights activists to zymurgists, and from geographers to gas chromotographers. Guess what? :-) The Net provides just such an arena! So I thought about it some more...and came to the conclusion that this is a good idea!\" == Related pages == * Online encyclopedia ==References== Category:Encyclopedia websites",
