The first chapel was a cave that Saint Goven lived in where the chapel is today. People believe that Saint Goven might be buried beneath the building. There is one entrance on the north part of the building. There are benches made of stone inside. The roof, which is made of slate is newer. To get to the building you have to walk down 52 stairs. ==References== Category:Churches in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Pembrokeshire Category:13th- century buildings and structures",
