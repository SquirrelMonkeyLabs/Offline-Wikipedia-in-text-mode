The player controls a virtual body that does what the player tells it to do and reacts to things it moves into in the game world. In Boneworks, players take on the role of Arthur Ford. He is a cybersecurity director who escapes into an unfinished simulated universe. He must fight through surreal architecture and mysterious scenes using experimental physics-based weaponry. His goal is to achieve immortality by breaking into the simulation to access itâ€™s source, the Voidway, and remove his real world presence. ==References== Category:2019 video games Category:HTC Vive games Category:Meta Quest games Category:Oculus Rift games Category:Sandbox games Category:First-person shooters Category:Single-player video games Category:Valve Index games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Virtual reality games Category:Windows games",
