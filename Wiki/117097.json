 "text": "The Cathedral of Santa Eulalia is the Gothic cathedral of Barcelona. The cathedral was constructed from the 13th to the 15th century. There was a Visigothic church there before. The Gothic-like façade is from the 19th century. The cathedral is dedicated to Eulalia of Barcelona, co-patron saint of Barcelona. According to Catholic tradition, Eulalia was a young virgin who suffered martyrdom during Roman times in Barcelona.One story is that she was exposed naked in the public square and a miraculous snow fall in mid spring covered her nudity. The enraged Romans put her into a barrel with knives stuck into it and rolled it down a street (according to tradition, the one now called 'Baixada de Santa Eulalia'). The body of Saint Eulalia is entombed in the cathedral's crypt. One side chapel is dedicated to \"Christ of Lepanto\", and contains a cross from a ship that fought at the Battle of Lepanto (1571). The body of the cross is shifted to the right. Catalan legend says that the body swerved to avoid getting hit by a cannonball. The cathedral has a secluded Gothic cloister where thirteen white geese are kept (it is said that Eulalia was 13 when she was murdered). == Images == image:Santaeulaliabarcelona224.jpg|Cathedral plan image:Porta claustre catedral de Barcelona.jpg|Cloisters door image:Capelles Bernardí i Roser catedral Barcelona.jpg|Chapels image:Barcelona Cathedral Interior - Ark of Santa Eulalia.jpg|Santa Eulàlia's Crypt Barcelona Cathedral - The fountain of the cloister.jpg|Cloister Barcelona Cathedral Interior - carved choir stalls.jpg|Choir seats at the Cathedral image:Garden06390019.JPG|The Cathedral Garden == References == == Other websites == * Official site ** Overview, with plan Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Spain Category:Buildings and structures in Barcelona Category:14th-century buildings and structures",
