 "text": "The EuroGames are sport event in Europe organized for gay, lesbian, trans and allies, that includes many (often 15-25) sports and related programs. Each year it is organized in different host city with support of EGLSF (European Gay and Lesbian Sport Federation) that manages its continuity. The EuroGames is most often a long weekend event with opening ceremonies, some of the sport, social and cultural activities (as side program) also happening on the days before. Similar to the Gay Games, EuroGames are a sports-for-all event, open for participation of people regardless of their gender, age, sexual identity or physical ability. Additionally it often included less prominent non-olympic sports and disciplines that are popular within LGBT+ communities like same-sex ballroom dance, line dance, cheerleading, aerobics, bodybuilding as well synchronised/artistic swimming with male participants. In terms of scale EuroGames range from 1,5 to cca 4 thousands participants primarily from the West and South of Europe but also elsewhere (often Asian and American diasporic communities). Most often it has extra support (scholarships/subsidies) for less privileged participants. ==References== == Other websites == * * European Gay And Lesbian Sport Federation * Archive of QueerSport.org - first European Gay And Lesbian Sports Guide Category:LGBT Category:Multi-sport events",
