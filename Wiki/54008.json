 "text": "Geir Ivarsøy (June 27, 1957 – March 9, 2006) was the main programmer at Opera Software. He and Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner were part of a research group at the Norwegian state telephone company (now known as Telenor). They made browsing software called MultiTorg Opera. Telenor stopped them from working on the program, but in 1995, Ivarsøy and Stephenson von Tetzchner got the rights to the software. They created a company of their own, and continued working on it. Now known as Opera, the Internet browser has become very popular. Opera Software has grown to more than 380 employees since it first moved to its offices in Oslo. In January 2004, Geir Ivarsøy said he wanted to resign as a board member in Opera Software, though he kept working in the company after that. In June 2005 he was elected as a member of the nomination committee of the company. Geir died in March 2006 of cancer. == Other websites == * Death in the Family—an obituary Category:Computer scientists Category:1957 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Opera ASA Category:Norwegian people",
