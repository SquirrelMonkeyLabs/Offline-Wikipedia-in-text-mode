It is the first hydroelectric dam built in Missouri. It was designed in 1911 by Nils F. Ambursen. Powersite was the largest concrete buttress dam of its kind. The dam is still privately owned by the Empire District Electric Company.Kathleen Van Buskirk, 'Powersite Dam', White River Valley Historical Quarterly, Volume 8, Number 8 (Summer 1984) In July 2015 the dam was damaged due to heavy flooding.
