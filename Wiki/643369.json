These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them gram-positive stains, and they have a second membrane. They are closer in structure to that of gram-negative bacteria. Cavalier-Smith calls this clade Hadobacteria (from Hades, the Greek underworld). == References == Category:Gram-positive bacteria",
