 "text": "Sicarii were killers who were a splinter group of the Zealots during the time leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman General Titus. Their name derives from a work that means \"dagger\". They hid in groups of people who supported Roman rule and then pulled their daggers and killed people. Then they ran away and hid. Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus in the New Testament, was believed by some to be a sicarius. == References == Category:1st-century people Category:Assassins Category:History of Israel Category:Jewish denominations Category:Jewish history Category:Roman Empire Category:Secret societies Category:Terrorism",
