In March 2020, he was elected as a Member of Congress for the Lima constituency. He is a founding member of the Purple Party. ==Presidency== Following the removal of Martín Vizcarra, President of Congress Manuel Merino became President of Peru after a controvertial express impeachment due to allegations of \"moral incapacity\" (a 19th century concept for mental incapacity) considered a covert parliamentary coup by many people. After a week of violent repression of the massive protestsMerino resigned as the country's leader and Sagasti was elected by his fellow Congressmen to succeed Merino as president of Congress on the 16th November. The next day Sagasti succeeded him as acting President of Peru. Sagasti is scheduled to conclude the presidential term on 28 July 2021. He would be eligible to seek election for a full term, however the Purple Party nominated Julio Guzmán as their candidate for the 2021 Peruvian general election, with Sagasti on the ticket as Second Vice President. His government coincided with the development of social conflicts such as the agrarian strike in Ica, Piura and La Libertad and Apurímac, which were resolved after the repeal of the so-called \"Chlimper Law\" that promoted investment in agriculture through meager labor benefits for workers from the field. His government has called itself a “transitional and emergency government”. ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Peru Category:Peruvian engineers Category:Peruvian academics Category:Politicians from Lima",
