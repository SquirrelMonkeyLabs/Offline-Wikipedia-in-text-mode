 "text": "The Sarisariñama rocket frog (Anomaloglossus moffetti) is a frog. Scientists found it in Venezuela and they think it might also live in Brazil. ==Body== The adult female frog can be as big as 26.9 mm from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown with dark spots. The belly and bottoms of the back legs are yellow or orange in color. There is a white or yellow stripe on each side of the body. The sides of the body are black in color with silver-white spots and sometimes brown-orange stripes. There is light brown or orange color under each eye. There are small blue spots on top of the mouth. ==Name== Scientists named this frog after photographer Mark Moffett. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in streams and near waterfalls. Scientists saw it on the Sarisariñama-tepui flatland 1108 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in Jaua-Sarisariñama National Park. ==Young== Scientists think that the tadpoles swim in streams, but they did not see them. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Climate change could kill this frog because it lives in such a small place. Because it lives high above sea level, it would be hard for the frog to move somewhere else if the place becomes too hot or too dry. Climate change could also change the plants in the frog's home too much for the frog to live there. Diseases from fungi, bacteria, and viruses can also kill this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
