 "text": "Papurana is a genus of frogs in the family Ranidae, \"true frogs.\" They live in New Guinea, some islands near New Guinea, and in northern Australia. Papurana daemeli is the only frog in Ranidae that lives in Australia. ==Taxonomy== Scientists first named Papurana as a subgenus of Rana. At times, they have said it was a subgenus of Hylarana. In 2015, Oliver and colleagues looked at Hylarana closely and said it should have only a few species in it. They said Papurana should be its own genus. ==Description== Papurana frogs have a mask mark behind their eyes, their body shape, strong wavy stripes on the backs of their thighs, and either no dorsolateral folds or very thin folds, with rough spots. The back is evenly roughened to warty and sometimes has small spikes. The frogs are medium to very large in size. Male frogs have paired, external organs for making sounds. ==Species== There are 18 species: Papurana elberti, Papurana florensis, and Papurana moluccana are only provisionally allocated to Papurana, meaning scientists want to collect more data on their bodies and genes before deciding. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania Category:Frogs of Australia",
