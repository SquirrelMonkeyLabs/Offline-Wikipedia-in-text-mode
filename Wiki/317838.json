It was formed on 18 December 1992 by the former President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, who led it until his retirement and death in 2003. It is now led by his son, Ilham Aliyev, who succeeded his father as the party leader and as President of Azerbaijan since 31 October 2003. The founder of the party, Heydar Aliyev, was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until July 1991 before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of Azerbaijan later that year. The headquarters of the party is in the capital city Baku. The party's stated ideologies are lawfulness, secularism, and Azerbaijani nationalism. It wants to build a \"social-oriented\" economy, meaning a middle path between socialism and \"laissez-faire\" capitalism (a mixed economy), and lists civil solidarity and social justice as the basis of its ideology. ==Current and historical representation in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan== * 5 November, 2000 Members of Parliament * 6 November, 2005 Members of Parliament * 7 November, 2010 Members of Parliament ==Related pages== * List of political parties in Azerbaijan * National Assembly of Azerbaijan * President of Azerbaijan * Prime Minister of Azerbaijan ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website Category:Political parties in Azerbaijan Category:Nationalist organizations in Azerbaijan Category:Conservative parties",
