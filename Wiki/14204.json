 "text": "Laurent Clerc (born Louis Laurent Marie Clerc 26 December 1788 in Isère - 18 July 1869) co-founded the first school for the deaf (people who cannot hear) in the United States. Deaf people in America respected Clerc and call him the \"Father of the Deaf\" because he founded the first school for the deaf in America in Hartford, Connecticut. Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded that school on April 15, 1817 in an old hotel. The school moved to its present location in 1821 and is now named The American School for the Deaf. The American School for the Deaf is the oldest school for the deaf in the United States. ==Other websites== *Name sign for Laurent Clerc *http://ia300102.us.archive.org/3/items/Laurent_Clerc/clerc.mpg Category:1785 births Category:1869 deaths Category:French teachers Category:American teachers Category:Deaf people Category:People from Isère",
