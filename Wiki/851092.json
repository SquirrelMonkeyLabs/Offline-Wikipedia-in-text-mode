 "text": "Marwari or Malani or Marwadi horses are a rare breed of horses from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, in northwest India. == History == The period of British colonial rule caused the Marwari's fall from dominance, and the independence of India from Britain also did the same thing fully off. The Britishers preferred other breeds, and killed off many the Marwari horses, along with the Kathiawari horses. Britishers living in India instead preferred Thoroughbreds and Polo ponies, and reduced the reputation of the Marwari horses to the point, where even the unique inward turning ears of the breed were mocked as the mark of a native horse. == Uses == The Marwari horse is a riding horse; it may also be used for shows, horse safaris, sport, ceremonial & religious purposes, and during earlier days in war. Within the Marwari horse breed was a strain known as the Natchni, believed by local people to be \"born to dance\". Decorated in silver, jewels, and bells, these horses were trained to perform complex prancing and leaping movements at many ceremonies, including weddings. Although the Natchni strain is extinct today, horses trained in those skills are still in demand in rural India. == References == Category:Horse breeds Category:Punjab (Pakistan) Category:Rajasthan",
