 "text": "A lovebird (Agapornis) is a type of parrot. There are nine species. They are a social and affectionate small parrot. Seven species are native to Africa, and the Grey-headed lovebird is native to Madagascar. Their common name comes from the parrots' strong, monogamous pair bonding and the long time the pairs spend sitting together. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grass and seeds. Black-winged lovebirds also eat insects and figs. Black- collared lovebirds have a special dietary requirement for native figs: this makes them more difficult to keep in captivity. Category:True parrots Category:Birds of Africa",
