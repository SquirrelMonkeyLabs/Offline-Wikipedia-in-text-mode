 "text": "United we stand, divided we fall is a phrase that is used in many mottos and phrases, often used to inspire unity. It is also used in its short form \"United we stand\". Aesop made up the phrase (and possibly invented it) in his stories The Four Oxen and the Lion directly and in \":The Bundle of Sticks\" indirectly. It is the state motto of Kentucky, adopted on December 30, 1792. == References == Category:State mottos of the United States Category:Aesop's Fables",
