Since no presidential candidate won a majority in the first round of voting, a runoff election took place on 24 November. Incumbent president Tabaré Vázquez was unable to run for re-election because of term limits. The Broad Front nominated former Montevideo mayor Daniel Martínez as its presidential candidate. The National Party nominated its 2014 candidate Luis Lacalle Pou, the Colorado Party nominated the economist Ernesto Talvi. During the election cycle, most opinion polls said that a run-off between Martínez and Lacalle Pou, along with the loss of the Broad Front's congressional majority. In the first round of voting, the Broad Front saw its worst results since the 1999 elections, but Martínez still received the most votes and advanced for the runoff along with Lacalle Pou. In the runoff, Lacalle Pou beat Martínez by just over 37,000 votes in a close race. ==References== Category:21st century in Uruguay Category:2019 in South America Category:2019 elections Category:Elections in Uruguay Category:October 2019 events Category:November 2019 events",
