 "text": "The Natural Bears Classification System (NBCS) is a set of symbols using letters, numbers, and other characters commonly found on modern, Western computer keyboards. It is used by gay and bisexual men who self-identify as \"bears\". These codes are used in email, Usenet, and Internet forum postings to identify the physical type and preferences of the poster. The code was developed by Bob Donahue and Jeff Stoner. The NBCS is also called the \"bear code\".Les K. Wright. The Bear Book. pp. 149ff. Psychology Press.Paul Baker. Fantabulosa: a dictionary of Polari and gay slang. p. 80. Continuum International Publishing Group. An example of the bear code is \"B4 s- m g++ w d+c t+ f+ k+ r e+(+?)\". The translation (in no particular order) is: \"Reasonably thick beard, cub tendencies, definite Daddy, (endowment) gets attention, above average fur, loves groping/pawing/touching, (Kinkiness) loves most things, (Muscle) some definition/Blue collar, spends some time outdoors, (sex) plays under special circumstances, tall, bear with a tummy\". == References == Category:LGBT Category:Bear (gay male) Category:Signalling",
