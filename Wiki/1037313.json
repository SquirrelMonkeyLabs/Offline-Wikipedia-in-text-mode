 "text": "A Hat in Time is a platform game developed by Danish game studio Gears for Breakfast. The game was developed using Unreal Engine 3. It was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which was very successful. The game was self-published for macOS and Windows in October 2017. It was published by Humble Bundle for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One two months later. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released in October 2019. The game is about Hat Kid, an alien girl trying to get back to her home by recovering lost \"Time Pieces\". The gameplay is mostly running through an open world environment by platforming, going around obstacles, and getting collectibles. It is inspired by earlier 3D platformers like Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, and Psychonauts. The game was liked by a lot of people, who said it was similar to older platformers. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2017 video games Category:3D platformers Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Indie video games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Open-world video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
