The term \"full breakfast\" in the UK is taken to mean, or include, bacon & eggs. Other terms in the UK are \"fry-up\" and \"full English\" (Scottish, Welsh, Irish...). Saut√©ed field mushrooms (Agaricus campestris) are also sometimes included.Traditional Irish Breakfast recipe from Barry's Tea The term \"full breakfast\" often appears in advertisements for hotels and boarding houses in the British Isles. There is here a reflection of the past, when men usually did manual work and needed to eat calorie-heavy meals.

The life of women raising children at home also changed after WWII as home appliances became more common.Scotney, John (November 1, 2009).
