 "text": "Liverpool University Hospitals Foundation Trust is an NHS trust which runs Aintree University Hospital, Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool University Dental Hospital and the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. It started in 2019. Royal Liverpool University Hospital was rebuilt from 2013 to 2022. It took a long time because the building firm, Carillion, went bust. It has the largest emergency department in the United Kingdom. The new building has fewer beds than the old one. There are 640 single rooms so people get more sleep and get better more quickly. The old hospital often had to close parts because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. That doesnt happen in the new hospital. In October 2022 the main corridor at Aintree Hospital was closed and turned into a ‘makeshift ward’ so that people could be brought out of the ambulances. == References == Category:NHS trusts Category:Organisations based in Merseyside",
