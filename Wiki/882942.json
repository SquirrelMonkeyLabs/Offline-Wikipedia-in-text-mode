 "text": "Musée Condé is a French museum. It is located in Chantilly within the Château de Chantilly. That is north of Paris. It was given to the Institut de France, an academic society in 1840. At that time, it was redesigned to hold museum spaces. Remaining spaces became places for people to live. This was the building style of the 18th and 19th centuries. Category:Museums in France",
