It is a reference to the May revolution in Argentina, which led to that country's later independence from Spanish rule. In Uruguay it also refers to the May revolution. On 25 May 1810, the sun came out in Buenos Aires during a public gathering. This was seen as a good omen for the future success of the independence struggle. == References == Category:National symbols of Argentina Category:National symbols of Uruguay",
