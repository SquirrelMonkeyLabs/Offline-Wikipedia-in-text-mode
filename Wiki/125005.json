 "text": "The Roman province of Dacia was in the Balkans. It included Transylvania, Banat and Oltenia in the modern Romania, and Muntenia and southern Moldova. It did not include the nearby regions of Moesia. It was a big district in Central Europe of the Roman Empire. The northern part of the border was made up of the Carpathians; the southern part of the border of Dacia was made up of the Danube River, and the western part of the border of Dacia was made up of the Tisza River. Along the borders many Roman strongpoints built. The Dacia district protected the Empire from foreign tribes of the north east side. The place where Dacia once was is now made up of Romania and Moldova, along with some parts of Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine. The capital of Dacia was Sarmizegetusa. The name of Romania came probably from the idea of the former \"Romans country\". Dacia was added to the Roman Empire in its earliest days by the Emperor Trajan. Despite its wealth, it was the first province from which Rome withdrew. From circa 168 BC to 106 AD, Dacia was an independent kingdom ruled by the Dacians, whom were native to the region. They were conquered by the Romans in 106 AD. ==Gallery== File:Porta Praetoria at castra Porolissum, Romania - view from a distance.jpg|Old entrance to castra Porolissum File:Sarmisegetusa Regia - ansamblu 1.jpg|Ruins ==Other websites== Category:Transylvania Category:History of Moldova Category:History of Bulgaria Category:History of Hungary Category:History of Romania Category:History of Serbia Category:History of Ukraine Category:Roman Empire",
