By 1996, 24,000 copies had been sold. The album helped Selena to win \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year\" at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards. Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III was the music producer and songwriter for the album. Selena wrote \"My Love\" on her own. \"Sukiyaki\" was translated from Japanese to Spanish. This was done by Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. and Pete Astudillo. The lead single, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" got to number eight on the Hot Latin Tracks chart in 1989. == Production == José Behar, president of EMI Latin, went to the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. He was looking for new musicians. After Selena sang, Behar called his boss and told him about Selena. Behar thought he found the next Gloria Estefan.Mitchell, Rick. \"Selena\". Houston Chronicle, 21 May 1995. Retrieved 1 February 2008 His boss told him that he was \"crazy\". He said this because Behar was only in Texas for a week. Selena later signed with EMI Latin later that year. She was the first artist to sign with them. Recording started in late 1988 and went on until early 1989. Selena recorded most of the songs in San Antonio, Texas at AMEN Studios. \"Sukiyaki\" and \"My Love\" were recorded in Houston, Texas at Sunrise Studios. Selena wrote \"My Love\" by herself. She wanted the song to be in the album. Her brother A.B. Quintanilla III was the music producer and main songwriter. Their father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. gave the job to A.B. He believed A.B. was good at producing music. The only songs A.B. did not write were \"Sukiyaki\", \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", and \"No Te Vayas\". The original \"Sukiyaki\" was in Japanese. Selena's lyrics were a Spanish version of an English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson. \"Sukiyaki\" had been one of Abraham's favorite songs when he was growing up. \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" was written by Mexican songwriter Alejandro Montealegre. \"No Te Vayas\" was written by Reinaldo Ornelas. A.B. wanted \"No Te Vayas\" on the album because of its reggae sounds. He thought it would make the album \"exotic\" (different) from other Spanish-language albums. He believed this because of the different music genres they had produced. == Release == Selena was released on October 17, 1989 by EMI Latin. In its first week on the US Regional Mexican Albums chart (December 2, 1989), it was at number 17. It got to its highest place on the chart, number 7, on March 24, 1990.
