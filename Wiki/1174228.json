 "text": "Hudson's Bay is a Canadian chain of department stores. They have headquarters in Brampton, Ontario. They have 83 store locations, 2 outlet stores, and 1 warehouse. From 1965 until October 2012, the stores were known as The Bay and are still colloquially known by the name. It is a division of the Hudson's Bay Company, one of the oldest companies in North America and one of the oldest and still operating companies in the world. In 1881, the Hudson's Bay Company opened their first department store in Winnipeg, Manitoba, selling groceries and hardware supplies. They fully changed from fur trading to full department stores in 1913. November 1960 saw Hudson's Bay purchase the Montreal-based Morgan's chain. In 1965, the Hudson's Bay department store decided to change their name to The Bay and changed their logo to a yellow B in an attempt to modernize their stores. On March 6, 2013, the company decided to change back to their original name of Hudson's Bay and changed their logo to their coat of arms. In March 2023, Hudson's Bay Company officially revived the defunct Zellers brand and included physical spaces for it in select Hudson's Bay department stores. On March 7, 2025, Hudson's Bay filed for creditor protection and announced that they were going to restructure the business because of lower foot traffic in store and the Canadaâ€“United States trade war. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1670 establishments Category:Companies based in Toronto Category:Department stores of Canada",
