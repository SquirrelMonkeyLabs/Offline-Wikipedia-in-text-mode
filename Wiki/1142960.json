 "text": "Adam Dollard des Ormeaux (1635-1660) is a notable figure in New France's history (now Quebec). He arrived in the colony in 1658 and became the garrison commander of Ville-Marie (Montreal). In 1660, he led a small group on an expedition up the Ottawa River to confront the Iroquois. They set up camp at an abandoned fort near Long Sault, where they were later surrounded by a much larger Iroquois force. Dollard and his men fought bravely and were ultimately killed in the Battle of Long Sault between May 9 and May 12, 1660. Many historians believe Dollard aimed to ambush the Iroquois to protect Ville-Marie from their attack, earning him a reputation as a hero in New France. Dollard was born in France and moved to Montreal at 24, where he gained a good reputation and military experience. He was supported by the governor of Montreal for his expedition, despite having little experience in Indigenous warfare. His group faced about 700 Iroquois and, after several days of siege, they were all killed or captured. Some believe that the battle weakened the Iroquois enough to cancel their planned attack on Montreal. The reasons behind Dollard's actions are debated. While tradition suggests he sought to defend Ville-Marie, some historians speculate he may have been motivated by personal debts. The exact location of the battle is also disputed, with some claiming it occurred in Quebec and others in Ontario. Regardless, Dollard is remembered for his sacrifice and bravery Category:1635 births Category:1660 deaths Category:17th-century French people Category:People of New France Category:People from Quebec",
