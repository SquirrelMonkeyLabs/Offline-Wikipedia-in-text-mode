 "text": "A strong tornado struck Vicksburg, Mississippi and areas nearby during the evening of December 5, 1953. The storm ran through the city at right after 5:30 pm that Saturday evening. The event killed 38 people. It was then the fourth deadliest tornado in the history of the state. It also injured almost 270. Damage totaled $25 million at the time. The tornado that went through Vicksburg was estimated officially as an F5. That rating, however, is questionable. That's because the property destroyed was frail and weak. Some people call this tornado likely an F4 instead of an F5. ==References== Category:Tornadoes in the United States Category:Natural disasters in the United States Category:1950s in weather Category:20th century in Mississippi Vicksburg tornado",
