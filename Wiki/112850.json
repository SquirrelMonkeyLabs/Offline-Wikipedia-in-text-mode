It tells the story of the love between Yasemin and Ahmet, two young people from opposing families. It also tells the relationship between their relatives and friends in the political era starting at the end of the 1950s in Turkey. Real historical events are shown, beginning with Prime Minister Adnan Menderes' 1959 plane crash survival. This is followed by the 1960 military coup, the trial on Yassıada and the executions. These important events divided Turkish society afterwards. Hatırla Sevgili became one of the most popular and most controversial TV series in Turkey. Some people did not like it because of the superficial coverage of some historical events.
