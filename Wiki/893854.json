 "text": "Onychonycteris is an extinct genus of bat, which lived during the Eocene period, 52.5 million years ago, in the area that is now Wyoming. One species has been described, Onychonycteris finneyi. Using this species, it could be shown that these primitive bats first developed the ability to fly, before they had echolocation.Nancy B.
