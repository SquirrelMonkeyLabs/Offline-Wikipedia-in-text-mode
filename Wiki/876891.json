 "text": "The spotted leaf frog (Phasmahyla guttata) is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives in the mountains not far from the ocean. People have seen it between 50 and 1200 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over streams. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the stream below. Scientists do not believe this frog is in danger of dying out because the place where it lives is not in danger even though, in the past, humans cut down trees to make towns, farms, and places for cows to eat grass. Scientists think this frog can make useful chemicals in its skin. But they do not think anyone catches this frog to take the chemicals. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
