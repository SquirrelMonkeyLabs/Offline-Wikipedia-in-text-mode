 "text": "Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is the principal storage form of glucose in animal cells. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides. Only the glycogen stored in the liver can be made accessible to other organs. ==Related pages== * Metabolism == Other websites == * Glycogen detection using Periodic Acid Schiff Staining Category:Carbohydrates Category:Organic compounds",
