 "text": "The ECHL (formerly East Coast Hockey League) is a professional ice hockey league based in the United States and is considered a lower tier than the American Hockey League (AHL). == Overview == The ECHL and the American Hockey League are the only ice hockey leagues that receive recognition by the collective bargaining agreement between the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association which means that any player that is signed to an entry-level NHL contract and is designated for assignment must report to a club either in the AHL or the ECHL. The major championship in the ECHL that the two winning team of their conferences play for is the Kelly Cup. There are currently 29 teams in the ECHL. == Teams in the ECHL == Division Team City Arena Founded Joined Head Coach NHL Affiliate AHL Affiliate Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference North Adirondack Thunder Glens Falls, New York Cool Insuring Arena 1990* 1990* Pete MacArthur New Jersey Devils Utica Comets North Maine Mariners Portland, Maine Cross Insurance Arena 1989* 2003 Terrence Wallin Boston Bruins Providence Bruins North Norfolk Admirals Norfolk, Virginia Norfolk Scope 1995* 2003 Jeff Carr Winnipeg Jets (official) Carolina Hurricanes (working agreement) Manitoba Moose North Reading Royals Reading, Pennsylvania Santander Arena 1991* 1991* James Henry Philadelphia Flyers Lehigh Valley Phantoms North Trois-Rivières Lions Trois-Rivières, Quebec Colisée Vidéotron 2021 2021 Ron Choules Montreal Canadiens Laval Rocket North Wheeling Nailers Wheeling, West Virginia WesBanco Arena 1981* 1988 Derek Army Pittsburgh Penguins Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins North Worcester Railers Worcester, Massachusetts DCU Center 2017 David Cunniff New York Islanders Bridgeport Islanders South Atlanta Gladiators Duluth, Georgia Gas South Arena 1995* 1995* Jeff Pyle Nashville Predators Milwaukee Admirals South Florida Everblades Estero, Florida Hertz Arena 1998 1998 Brad Ralph Florida Panthers Charlotte Checkers South Greenville Swamp Rabbits Greenville, South Carolina Bon Secours Wellness Arena 1987* 1988 Andrew Lord Los Angeles Kings Ontario Reign South Jacksonville Icemen Jacksonville, Florida VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena 1992* 2012 Nick Luukko Buffalo Sabres Rochester Americans South Orlando Solar Bears Orlando, Florida Kia Center 2012 2012 Matt Carkner Tampa Bay Lightning Syracuse Crunch South Savannah Ghost Pirates Savannah, Georgia Enmarket Arena 2022 2022 Rick Bennett Vegas Golden Knights Henderson Silver Knights South South Carolina Stingrays North Charleston, South Carolina North Charleston Coliseum 1993 1993 Ryan Blair Washington Capitals Hershey Bears Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Central Bloomington Bison Bloomington, Illinois Grossinger Motors Arena 2024 Phillip Barski New York Rangers, (Official Affiliate) Carolina Hurricanes, (working agreement) Hartford Wolf Pack Central Cincinnati Cyclones Cincinnati, Ohio Heritage Bank Center 1995* 1995* Jason Payne New York Rangers Hartford Wolf Pack Central Fort Wayne Komets Fort Wayne, Indiana Allen County War Memorial Coliseum 1985* 2012 Jesse Kallechy Edmonton Oilers Bakersfield Condors Central Indy Fuel Indianapolis, Indiana Indiana Farmers Coliseum 2014 2014 Duncan Dalmao Chicago Blackhawks Rockford IceHogs Central Iowa Heartlanders Coralville, Iowa Xtream Arena 2021 2021 Derek Damon Minnesota Wild Iowa Wild Central Kalamazoo Wings Kalamazoo, Michigan Wings Event Center 1999* 2009 Joel Martin Vancouver Canucks Abbotsford Canucks Central Toledo Walleye Toledo, Ohio Huntington Center 1991 1991 Dan Watson Detroit Red Wings Grand Rapids Griffins Mountain Allen Americans Allen, Texas Credit Union of Texas Event Center 2009 2014 Chad Costello Ottawa Senators Belleville Senators Mountain Idaho Steelheads Boise, Idaho Idaho Central Arena 1997 2003 Everett Sheen Dallas Stars Texas Stars Mountain Kansas City Mavericks Independence, Missouri Cable Dahmer Arena 2009 2014 Tad O'Had Seattle Kraken Coachella Valley Firebirds Mountain Rapid City Rush Rapid City, South Dakota The Monument 2008 2014 Scott Burt Calgary Flames Calgary Wranglers Mountain Tahoe Knight Monsters Stateline, Nevada Tahoe Blue Event Center 2024 Alex Loh Vegas Golden Knights Henderson Silver Knights Mountain Tulsa Oilers Tulsa, Oklahoma BOK Center 1992 2014 Rob Murray Anaheim Ducks San Diego Gulls Mountain Utah Grizzlies West Valley City, Utah Maverik Center 1981* 1988 Ryan Kinasewich Colorado Avalanche Colorado Eagles Mountain Wichita Thunder Wichita, Kansas Intrust Bank Arena 1992 2014 Bruce Ramsay San Jose Sharks San Jose Barracuda ; Notes # A star (*) denotes a franchise move.
