Trainor collaborated with producers such as Federico Vindver, Gian Stone, Grant Boutin, and Jason Evigan and featured artists included T-Pain, Lawrence, and Niecy Nash. The album has a doo-wop and bubblegum pop sound with club beats and influences of dance-pop and R&B.; Its message centers on self-empowerment, women's empowerment, and positive self-talk, drawing inspiration from Trainor's family, motherhood, and her experiences in the music industry. Trainor promoted Timeless with public appearances and televised performances on programs such as Today and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. After its release, she embarked on her first concert tour in over seven years, The Timeless Tour (2024). The album was supported by three singles, \"Been Like This\", a collaboration with T-Pain, \"To the Moon\", and \"Whoops\".
