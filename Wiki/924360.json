 "text": "The issue of Human rights in Djibouti is a matter of concern for several human rights organizations. Djibouti is a small African country. It is on the Horn of Africa, The US State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2019 said there were unlawful or arbitrary killings by government agents; arbitrary detention by government agents; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; unjustified arrests or prosecutions of journalists; criminal libel; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; significant acts of corruption; and violence against women and girls with inadequate government action for prosecution and accountability, including female genital mutilation/cutting. It states also that the government seldom takes steps to identify and punish officials who committed abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in the government. ==Minority and women's rights== Female genital mutilation is common. Equality, however, has been making strides; over 50% of judges are now women. According to American advocacy group Freedom House, minority groups such as Yemenis and Afars are not being treated fairly. ==References== Djibouti Category:Djibouti",
