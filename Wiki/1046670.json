It was made available in 2022 under the license Licence Amicale, that lets people share the font files with friends and colleagues. Vercetti is a computer font distributed for free (as freeware), designed by Greek graphic designer Filippos Fragkogiannis in collaboration with type designer Richard Mandona. Vercetti Regular was inspired by humanistic and geometric design elements. When creating Vercetti, the designers used principles from an earlier open- source font called MgOpen Moderna. The font has 326 glyphs, including numbers, symbols, punctuation marks, and accents. This means it can be used for all the languages in Europe that use the Latin alphabet. Vercetti is optimised for use in web design.
