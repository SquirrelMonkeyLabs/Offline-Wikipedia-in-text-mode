 "text": "In mathematics, the power set of a set S, written as P(S) or \\mathcal{P}(S), is the set of all subsets of S. In terms of cardinality, a power set is larger than the set it originates from. If S is a finite set with n elements, then P(S) would have 2^n elements. ==Examples== * The power set of \\\\{2, 5\\\\} is \\\\{\\\\{\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}, \\\\{5\\\\}, \\\\{2, 5\\\\}\\\\}. * The power set of \\\\{3, 4, 10\\\\} is \\\\{\\\\{\\\\}, \\\\{3\\\\}, \\\\{4\\\\}, \\\\{10\\\\}, \\\\{3, 4\\\\}, \\\\{3, 10\\\\}, \\\\{4, 10\\\\}, \\\\{3, 4, 10\\\\}\\\\}. == Related pages == * Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory, which includes an axiom on power set == References == Category:Set theory Category:Algebra",
