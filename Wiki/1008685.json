 "text": "The Gwinnett Stripers are a Minor League Baseball team from Gwinnett County, Georgia, near Lawrenceville, in suburban Atlanta. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Stripers are partnered with the Atlanta Braves, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Braves. The team is named \"Stripers\" for the striped bass, because fishing is popular in the region. They used to be called the Gwinnett Braves after their MLB partner from 2009 to 2017. They changed their name to Stripers in 2018. The Stripers play at a stadium called Coolray Field, which opened in 2009. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball- Reference Category:2000s establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Atlanta Braves Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Sports in Georgia (U.S. state)",
