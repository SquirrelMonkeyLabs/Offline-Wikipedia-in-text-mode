 "text": "Álvaro Antonio Gestido Pose (17 May 1907 -- 18 January 1957) was a Uruguayan footballer who played as a midfielder for Uruguay national team. Alvaro Gestido was an attacking left half-back, relentless in marking the opposing wing. His duel with the Argentinian right wing Carlos Peucelle in the 1930 Montevideo World Cup final was memorable. He was only 23 when he helped Uruguay win the World Cup and was only 21 when he won a gold medal at Amsterdam 1928. Gestido earned 26 caps with the national team. He is widely regarded as one of the finest half-backs in world football. A born leader, both on and off the pitch, Gestido spent his entire career with Peñarol, from 1928 to 1941, winning seven Uruguayan titles. Internationally he won the Copa Río de la Plata in 1928, consisting of a match between the champion clubs of Uruguay and Argentina. His older brother, Oscar Diego Gestido Pose, became President of Uruguay from March to December 1967. ==Club career== Gestido, who was called \"El Teniente\" (the lieutenant) by the fans, entered the Escuela Militar military school from 1923 and obtained the rank of colonel there. He had already started playing football as a 15-year-old boy in 1922 at a local club in the neighborhood (or Cuarta) of Peñarol. After graduating from military school, he joined Club Atlético Peñarol in 1926, where he would play throughout his career. With the club he won the Uruguayan league championship 7 times (in 1928, 1929, 1932, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938). He also won the Copa Aldao (match between the champions of Uruguay and Argentina) in 1928 and the Torneo Competencia (Uruguay national cup) in 1936. In total, Gestido made 445 appearances for the club, and on 28 September 1941, he announced his football retirement during a match to mark Peñarol's 50th anniversary against Argentine club River Plate. In 1944 he made a brief comeback, coming on as a substitute twice in two league games. Later that year, on 22 September 1944, he was made an honorary member by the club. ==International career== Between 14 July 1927 and 15 August 1940, Gestido played 26 international matches for the Uruguay national team. He failed to score a goal in those games. At the 1928 Summer Olympics football tournament, he won the gold medal with his team and was considered by many to be the Celeste's best player. The following year, he competed with his country in Buenos Aires at the 1929 Campeonato Sudamericano (now the Copa América), where the team finished third. A year later, the first-ever football World Cup was organized in his own country. Gestido was a starting player in all matches including the final win against Argentina, with which Uruguay won its first of two world titles. Together with José Andrade and Lorenzo Fernández, he formed the so-called \"costilla metálica\" (iron curtain) as a link between the defense and attack. ==Death== Gestido died in 1957 at the age of 49 in Santa Clara del Olimar, a small city in eastern Uruguay, of a heart attack. ==Honours== * Peñarol ** Uruguayan Primera División: 1928, 1929, 1932 & 1935\\. ** \"La Tribuna Popular\" Trophy: 1932 ** José Piendibene Cup: 1929 ** Mirurgia Cup: 1928 ** Ricardo Pittaluga Cup: 1928 ** Copa Aldao: 1928 ===International=== * Uruguay ** South American Championship: 1929 Third place ** FIFA World Cup: 1930 Winner ** 1928 Summer Olympics: 1928 Gold Medal ** Copa Newton: 1929 & 1930 Winner ** Copa Lipton: 1927 & 1929 Winner ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1930 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA World Cup–winning players Category:1957 deaths Category:Footballers from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan men's footballers Category:Uruguayan Primera División players Category:Peñarol players",
