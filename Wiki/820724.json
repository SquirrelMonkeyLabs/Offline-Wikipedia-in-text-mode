 "text": "The burrowing tree frog, lowland burrowing tree frog, northern casque-headed frog, or northern casquehead frog (Smilisca fodiens) is a frog that lives in northern Mexico and southern Arizona. The adult frog is 54 to 63 mm long from nose to rear end. The male frogs and female frogs are about the same size. Its hind legs are short and strong. It has more bone in its head than most frogs do. Its toes have discs for climbing. Its front toes are not webbed. It is gray-brown, green-prown, or pink-brown in color. Scientists say this frog is related to Smilisca dentata. This frog burrows into the ground in grasslands or scrub forests. It can also form a cocoon to stop water from leaving its body. It makes the cocoon by shedding its skin. These frogs lay eggs after it rains, in bodies of water than dry up. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
