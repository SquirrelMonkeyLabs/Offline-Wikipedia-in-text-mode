 "text": "The Mickey Mouse Club, otherwise referred to as MMC for short, was an American variety television series that began in 1955, ran intermittently, and left the air in 1996. It was directed by Walt Disney Productions. Over the years, the series featured many stellar teenage performers including Annette Funicello, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake. The original series ran newsreels, cartoons, talent segments, and Disney produced serials such as The Hardy Boys with Tommy Kirk and Tim Considine. Mickey Mouse Club was hosted by Jimmie Dodd, a songwriter and the Head Mouseketeer. He provided leadership both on and off screen. In addition to his other contributions, he often provided short segments encouraging young viewers to make the right moral choices. These little sermons became known as \"Doddisms\".Cotter, Jim.
