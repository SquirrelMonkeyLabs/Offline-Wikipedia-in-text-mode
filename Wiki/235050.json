 "text": "The 1984 United States presidential election happened on November 6, 1984. Ronald Reagan, the incumbent president and Republican candidate, won the election. He defeated Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate, who was the vice president of Jimmy Carter. During the debates, Mondale criticized Ronald Reagan's idea (called Strategic Defense Initiative) to build a missile defense system and also criticized him for making the government borrow too much money. The bad economy of 1982 ended, and the economy recovered very quickly. During the election, the economy was the greatest it had been in many years. Ronald Reagan called it \"Morning In America\". Ronald Reagan won the election by a huge landslide (winning 49 out of 50 states). This election received the highest electoral votes towards any presidential nominee in American history. It is the lowest electoral vote for a Democratic nominee and the highest for a Republican to date. ==Candidates== ===Republican Party=== * Ronald Reagan, President of the United States from California * Harold Stassen, former governor of Minnesota * Ben Fernandez, former Special Ambassador to Paraguay from California ====Candidates gallery==== File:Ronald Reagan 1985 presidential portrait 3x4.jpg|President Ronald Reagan File:Harold Stassen.jpg|Former Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota ===Democratic Party=== *Walter Mondale, former U.S. vice president and former U.S. senator from Minnesota *Gary Hart, U.S. senator from Colorado *Jesse Jackson, reverend and civil rights activist from Illinois *John Glenn, U.S. senator from Ohio *George McGovern, former U.S. senator and 1972 Democratic nominee from South Dakota *Reubin Askew, former Governor of Florida *Joe Biden, U.S. senator from Delaware *Alan Cranston, U.S. senator from California *Ernest Hollings, U.S. senator from South Carolina ====Candidates gallery==== File:U.S Vice- President Walter Mondale.jpg|Former Vice President Walter Mondale from Minnesota File:GaryHart.jpg|Senator Gary Hart from Colorado File:JesseJackson.png|Reverend Jesse Jackson from Illinois File:John Glenn Low Res.jpg|Senator John Glenn from Ohio File:GeorgeStanleyMcGovern.png|Former Senator George McGovern from South Dakota File:AlanCranston.jpg|Senator Alan Cranston from California File:FritzHollings.jpg|Senator Ernest Hollings from South Carolina File:ReubinAskew.JPG|Former Governor Reubin Askew of Florida File:Joebiden2.png|Senator Joe Biden from Delaware ==References== Category:1984 in the United States Category:1984 elections Category:Ronald Reagan 1984",
