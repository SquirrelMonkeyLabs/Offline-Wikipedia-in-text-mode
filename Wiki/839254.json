His mother drugged him and jumped in the Atlantic Ocean where they both drowned. An investigation after the murder showed that the social services could have prevented the deaths. ==Perpetrator== Shirley Jane Turner (28 January 1961 – 18 August 2003) was a Canadian-American daughter of a U.S. serviceman and local woman from St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador. Turner was raised with three siblings in Wichita, Kansas, but moved to Newfoundland with her mother after her parents separated.
