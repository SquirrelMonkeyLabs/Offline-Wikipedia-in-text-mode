 "text": "Valcour Bay is a strait between the New York mainland and Valcour Island. It is four miles south from Plattsburgh, New York. The bay was where the Battle of Valcour Island had happened during the American Revolutionary War. On October 11, 1776, the presence of an American fleet on the west shore of Lake Champlain, at Valcour Bay, hampered the British and allowed an American victory at Saratoga a year later, a turning point in the Revolutionary War. In 1961 Valcour Bay was declared a National Historic Landmark. and ==References== Category:American Revolutionary War Category:Straits of North America Category:Geography of New York (state)",
