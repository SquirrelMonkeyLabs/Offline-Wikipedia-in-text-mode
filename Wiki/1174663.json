 "text": "The National Reorganization Process (Spanish: Proceso de Reorganización Nacional) was the name used by the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. This period was marked by severe human rights abuses, economic problems, and social unrest. == Background == In the 1970s, Argentina was facing many challenges. There was political instability, economic crisis, and violence between different groups, including left-wing guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary forces. On March 24, 1976, the military took control of the government in a coup d'état. They called their rule the \"National Reorganization Process\" and claimed they wanted to restore order and stability. == The military government == The military government was led by a series of generals, including Jorge Rafael Videla, Roberto Eduardo Viola, and Leopoldo Galtieri. They dissolved the Argentine Congress, banned political parties, and took control of the media. The military claimed they were fighting against \"subversion\" and \"communism,\" but they also targeted anyone who opposed them, including students, workers, and activists. == The Dirty War == One of the darkest parts of this period was the Dirty War (Spanish: Guerra Sucia). The military government kidnapped, tortured, and killed thousands of people who they saw as threats. These victims are known as the \"desaparecidos\" (the disappeared) because many were never seen again. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during this time. The military also targeted pregnant women, taking their babies and giving them to families connected to the regime. Groups like the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo have worked for decades to find these children and bring justice to the victims. == Economic problems == The military government also made big changes to the economy. They followed neoliberal policies, which included cutting government spending, reducing workers' rights, and opening the economy to foreign businesses. At first, the economy seemed to improve, but by the early 1980s, Argentina faced a severe economic crisis. Inflation soared, and many people lost their jobs. == The Falklands War == In 1982, the military government tried to distract people from the country’s problems by starting a war with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas). The Falklands War lasted about two months and ended in a defeat for Argentina. This loss further weakened the military government and increased public anger. == End of the dictatorship == By 1983, the military government had lost all support. The economy was in ruins, and people were demanding change. The military agreed to hold democratic elections, and in December 1983, Raúl Alfonsín was elected president. This marked the end of the National Reorganization Process and the return of democracy to Argentina. == Aftermath == After the dictatorship ended, efforts were made to bring those responsible for human rights abuses to justice. Trials were held, and some military leaders, including Videla, were sentenced to prison. However, many people felt that not enough was done to address the crimes of the dictatorship. The National Reorganization Process left a deep scar on Argentina. It is remembered as a time of fear, violence, and suffering, but also as a time when many people fought for justice and human rights. == References == Category:History of Argentina Category:1976 establishments in Argentina Category:1970s in Argentina Category:1983 disestablishments in Argentina Category:1980s in Argentina Category:Anti-Peronism Category:Anti-communism in Argentina Category:Counterterrorism in Argentina Category:Military dictatorships Category:Operation Condor Category:States and territories established in 1976 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1983 Category:Totalitarian states",
