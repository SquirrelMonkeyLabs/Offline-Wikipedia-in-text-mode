 "text": "This article serves as a list of every Total Drama character from Season 1 to the reboot. == Hosts == * Chris McLean (voiced by Christian Potenza and later Terry McGurrin in season 6 above) is a Scottish Canadian host of the main series. He is a narcissist, and selfish; making him universally hated by the contestants. After Season 4, he was arrested for turning Camp Wawanakwa into a toxic wasteland; though he was bailed out by Chef to host Season 5.1. Chris doesn't host in Ridonculous Race, although makes an appearance in \"A Million Ways to Lose a Million Dollars\", as he was taking a long two year break from the reboot. * Chef Hatchet (voiced by Cl√© Bennett and later Deven Mack in Total DramaRama and season 6 above) is an African-Canadian chef for the series, occasionally as the co-host of the series. Sometimes, when Chris is absent, he hosts the game. He is a tough, and a military tough sidekick of Chris. Although, he is shown to actually care for the contestants unlike Chris. Chef in the Total DramaRama universe, is the only teacher in the Daycare. * Don (voiced by Terry McGurrin) is the main host of Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race. Don cares about the safety of the contestants; even if he puts them through dangerous challenges. He has a slight ego; not like Chris'. == Contestants == === Debuted in Total Drama Island === * Beth (voiced by Sarah Gadon) is a contestant of Total Drama Island and Total Drama Action. She wears braces (which is removed from Action above), and is mostly nice girl, and does anything for any attention. Overtime, she learns how to stand up for herself and stay strong until the end; as seen in Island and Action. Her best friend is Lindsay.
