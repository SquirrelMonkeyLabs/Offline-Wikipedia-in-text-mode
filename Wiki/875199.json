 "text": "Soyuz MS-19 was a Soyuz spaceflight which launched on 5 October 2021. It was the 147th flight of a crewed Soyuz spacecraft. The crew members were Russian commander Anton Shkaplerov, Russian film director Klim Shipenko, and Russian actress Yulia Peresild. Shipenko and Peresild spent about twelve days on the International Space Station before returning to Earth aboard Soyuz MS-18. They filmed a movie in space, Vyzov (). Without an American astronaut, this launch was the first time in more than 21 years (since Soyuz TM-30 in 2000) that a Soyuz crew only included Russian cosmonauts and travelers. It was the first time in years that the ship had to be upgraded to be piloted by a single person at launch. This is also the first mission to the ISS with an entirely Russian crew. It landed on March 30, 2022 in The Kazakh Steppe in Kazakhstan. ==References== Category:October 2021 events Category:2020s in spaceflight",
