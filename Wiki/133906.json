 "text": "Campylobacter is a genus of bacteria.Vandamme, Peter et al 2006. Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology: volume 2: The Proteobacteria (Part C). 2nd ed, Springer, pp. 1147â€“1160. It is found in the intestines of many types of animal. Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhea and food poisoning. It is spiral shaped, and moves by using its flagella. Campylobacteriosis is a gastrointestinal tract infection caused by Campylobacter. It causes inflammation, sometimes bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever, and pain. Campylobacteriosis is more common during the summer months. It also appears to be more common in males than females. It is caused by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Eating raw meat or undercooked poultry, and raw dairy products are common causes. In January 2013, the UK's Food Standards Agency warned that two-thirds of all raw chicken bought from UK shops was contaminated with Campylobacter. It affects about half a million people annually and kills about 100. == References == Category:Gram-negative bacteria Category:Diseases caused by bacteria",
