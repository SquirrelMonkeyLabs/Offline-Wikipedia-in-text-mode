 "text": "William Blake (28 November 1757 - 12 August 1827) was an English poet, visionary, painter, and printmaker. He was born and died in London. During his lifetime he was not very well known. Today Blake's work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts. Blake's first collection of poems, Poetical Sketches, was printed around 1783. His most famous poem \"And did those feet in ancient time\" was, over 100 years later, put to music by Hubert Parry. The hymn is called \"Jerusalem\". Blake was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest Britons organised by the BBC in 2002. ==Books about Blake== ==References== == Other websites == * Recent Discovery of the Location of William Blake's Grave. * The William Blake Archive, a multi-media archive, sponsored by the Library of Congress * * Blake250: 2007 London festival celebrating 250 years of William Blake's influence * Paintings of William Blake * William Blake Society * Friends of William Blake * Blake Society * Making facsimiles of Blake's prints * William Blake at the British Library Profiles * Profile at the Academy of American Poets * Profile at the Poetry Foundation * William Blake profile, video on BBC Poetry Season and BBC etching gallery * Tate William Blake learning resource * Profile at Jacob Boehme Online Archives * The William Blake Archive â€“ A Comprehensive Academic Archive of Blake's works with scans from multiple collections * Single Institution Holdings: ** The G.E.
