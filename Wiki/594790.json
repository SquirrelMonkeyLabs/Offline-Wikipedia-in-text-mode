The title is a prefix to her given name or personal name, and is used by females usually of noble or royal background. It may also be used to address older women out of respect. Any woman believed to be descended from Muhammad has the title of Lalla. Likewise, any man who is believed to be descended from Muhammad has the title of Sidi or Moulay (Moulay being a higher honorific). ==References== Category:Titles",
