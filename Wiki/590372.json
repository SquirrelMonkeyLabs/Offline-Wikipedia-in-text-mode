 "text": "Local elections in Latvia were held on 3 June 2017. All 119 municipal councils of the country took part in the elections. == Election system == A number of deputies in the council depends on the amount of population in the territory: the bigger the population in the territory is, the more deputies work in the council. The number of deputies can be 9, 13, 15, 17 or 19. The only exclusion is the council of Riga, which is the capital of Latvia. Riga is by far bigger than any other city of Latvia, so its municipal council consists of 60 deputies. Citizens of Latvia and other countries of the European Union who are over 18 years old have the right to vote in the local elections. In order to vote citizens of other EU countries have to register in the Population Register of Latvia at least 90 days before the election date. Voters take part in the local elections in the territory where they live or where they have real estate. Registration of voters is automatic. People are automatically registered for the local elections on a certain polling station according to the place where they live. However, no later than 18 days before the elections people can change their polling station to any other polling station in the territories where they live or have real estate. On the election day polling stations work from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Three days prior to the election date early voting is possible: polling stations are usually opened for several hours during these days. == Campaign == 599 lists of candidates were registered to participate in the local elections throughout the country. The number of candidates willing to become deputies was 8945. 465 lists were nominated by political parties individually, 31 lists by coalitions of political parties and 103 lists by unions of voters.Kopsavilkums par partiju, partiju apvienību un vēlētāju apvienību deputātu kandidātu sarakstiem 77.46% of all candidates were ethnic Latvians, 3.90% ethnic Russians, 0.48% ethnic Poles, 1.37% all others. 16.99% of candidates refused to state their ethnic identity.2017\\. gada 3. jūnija pašvaldību vēlēšanas 11.6% of all voters, which equals 167 thousand people, took part in the early voting from 31 May to 2 June.2017\\. gada 3. jūnija pašvaldību vēlēšanas The total turnout of the local elections was 50.41% or 727839 people.2017\\. gada 3. jūnija pašvaldību vēlēšanas == Results == The following map shows the results of the local elections in different territories of Latvia.
