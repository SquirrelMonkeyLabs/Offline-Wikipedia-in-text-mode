 "text": "Phasmahyla timbo is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in one place: Serra do Timb√≥. People have seen it between 800 and 900 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because the farmers keep trees growing to make shade for cacao cabrucas plants. It lives in forests. The female frog lays eggs on leaves that grow over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water below. This frog can make useful chemicals in its skin, but scientists do not think anyone is catching the frog to get them. Some scientists say this is the same frog as Phasmahyla spectabilis. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
