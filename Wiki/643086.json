He was the first Italian American to be elected as a senator. Pastore was best known taking part in a 1969 hearing involving a $20 million grant for the funding of PBS. President Richard Nixon had wanted to cut the proposed funding to $10 million due to the demands of the Vietnam War. Fred Rogers, host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, appeared before the committee to argue for the full $20 million. After hearing Rogers's testimony Pastore restored the funding.Fred Rogers Center: Video of Mr. Rogers' testimony.
