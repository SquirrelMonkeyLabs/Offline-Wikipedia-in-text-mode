 "text": "The Fatah–Hamas conflict is an ongoing inter-Palestinian militant conflict between Fatah, based in the West Bank, and Hamas, based in the Gaza Strip. The conflict began after the Second Intifada because Fatah disputed Hamas winning 2006 elections in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). It grew further when Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip by military force in 2007 during the Battle of Gaza. The two groups have been trying to reconcile in recent years and have since found themselves somewhat on the same side in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. ==Notes== == References == == Related pages == * Gaza–Israel conflict * Israel–Palestine conflict * Palestinian political violence Category:History of Palestine Category:Fatah Category:Hamas Category:Al-Aqsa Category:Conflicts in the Levant Category:Gaza Strip Category:West Bank Category:Algeria",
