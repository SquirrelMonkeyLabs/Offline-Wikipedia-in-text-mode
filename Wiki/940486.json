 "text": "Theodore Bua, or Theodore Bouas (Greek: Θεόδωρος Μπούας), was a 15th-century Greek military leader from Albania who served as a captain of the stradioti of the Republic of Venice.. ==Biography== When the Ottomans and the Venetians made peace in 1479 (Treaty of Constantinople), Theodore Bouas left the Venetian army and joined the revolt of Krokodeilos Kladas in the Peloponnese (called Morea). The Venetian official Bartolomeo Minio recorded an event where the Venetian commander of Nafplio sent a group of stratioti against Bouas and Mexa Busichi but the soldiers did not attack because they were compatriots.; see also Bartolomeo Minio's Dispacci al Senato e ad Altri. The rebellion failed after both leaders ended their alliance. Afterwards, Bouas returned to Venetian territory but was jailed in Monemvasia. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * Category:15th-century people Category:Greek people",
