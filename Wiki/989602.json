 "text": "On 14 January 2023, a drive-by mass shooting was committed in Euston Road, Central London, England. The attacker used a shotgun outside of St Aloysius Roman Catholic church, as a memorial service was ending. Six people were injured, four women (aged 21, 41, 48 and 54) and two girls (aged 7 and 12). The memorial service was for Fresia Calderon and her daughter Sara Sanchez who died separately from natural causes in November 2022. No-one was killed, but the 7-year-old girl has been reported to have had a life-threatening injury from the event. On 15 January, shortly before 4pm, the Metropolitan Police arrested a 22-year-old man in Barnet on suspicion of attempted murder. On 15 March, two men were charged in connection with the shooting. == Reactions == Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer (the MP for the area) called for tighter restrictions on who can own pump-action shotguns. == References == Category:2023 crimes in Europe Category:2023 in England Category:2023 mass shootings Category:2020s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2020s mass shootings in Europe Category:21st century in London Category:Crime in London Category:January 2023 events",
