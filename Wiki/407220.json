 "text": "Dido Queen of Carthage is a play by Christopher Marlowe. It is a tragedy. The date of the play is uncertain. It is probably Marlowe's first play, and possibly written while he was a student at Cambridge University. The source material was Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Heroides. Unlike his sources however, Marlowe emphasizes not the character of Aeneas but the character of Dido. ==References== * Cheney, Patrick (Ed.) 2004. The Cambridge Companion to Christopher Marlowe.
