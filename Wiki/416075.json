 "text": "Stormtroopers are highly trained human soldiers In the Star Wars universe. They are the main military forces for the Galactic Empire. During the original Star Wars movie series (Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Rerturn of the Jedi) they worked for Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. Stormtroopers wear white armor and helmets. They are armed with blaster guns. Stormtroopers replaced the clone troopers which were first seen in Attack of the Clones. Clone troopers where clones of the bounty hunter, Jango Fett. These clones were used in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith as well as the animated movie and television series The Clone Wars. By the time of the original series, the clone had been replaced by normal humans. After the deaths of Sidious and Vader in Return of the Jedi, stormtroopers continued to serve the remaining leaders of the Galactic Empire. They can be seen in the third Star Wars trilogy, The Skywalker Saga (The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker). In these movies, the stormtroopers are seen working for the First Order. This group is the main remaining part of the Empire. In addition to the basic stormtrooper, there are many different types of stormtroop. Each type is either trained for a specific job or the are equipt to work in different environments. The snowtroopers seen on the snow covered planet Hoth at the start of Empire Stikes Back are an example of specialized troopers. They wear special armor that is made to help protect them from the cold. Other examples of specialized troopers include the TIE pilots from A New Hope and the scout troopers seen on Endor in Return of the Jedi. There are many other types of troopers in the Star Wars books, comics and video games. == Other websites == * on Wookieepedia .
