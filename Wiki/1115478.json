He is known for his work on Islam and for talking with people of other beliefs. Al-Faruqi studied at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, and later taught in North America, at places like McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and at Temple University in the United States. At Temple University, he started the Islamic Studies program. He also helped start the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). Al-Faruqi wrote many books and articles, including Christian Ethics and Al Tawhid: Its Implications for Thought and Life. His writings explained Islamic teachings, right and wrong, belief in one God, and how to build understanding between different religions. ==Life story== ===Early life and education=== Al-Faruqi was born in Jaffa, which was part of British-mandate Palestine. His father worked as a judge of Islamic law. Al-Faruqi learned at home and at the mosque when he was young. In 1936, he began attending a school taught by French teachers. In 1942, Al-Faruqi worked for the British Mandate government in Jerusalem. By 1945, he became the district leader of Galilee. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, he moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and studied at the American University of Beirut. Later, he went to Indiana University and earned a master’s degree in philosophy in 1949. He completed another master’s degree at Harvard University in 1951 and a PhD at Indiana University in 1952. Al- Faruqi’s studies led him to believe that moral values do not change. This encouraged him to reconnect with his Islamic roots and study more about Islam at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. ===Academic career=== In 1958, al- Faruqi began teaching at McGill University’s Faculty of Divinity. He joined McGill's Institute of Islamic Studies and taught there until 1961. Then, he taught for two years at the Central Institute of Islamic Research in Karachi, Pakistan. In 1964, he returned to the United States and taught at the University of Chicago and Syracuse University. In 1968, he joined Temple University, where he started the Islamic Studies program. He worked there until he died in 1986. In 1977, al-Faruqi helped plan a big meeting in Makkah about Muslim education. This meeting led to the opening of many new Islamic schools. In 1980, al-Faruqi helped start the IIIT. He wrote a lot about Islam and speaking with people of other beliefs. He wrote over 100 articles and 25 books. Al-Faruqi also encouraged talks between different beliefs, focusing on what Islam, Christianity, and Judaism share to make peace. ===Ideas and beliefs=== Al-Faruqi first focused on Arabism, the idea that Arabic language and culture are very important for Muslims to stay united as one group (ummah). He believed learning Arabic was important for understanding the Quran and Islam. Later, he saw Islam as a universal religion meant for all people, not just Arabic speakers. Al-Faruqi’s main belief was tawhid (belief in one God). He said this idea connects all parts of life, like how people live, treat others and think about the world. He believed tawhid was the key to help Muslims unite and improve their lives. He did not agree with mysticism, like Sufism, because he thought it focused too much on personal feelings instead of using reason and solving real-world problems. He admired early Islamic thinkers, like the Mu'tazilites, who used logic to study religion. Al-Faruqi also believed Muslims should study nature and science, but always in line with Islamic values. He developed \"Islamization of knowledge,\" a way to mix Islamic ideas with modern knowledge. He believed this would help Muslims solve modern problems while keeping their faith. Al-Faruqi thought that Muslim schools copied too much from the West and needed to include Islamic teachings in subjects like science, education, and economics. Some critics, like Ibrahim Kalin, said he focused too much on history and philosophy and not enough on natural sciences, which are also important today. Al-Faruqi worked in comparative religion, which studies how religions are alike and different. He believed Islam, Christianity, and Judaism shared many ideas, like belief in one God. He thought studying other religions could help people understand each other better and work together for peace. He said Muslims should focus on common values when talking with people of other religions, instead of arguing about differences. Al-Faruqi strongly opposed Zionism, which he believed focused on creating a Jewish state but went against the religious teachings of Judaism. He said Zionism caused harm and did not give real safety to Jewish people in Israel, who depended on weapons and outside help. Al-Faruqi believed Jewish people could live peacefully in Muslim countries if they followed Jewish law while respecting Islamic rules. ===Death=== In May 1986, al-Faruqi and his wife were killed at their home in Pennsylvania by Joseph Louis Young, also known as Yusuf Ali. Young confessed to the crime and was sentenced to death; he died in prison in 1996. Their daughter survived the attack but was badly hurt. == References == == Bibliography == This section shows books and articles written or edited by al-Faruqi.
