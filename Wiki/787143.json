 "text": "The fringed tree frog, LÃ¶nnberg's tree frog or green-eyed frog (Ranoidea eucnemis) is a frog from New Guinea and Australia. Scientists saw it on the Huon Peninsula and parts of the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. This frog lives in rainforests. It lives near streams with many rocks in them. It lays eggs during the spring and summer, 800-900 at a time. The female frog lays eggs in clumps. The tadpoles can swim well in the fast water. They become frogs after 60-80 days. This frog is not endangered now, but some of the things that humans do are bad for it. Years ago, taking trees for wood meant there was less forest for the frogs to live in. Now, the biggest dangers to the frogs are things that make their water worse, like grazing. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae Category:Frogs of Oceania",
