 "text": "Electrecord is a Romanian record label that started in 1932. It was the only record label in Communist Romania because their government believed in centralization. ==History== ===Communist Romania=== Electrecord was often told to make some recordings in Romania instead of importing them from Western Europe and the United States, which recording companies in the Soviet Union were doing. Many stories today say recordings made in Romania are worse due to their lower quality. Electrecord had to make the government, listeners and musicians happy. Electrecord released some collection discs. The most successful ones were the Formaţii de muzică pop (pop music bands) series, named Formaţii rock (rock bands) starting with the fourth one. The government did not like the word \"rock\" for a kind of music. ====After==== Electrecord became less popular from 1990 because there were other record companies in Romania. Some artists stayed. Most discs released by Electrecord since 1990 have been greatest hits albums or remastered versions of LPs. Electrecord released the album Songbird by pop singer-songwriter NAVI in June 2017. ==Artists== ==References== ==Related pages== * List of record labels ==Other websites== * Category:1932 establishments in Europe Category:1930s establishments in Romania Category:Record labels Category:Classical music Category:Jazz music Category:Pop music Category:Rock music Category:World music Category:Electronic music Category:Electronic music record labels Category:Romanian culture",
