He stayed above 250 knots, very high for the air corridor. Although the pilot instructed to reduce his speed, he never complied with it. The high speed by the Learjet, piloted by Captain Álvaro Sánchez Jiménez, caused it to come dangerously close to a Mexicana Boeing 767-300 heavy passenger plane, coming from Buenos Aires, and enter the wake of turbulence, destabilizing and shooting down the small aircraft. ==Dramatization== The accident and subsequent investigation were featured in Season 14 – Episode 8 of documentary series Air Crash Investigation. The episode was titled \"Inner City Carnage\" in the United Kingdom and Australia and \"Accident or Assassination\" in the United States and Canada. ==References== == Other websites == * * Final report of crash () * Category:2000s in Mexico Category:Mexico City Category:November 2008 events",
