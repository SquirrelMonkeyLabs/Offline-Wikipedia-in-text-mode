 "text": "The RMS Empress of Ireland was a Canadian ocean liner. It sank in the Saint Lawrence River after an accident with the Norwegian ship SS Storstad on 29 May 1914. Of the 1,477 people on the Empress, 1,012 died. The ship was launched in 1906. It had just begun its 96th voyage when it sank. The Empress of Ireland left Quebec City for Liverpool at 4:30 pm local time. The wreck of the Empress of Ireland lies in 130 feet of water. This makes it easy to access for most divers. Many artifacts from the wreck have been retrieved. ==References== Category:1914 Category:Ships of Canada Category:Disasters in Canada Category:Shipwrecks",
