 "text": "Tayabas Tagalog, or Tayabasin, is a kind of Tagalog language. It is mainly spoken by the native Tagalog people of Quezon Province (old Tayabas Province). This dialect has developed over time and still has many special words and features shaped by the province history and traditions. It is different from the Tagalog spoken in Manila because it has its own unique words, sounds, and traditions. Different towns in Quezon also have their own unique words, adding more variety to the dialect. ==Naming== Tayabas Tagalog is named after Quezon's old name, 'Tayabas,' and the main language used there, 'Tagalog.' Dr. E. Arsenio Manuel, known as the 'Dean of Filipino Anthropology,' studied this dialect. He wrote a book called A Lexicographic Study of Tayabas Tagalog of Quezon Province in 1971. This study formalized the name 'Tayabas Tagalog' for the dialect. His work is important for understanding the history and importance of this dialect. Even before World War II, the term 'Tayabasin' was commonly used to refer to this dialect or the people of the province. ==Distinct vocabulary == Tayabas Tagalog has thousands of native words not found in Bulacan-Manila Tagalog. Dr. E. Arsenio Manuel recorded this in his studies. Most of these unique words appear in oldest known dictionary, the Vocabulario De Lengua Tagala, a 1613 Spanish-Tagalog dictionary by Pedro de San Buenaventura. This shows that these words date back to the precolonial era, making Tayabas Tagalog an important link to the language's past. Many local cultural workers also have collections of words from their towns in Quezon.

It is used for different types of songs. In Quezon Province, Tayabas 'awit' is special for its twelve-syllable verses and its link to dance. It is often performed during social gatherings and celebrations, like weddings and baptisms Sample quotes from Tayabas Tagalog Awit Fragments \"Awit sa Pagpapatulog ng Bata.\" This lullaby (Tagalog: hele or oyayi) is traditionally sung to help put children to sleep with its gentle and soothing melody. > Naito na naman ang bangkang may kangkong, Kasama si Neneng sa pagbabakasyon > Saya ay maskota, tapis at patadyong, Baro, bitubito, panyong layronlayron. > Ikaw pala Neneng ay maraming damit Purongpurong sutla habing kamarines; Sino > ang magdadala, sino ang magbibitbit?
