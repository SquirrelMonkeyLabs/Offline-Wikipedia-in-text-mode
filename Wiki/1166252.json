It started first in Republican China and was often used by the Nationalist Party of China (KMT / GMD) for their military actions, like the Eastern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the first phase of the Chinese Civil War. Historically, in China, this term mainly refers to a series of revolutionary actions by the Nationalist Party and Communist Party during the First United Front from 1921 to 1927. The main focus was to fight against and remove the Beiyang Government. This campaign was called the Northern Expedition; it is also known as the First Revolutionary Civil War or the Great Revolution....孫中山：軍政府宣言 == In China == The term National Revolution was first used in the \"Declaration of Military Government\" in the book \"Revolutionary Strategy of Tongmenghui\", written by Sun Yat-sen during the early days of the Tongmenghui....孫中山：軍政府宣言 == As an ideological component == For Sun Yat-sen, social well-being can only be achieved through revolution and the creation of a new government. This idea was very important in forming the Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou (1922-1925), which led the Northern Expedition and fought against the Beiyang Government. After the Chinese Communist Revolution, Chiang Kai-shek said that the revolution was not over and that it was necessary to take back mainland China. However, for Mao Zedong and the communists, the revolution was already complete.
