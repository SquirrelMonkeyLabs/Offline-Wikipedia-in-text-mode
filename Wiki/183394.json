 "text": "Madagascar is a 1994 Cuban movie directed by Fernando Pérez. It marked his change of direction into a more lyrical approach to moviemaking, somehow stripped from the realistic documentary feel of his early work. The movie is about the relationship and lack of communication between a mother and daughter during the Cuban economic crisis known as the Special Period. The movie stars the voices of Elena Bolaños, Rolando Díaz, Daniel Díaz Torres, Zaida Castellanos, and Laura De la Uz. == Awards == * Berlin International Film Festival - Caligari Film Award * Festróia - Tróia International Film Festival - Golden Dolphin * Fribourg International Film Festival - Grand Prix * Havana Film Festival - ARCI-NOVA Award Fernando Pérez * Cuban Press Association Award - FIPRESCI Prize - Special Mention - Special Jury Prize * Sundance Film Festival - Latin America Cinema Award == Other websites == * Category:1994 drama movies Category:Cuban movies",
