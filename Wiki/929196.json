 "text": "A modern castle or mock castle is a house or mansion designed and built to resemble a medieval castle. These residences often have some castle features including towers, crenellations and even fake dungeons and moats sometimes. Mock castles have no serious defensive abilities, at least not at the same level as original medieval castles. The majority of modern castles were built in the 19th and 20th centuries, though they continue to be built occasionally today. Category:Castles",
