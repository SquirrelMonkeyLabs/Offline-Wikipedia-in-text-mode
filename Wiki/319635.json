 "text": "The Bogan River is an inland river of New South Wales, Australia. It begins at Goonumbla, near Parkes. It flows in a north west direction for about before it joins the Darling River near Bourke. The towns of Tottenham, Peak Hill and Nyngan are built on the banks of the Bogan River. The first European to see the Bogan River was Charles Sturt in 1828-9. He named it New Year Creek. However the Indigenous Australian name, Bogan, which means birthplace of a king, was the name that was used. The explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell created a painting in 1836 of an Aboriginal man, Combo, from the Bogan River. At Peak Hill, the local weir is built on Aboriginal stone fishing traps, similar to those in Brewarrina. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Rivers of New South Wales",
