 "text": "A spit is a stretch of land or sand which projects out to sea. It is joined to the mainland at one end. Spits are created by deposition of sand. Spits are formed where the prevailing wind blows at an angle to the coastline. The sand on the beach is moved by the waves along the shore, which is called 'longshore drift'. The sand collects at the end to form a spit. An example of a spit is Spurn Head, along the Holderness coast in Humberside near Hull. Category:Landforms",
