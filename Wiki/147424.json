For a complete list of historical tram operators, see list of tram operators There have been two separate generations of trams in London, from 1860 to 1952 and from 2000. Between 1952 and 2000 no trams ran in London. The decision to abolish the first generation of trams was taken in a way which allowed various interested groups to have a say, but with little or no consultation to or with the general population. The debate was largely about trams on London, and made in a way which reflected the time when the British Labour Party controlled both London and the UK.The Campaign To Save the London Trams 1946-1952 The first trams in London were authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1870. They were, of course, horse-drawn at that time,Tramways Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict c 78) although steam power was also possible. == References == Category:Trams in London",
