 "text": "Linda Taylor (born Martha Louise White; c. January 1926 â€“ April 18, 2002) was an American criminal. She committed welfare fraud and, after an article in the Chicago Tribune in fall 1974, became known as the \"welfare queen\". Her activities were used by Ronald Reagan, from his 1976 presidential campaign onwards, to defend his criticisms of social programs in the United States. Reprinted from The Washington Star. Her criminal activities are believed to have extended beyond welfare fraud and may have included assault, theft, insurance fraud, bigamy, the abduction and sale of children, and possibly even murder. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:American fraudsters Category:Criminals from Chicago Category:People from Tennessee",
