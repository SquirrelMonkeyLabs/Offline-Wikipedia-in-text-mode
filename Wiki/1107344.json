 "text": "GPTZero is a software used on a computer. It tries to tell if a human wrote a text or a robot, like ChatGPT. The software was made by Edward Tian, a computer science student at Princeton University. The software looks at various linguistic features and patterns to tell how likely it is that a text was produced by a human or an AI. GPTZero became popular because of the use of AI for making content, which has raised concerns about authenticity, originality, and potential misuse. == References == Category:Generative artificial intelligence Category:Software Category:Web software",
