 "text": "A cue stick (or simply cue), is a kind of stick used for sports like pool, snooker and carom billiards. It is used to hit a ball, normally the cue ball. Cues are fixed-up sticks, normally about 58 inches (1.5 m) long and 18–21 ounces (510–600 g). Most cues are made of wood, but sometimes the wood is covered with other materials like carbon fiber or fiberglass. An old term for a cue, used from the 16th to early 19th centuries, is \"billiard stick\". ==References== Category:Cue sports",
