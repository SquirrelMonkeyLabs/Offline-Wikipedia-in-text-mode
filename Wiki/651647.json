 "text": "Psycho is a 1998 horror movie directed by Gus Van Sant. It is a shot-for-shot remake of the original Psycho movie. That means all the parts of the movie were made in the same way as the original, the only difference being that it's now in color and has stereo sound. The film was not liked by many critics and audiences for that reason. ==Cast== *Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates *Anne Heche as Marion Crane *Julianne Moore == Other websites == * Psycho on IMDb * Psycho on Rotten Tomatoes Category:1998 horror movies Category:1990s psychological movies Category:1998 LGBT movies Category:American horror movies Category:American psychological movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:American movie remakes Category:Dissociative identity disorder in movies Category:Movies directed by Gus Van Sant Category:Paramount Pictures movies Category:Movies about embezzlement Category:Movies set in California Category:Movies set in Arizona",
