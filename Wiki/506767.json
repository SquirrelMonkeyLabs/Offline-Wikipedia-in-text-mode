 "text": "The 2016 presidential campaign of Martin O'Malley, the 61st Governor of Maryland, for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 2016 was announced on May 30, 2015 and suspended on February 1, 2016. ==Background== O'Malley had been seen as a potential presidential candidate since at least December 2012. In that month, he said that Hillary Clinton, who has launched her own 2016 campaign, would be a \"great President\", brushing off questions about his own potential candidacy and commenting that he would have to do \"a lot of soul-searching and discernment and introspection.\" ==Announcement== The day prior to his announcement, May 29, O'Malley released a video of himself strumming the presidential fanfare Hail to the Chief on his guitar, alluding to his impending announcement. The following day, May 30, O'Malley launched his campaign at a scheduled rally in Baltimore, Maryland. ==Suspension== O'Malley suspended his campaign after poor polling numbers and a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses. ==References== O'Malley",
