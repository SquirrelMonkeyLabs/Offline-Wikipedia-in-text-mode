 "text": "Friedrich Burgmüller (Johann Friedrich Franz Burgmüller, 4 December 1806 – 13 February 1874) was a German pianist and composer. He was born in Regensberg, Germany, to a musical family. In 1832, he settled in Paris and adopted the French musical style. He wrote many works for piano, especially etudes for children that are still played today. His best known work is probably the Peasant pas de deus (originally Souvenirs de Ratisbonne) in Adolphe Adam's ballet Giselle (1841). It is not known how this music came to be inserted into the ballet. == Other websites == *Free scores Mutopia Project *Link to Recording of the Opus 100 Etudes at the Piano Society Website *Description of the Opus 100 Etudes by Noriaki Nomoto * Category:1806 births Category:1874 deaths Category:19th-century German composers",
