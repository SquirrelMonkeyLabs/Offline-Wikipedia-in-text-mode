It is owned by CME (Central European Media Enterprises), which is owned by PPF Group. Since 3 September 1999, the company has also been broadcasting its own signal for the Republic of Moldova, under the Pro TV Chișinău brand. It broadcasts, in addition to Pro TV Bucharest programs (according to its own grid, different from the Romanian one), a series of local news and programs and its own advertising slots throughout the day. Targeting urban adults aged 21 to 54, Pro TV uses a programming strategy of top international series and movies, as well as a wide variety of local productions including news programming, local entertainment and local fiction. On 29 August 2014, Pro TV launched its own streaming service, called Pro TV Plus, dedicated to original series. Later, in 2021, it was replaced by Voyo(Romanian), which has the same series and original shows of the Pro channels, plus some other exclusives and original content. Since 2014, the idents for commercials and promos have become more different from those of other stations, focusing on the stars appearing in the station's shows. During the summer, idents are used that present activities that are practiced in the summer, while in the winter, idents are used that present things and activities related to the winter holidays, but also things related to winter. == References == == External links == * Pro TV * Știrile Pro TV * Category:Television channels in Romania",
