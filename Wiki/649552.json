 "text": "Michelle von Emster (2 August 1968 - 1994) was a 25-year-old woman who was fatally attacked by an unknown person. She died off the coast of San Diego, California at night. Soon after, two surfers found her body. Her right leg was missing from her mid thigh, and there were tear marks all over her body, suggesting to investigators that she had been attacked by a great white shark. In addition, she had sand in her stomach and other organs, and her neck was broken. In addition, when experts were later shown the body, some claimed the injuries did not match the measurements of a great white shark. ==References== ==Other websites== * Revisiting the mysterious death of Michelle von Emster Category:1994 deaths Category:Unexplained deaths Category:History of San Diego Category:1994 in California Category:Triathletes",
