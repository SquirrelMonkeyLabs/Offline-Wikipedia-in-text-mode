 "text": "The fez (, plural fezzes or fezes from Arabic \"Fas\" the main town in Morocco before 1927),. as well as its equivalent, the tarboosh (), is a felt hat. There are two types of fezzes. One is a cone with a flat top, made of red felt. The other is a short cylinder made of kilim fabric. Both usually have a tassel attached to the top. The tarboosh and the modern fez, which is similar, owe much of their development and popularity to the Ottoman era... In 1925, the fez was banned in Turkey by the President, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. Since 1925, the fez is not a part of Turkish men's clothing. == References == Category:Hats",
