 "text": "The Eurovision Song Contest 1993 was the 38th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It was held in Millstreet, Ireland after their win in the previous contest. The show was held on 15 May 1993 and was hosted by Fionnula Sweeney (an Irish reporter). == Pre-selection == Due to many new countries being formed in Eastern Europe, mainly because of the fall of Yugoslavia, there were too many countries applying to be in the 1993 contest. As such, a pre- selection contest held in Ljubljana was created, where the three highest- scoring Eastern countries were allowed to participate in the 1993 contest. It was titled Kvalifikacija za Millstreet (translates to: Preselection for Millstreet). Seven countries took part in the contest. The winners were decided by voting from music experts (called the jury). There was one jury from each participating country. Each juror awarded twelve points to their favourite entry, followed by ten points to their second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to five for the remaining songs, excluding the entry from their own country. === Leaderboard === Country Artist Song Points Place 1 Bosnia and Herzegovina Fazla \"\" 52 2nd 2 Put \"Don't Ever Cry\" 51 3rd 3 Janika Sillamaa \"Muretut meelt ja südametuld\" 47 5th 4 Andrea Szulák \"Árva reggel\" 44 6th 5 Dida Drăgan \"Nu pleca\" 38 7th 6 1X Band \"\" 54 1st 7 Elán \"Amnestia na neveru\" 50 4th == Overview == 25 countries took part in the contest. Aside from the three qualifiers from the pre-selection (who were formerly part of Yugoslavia), all countries from the 1992 contest returned. The winner was decided by experts (jury) from each participating country. The juries gave points to their top ten favorite entries.
