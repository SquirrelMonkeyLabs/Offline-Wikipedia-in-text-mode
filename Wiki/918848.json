 "text": "Alghoza is a combination of musical wind instruments. The Baloch, Saraiki, Sindhi, Kutchi, Punjabi and Rajasthani folk music artists play these instruments. It is also called Alghoze, Jōrhi, Pāwā Jōrhī, Do Nālī, Donāl, Girāw, Satārā or Nagōze. == Origin == This musical grouping first happened around 7500 BC in Mesopotamia. Then it reached Iran and eventually Pakistan. It had some changes on the way. Some old Mesopotamian paintings show a musical instrument very similar to Alghoza. In Mesopotamia, this instrument was called \"Al-Joza\", which literally means, \"the twin\". As it reached Pakistan, the \"J\" in \"Al-Joza\" became \"gh\" and eventually the modified form of this instrument which reached Pakistan came to be known as Alghoza. The Alghoza (Sindhi: الغوزو) is a paired woodwind instrument. It is traditionally used by Baloch, Saraiki, Sindhi, Kutchi, Punjabi and Rajasthani folk musicians. It consists of two joined beak flutes, one for melody, the second for drone. The flutes are either tied together or may be held together loosely with the hands. == References == Category:Musical instruments",
