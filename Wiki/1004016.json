It is alleged that he paid hush money to pornographic movie actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 United States presidential election. (Hush money is a bribe to maintain secrecy - to prevent bad publicity or to prevent the discovery of a crime.)

Trump pleaded not guilty to all the charges. After the court hearing, Trump traveled by plane back home to Florida.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us- canada-65182264. BBC.
