 "text": "The National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or the Gaokao, is the People's Republic of China's national-level university entrance exam. All high school students in China must take the Gaokao in their last year of school, and much of their time in high school is spent preparing to take the exam. Like many other Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and India, the Gaokao has been well-known around the world for being a very difficult exam because many students do not get a high enough score to attend university in China. The required subjects are mathematics, Chinese and English, and the full score of each three subjects is 150 points. For the other subjects, there are two choices: the liberal arts comprehensive are history, geography and politics, with a score of 100 for each subject; The science subjects include physics, chemistry and biology, with 100 points for each subject. Students can choose between science and liberal arts based on what they want to study, and each student can score a maximum of 750 points. In the national college entrance examination in June 2018, 9.75 million people took the exam, which shows the great pressure of competition. One of the disadvantages of Chinese education is that it only takes one exam to select talents. However, because there are too many references, the nation can only select talents through examinations. Facts have proved that this selection method still has some merits.
