Legendary critic Roger Ebert said that Kael \"had a more positive influence on the climate for film in America than any other single person over the last three decades\". Kael was born in Petaluma, California. She studied at the University of California, Berkeley. Kael died in Great Barrington, Massachusetts from Parkinson's disease at the age of 82. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Pauline Kael Archives , a collection of articles and commentary about Kael * The Pearls of Pauline from Brights Lights Film Journal * Interview magazine q&a; Pauline Kael interviewed by Polly Frost and Ray Sawhill Category:1919 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:American movie critics Category:Writers from California Category:Writers from New York City",
