 "text": "A fishing rod is a tool used for catching fish.Guinness World Records - Longest fishing rod The rod is often used to cast a fishing hook to where the fish are. The hook has bait on it, sometimes an artificial bait. There is usually some way to make the line longer or shorter, and the pole it is can bend a little. This is called angling and it is how people catch fish for fun or sport. Commercial fishing is usually done using fishing nets. ==Modern== Modern fishing rods are designed to be lightweight, durable, and flexible. They are made of materials like graphite, fiberglass, and bamboo. Graphite rods are light and great for long and accurate casts. Fiberglass rods are heavier but more affordable and durable, making them suitable for rugged conditions. Bamboo rods have a unique feel but are heavier. The handles are usually cork, and the guides can be made of steel or titanium. Some rods have back- or butt-rests for better control when fighting large fish. Overall, modern fishing rods prioritize lightness, durability, and performance. ==References== Category:Sports equipment Category:Tools Category:Fishing",
