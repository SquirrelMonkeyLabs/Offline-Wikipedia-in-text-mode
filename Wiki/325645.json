 "text": "The flash point of a volatile substance is the lowest temperature at which it can become vapor, mix with air, and burn. The flash point describes liquid fuel. It helps to tell about the danger of fire from liquids. “Flash point” can describe both flammable liquids and combustible liquids. == Measurement == Several national and international committees and organizations decide how everyone should measure the flash point. The three main groups that decide this standard for measurement are the CEN / ISO Joint Working Group on Flash Point (JWG-FP), ASTM D02.8B Flammability Section, and the Energy Institute's TMS SC-B-4 Flammability Panel. The standard for testing the temperature of the flash point tells the equipment, units of measure, the steps to follow, and the precision of the test method. Category:Chemistry Category:Fire",
