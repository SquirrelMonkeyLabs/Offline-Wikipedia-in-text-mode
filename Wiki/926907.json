 "text": "Flossie Donnelly (born 2007) is an Irish person who studies about the sea environment. She is a school student. She was the first person to bring seabin machines to Ireland. She was making money for two of the machines. Those machines remove plastics from the waters. She appears on the RTE News to show her works. Donnelly regularly works for climates either outside her school or at the parliament. She makes cleanups near the sea in Dún Laoghaire and Sandycove. It was along the local South Dublin near the seas. She started an environmental group called \"Flossie & the Beach Cleaners\". It collects money for environmental works. It was when she was eleven years old. With that, she told people about plastic pollution and its results in the sea life. She collected €4,000 for two seabin machines into Ireland. The machines can remove up to 83,000 plastic bags or 20,000 plastic bottles from the sea in one year. On World Oceans Day 2018, she led Ireland's only March for the Ocean event in Dún Laoghaire. She spoke at a TEDx Dún Laoghaire event in October 2018. In October 2019, RTÉjr said that they would follow Donnelly's works to the Citarum River in Indonesia. It is one of the world's dirtiest 'plastic' rivers. She was related to a true story recorded movie named My Story: The Beach Cleaner. This was one of her many works for people. She did it with school children in Ireland. It was on the works to stop plastic pollution. == References == Category:2007 births Category:Environmentalists Category:Climate activists Category:Living people Category:People with dyslexia",
