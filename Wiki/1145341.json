 "text": "A Warehouse club is a retail store that sells different types of goods. The clubs are able to keep prices low due to the no-frills format of the stores. This means products are mostly sold without any unnecessary features. They are different from cash-and-carry wholesale businesses since their warehouses are larger in size. They also allow some or all types of consumers to get memberships and not just businesses. Category:Shops",
