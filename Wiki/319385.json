In 1993, Czechoslovakia was divided into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Each of these countries sent their own teams to the Olympics since 1994. Czechoslovakian athletes have won a total of 143 medals at the Summer Games. Most of these medals were won in gymnastics. The nation also won 25 medals at the Winter Games.
