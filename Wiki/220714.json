 "text": "Chowder is an American animated television series that started on Cartoon Network on November 2, 2007. The show was created by C.H. Greenblatt, a former storyboard artist on SpongeBob SquarePants and The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy. The title character is a young child named Chowder. Chowder is a student to a chef named Mung Daal, who owns a baking company serving the fictional \"Marzipan City\". The show has animation with stop motion animation and puppetry. == Plot == The series revolves around the titular Chowder, a cat-bear-rabbit hybrid and aspiring young cook at Chef Mung Daal's catering company. Though he is lighthearted and carefree, Chowder's actions habitually land him in circumstances beyond his control, partly due to his large appetite and absent-mindedness. Mung and his wife Truffles, Mung's rock monster employee Schnitzel, and Chowder's gaseous pet Kimchi all try to aid Chowder in his ambitions to become a great chef, but frequently find themselves undermined by the calamitous antics that ensue. Chowder is also undermined by Panini, a girl who has an unrequited love for Chowder, going so far as to say that he is her boyfriend despite the pair not actually dating. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Chowder (voiced by Nicky Jones): A chubby lavender hybrid who serves as an apprentice under the chef Mung Daal, Chowder lives with Mung Daal and his wife, Truffles, in a room at the top of the catering business. Chowder wants to become a great chef, but he is very impulsive and scatterbrained and often gives in to his urges. He is always hungry and eats anything, even a customer's order. Chowder can also regurgitate objects, and he is used as a storage container by the other characters. According to Greenblatt, he is a composite of a cat, a bear, and a rabbit, and his species was verified in at least one episode. C.H. Greenblatt voiced his adult self in the last episode. In the final episode, \"Chowder Grows Up\" Chowder takes over the Catering Company, has his own apprentice, and marries Panini. He is also a father to 50 babies. * Mung Daal (voiced by Dwight Schultz): The elderly goblin chef who runs the catering company at which Chowder works. He serves as Chowder's cooking master. Although his exact age has not been stated, he has mentioned that he has cooked for at least 386 years, and he celebrated 450 years of marriage to Truffles (see below). He likes to impress ladies, to the point where as a child apprentice, he prepared a dish incorrectly due to becoming distracted, which he and Chowder had to time travel to fix. He is a light blue-colored humanoid with an oversized nose and ears and is named after the Indian dish mung daal. Greenblatt had originally planned to give Mung an Indian accent, but later decided against it. ==Episodes== ;Season 1 (2007-2008) No. Title Date shown 1 The Froggy Apple Crumble Thumpkin/Chowderâ€™s Girlfriend (New Series) November 2, 2007 2 Burple Nurples/Shnitzel Makes a Deposit November 2, 2007 3 Grubble Gum/The Cinamini Monster November 9, 2007 4 Certifrycation Class/Sing Beans November 16, 2007 5 The Wrong Address/The Wrong Customer November 23, 2007 6 Mahjongg Night/Stinky Love November 30, 2007 7 The Thrice Cream Man/The Flibber-Flabber Diet December 7, 2007 8 Gispacho Stands Up/A Taste of Marzapan December 14, 2007 9 The Puckerberry Overloads/The Elemelons January 18, 2008 10 Sniffleball/Mung on the Rocks March 6, 2008 11 The Moldy Touch/The Heavy Sleeper April 3, 2008 12 At Your Service/Chowder and Mr. Fugu May 1, 2008 13 The Vacation/The Sleep Eater June 5, 2008 14 The Bruised Bluenana/Shnitzel and the Lead Farfel June 12, 2008 15 The Thousand Pound Cake/The Rat Sandwich June 19, 2008 16 Chowder Loses His Hat/Brain Grub June 26, 2008 17 Shnitzel Quits July 3, 2008 18 The Broken Part/The Meach Harvest July 10, 2008 19 Banned from the Stand/Creme Puff Hands July 17, 2008 20 The Apprentice Games July 24, 2008 ;Season 2 (2008-2009) No. Title Date shown 21 The Arborians/The Garage Sale October 2, 2008 22 Panini for President/Chowder's Babysitter November 6, 2008 23 The Fire Breather/The Flying Finger Lingons November 13, 2008 24 Hey Hey It's Knishmas!
