In 2016, he voted for Donald Trump as President of the United States. Fuentes later dropped out of college and went to Charlottesville to protest taking down a statue of Robert E. Lee. ==Political Positions== Fuentes says he’s not on the Alt-right and calls himself an America Firster or a Groyper. Fuentes once implied that he didn’t believe that the Holocaust happened but then said he was just telling a joke because “I’m an irony bro”. Fuentes said that he thought women voting was a bad idea and that miscegenation was almost as bad as bestiality. Fuentes said that people should stop complaining about segregation because “it was better for us, it was better for them”. Fuentes said that a man should beat up his wife if she “deserves it”. Fuentes joked about wanting to kill Ben Shapiro. Fuentes said that Matt Walsh from The Daily Wire was a “Shabbos goy race traitor” and called Dave Rubin “Jewy Jewstein” and criticized Rubin for being “gay and Jewish”. Fuentes called Jordan Peterson a “glorified self-help guru”. Fuentes also said that Steven Crowder was an “open borders cuck” and had his supporters shout down Candace Owens and Donald Trump Jr. at Turning Point USA for supporting legal immigration. Fuentes also criticized the Republican Party of the United States for supporting Israel. When Donald Trump said that white supremacy was bad, Fuentes said that Trump shouldn’t have said that and that saying that was “cucked and blue pilled”. Fuentes supported the riot in January 6th 2021. Fuentes also supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine and said that Vladimir Putin being like Hitler in Ukraine wouldn’t be a bad thing. ==Associations== Both Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene caused controversy by going to events with Fuentes. In 2022, Fuentes went to Mar-a-Lago and had a meal with Donald Trump, Milo Yiannopoulos and Kanye West. ==Timcast interview== When Fuentes, Yiannopoulos and West went on Tim Pool’s podcast and said that the Jews control the news media Tim Pool said that this wasn’t true so West left the interview and then Fuentes also did. ==Alex Jones Interview== Fuentes went on Alex Jones’s show with Kanye West and they both complained about Tim Pool not wanting them to complain about the Jews with West saying that he liked Hitler. == Legal issues == On November 27, 2024, Fuentes was charged with battery following an incident earlier that month in which he allegedly maced an activist who came to his suburban Chicago home. == References == Category:1998 births Category:American political commentators Category:Living people",
