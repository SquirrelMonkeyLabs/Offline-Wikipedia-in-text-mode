 "text": "Erotic wrestling is a kind of wrestling, done by women or men, usually as a show, like at the Burning Man. These Wrestlers are often covered in oil. They usually wear very little clothing or they are completely naked. It often is part of adult entertainment. Even though the wrestlers are often also covered in oil, this has nothing to do with oil wrestling, which is done by clothed men, as a sport. ==References== Category:Wrestling",
