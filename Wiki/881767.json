Hijras are a marginalized transgender community living in sequestered groups in many cities of India and Pakistan. The language, also known as Koti Farsi, is spoken by the hijra community throughout Pakistan and North India (except West Bengal). It is based on Hindustani and not Farsi, as suggested by the name. The sentence structure is similar to Urdu with noticeable distinctions.Sheeraz, Muhammad, and Ayaz Afsar. \"Farsi: An Invisible But Loaded Weapon for the Emerging Hijraism in Pakistan.\" Kashmir Journal of Language Research 14, no. 2 (2011).
