People have seen this frog between 1770 and 2130 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists believe the male frogs carry tadpoles on their backs. The male frogs take the tadpoles to water. Scientists have seen the tadpoles swimming in water in bromeliad plants. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives, especially to dig rocks and metals out of the ground and bad chemicals in the water. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
