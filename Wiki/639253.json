 "text": "Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, or simply Professor, is a fictional character in the American television series Futurama voiced by Billy West and created by Matt Groening. Farnsworth is the mad scientist of the Planet Express delivery service. He is the great (Ã—30) nephew of Philip J. Fry. He sometimes acts between intelligence and amoral senility due to his greatly advanced age. He shows intelligence of any field of science necessary for the series' plots, and is thought to be one of the most brilliant inventors on Earth. However, he falls asleep constantly, and he is implied to have routinely sent his former crews on suicide missions. His character is influenced by Frank Morgan and Burgess Meredith. Farnsworth's design has been compared to a combination of Mr. Burns, Grampa Simpson, and Professor Frink from Matt Groening's other series, The Simpsons. ==References== Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1999 Category:Futurama characters Category:Mad scientists",
