Following her husband's abdication, his reign ended the German Empire and the Hohenzollern dynasty's 300-year rule of Prussia. == Biography == === Early life === Augusta Victoria was born at Dolzig Castle, the eldest daughter of Frederick VIII and Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a niece of Queen Victoria, through Victoria's half-sister Feodora. She was known within her family as Dona. === Crown Princess === On 27 February 1881, Augusta married her half-second cousin Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. Augusta's maternal grandmother Princess Feodora of Leiningen was the half-sister of Queen Victoria, who was Wilhelm's maternal grandmother. === Empress === Augusta became the German empress and Queen of Prussia in 1888 after her father-in-law Frederick III died. She served as the empress and Queen until her husband's forced abdication in 1918, following the German Revolution. === Later life === In 1920, the shock of exile and abdication, combined with the breakdown of Joachim's marriage and his subsequent suicide, proved too much for Augusta's health. She died in 1921, in Huis Doorn at Doorn in the Netherlands. She was buried in Antique Temple, Sanssouci Park, Potsdam, Germany. == References == Category:1858 births Category:1921 deaths Category:House of Hohenzollern Category:Empresses consort Category:German princes and princesses Category:People from Berlin Category:People from Prussia",
