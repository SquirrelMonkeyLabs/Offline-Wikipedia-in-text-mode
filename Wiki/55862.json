 "text": "Coheed and Cambria (sometimes abbreviated to \"Coheed,\" \"CO & CA\" or \"C&C;\") is an American rock band from New York. Coheed and Cambria have made four studio albums, two live albums, and some special albums. Their studio albums are concept albums, showing one story broken into parts. The band wants to make five albums telling the story of The Amory Wars. Now, four albums have been released: The Second Stage Turbine Blade, In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness, and Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow, and Year of the Black Rainbow. These albums make the first, second, third, and fourth part of the four-part story of Coheed and Cambria. The albums have been made out of order; the second part was made first, and the first part has been made last. ==History== ===Early Days (1995)=== When a band called Toxic Parents, with Claudio Sanchez and Travis Stever in it, broke up about the same time as Nate Kelley's band, Moe & The Boogie Cats, the members of these bands came together to form a new band in March 1995. This band was called Beautiful Loser. It had Travis Stever singing and playing guitar, Claudio Sanchez on guitar, Nate Kelley on drums and Jon Carleo on bass. The group did not last long, it broke up in June 1995; they had an argument about gas money. Stever left the band, and Kelley was kicked out, but he came back when Sanchez asked him to. Without Stever, the band only had three people, so Sanchez started to sing and play guitar. === Shabütie=== They changed their name to Shabütie, a chant taken from the movie \"The Naked Prey\". The band constantly changed and experimented with different genres and styles, never properly deciding a set genre. When Carleo left the band in August 1996, Kelley asked Michael Todd to join the band, who he had worked with in an acoustic project called \"Esme 9\". Todd, a guitar player, started playing bass because of Shabütie. ===Coheed and Cambria (2000 — 2006)=== After Kelley left, Sanchez and the other people picked Josh Eppard, who was in the band \"3\", to take his place. In 2001, shortly after The Delirium Trigger EP was made, they changed their name to Coheed and Cambria and Shabütie was finished. The band was now a four piece: Claudio Sanchez, (lead vocals/guitar), Travis Stever, (backup vocals/guitar), Michael Todd, (backup vocals/bass guitar), and Josh Eppard, (drums). When playing live, Dave Parker (keyboards/guitar), sometimes plays too. ===Recent times (2006—)=== Josh Eppard could not play at Coheed and Cambria's June 9 slot at the Download Festival in the UK because he was ill. A few days later, the band canceled the Barcelona and Essen parts of their European tour. In November 2006, it was announced that both Josh Eppard and Mic Todd had left the band. A few months after, Mic Todd returned to work on the No World For Tomorrow with the band. It was announced a few days before the band embarked on Warped Tour '07 that Chris Pennie, the former drummer for Dillinger Escape Plan, is working with the band in studio. The band debuted their first single from No World For Tomorrow, The Running Free during Warped Tour '07. In July, a website registered to Sony appeared on the internet, www.noworldfortomorrow.com. This website contained a countdown. After this countdown ended, a message was released and another countdown appeared. This showed that a message would be released weekly. An archive of the messages released can be found here . On October 23, 2007 The band's forth studio album was released under the name \"Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow\" It was met with positive reviews from online zines such as Rollingstone.com and Absolutepunk.net. ==Influences and similarities== Sanchez has said that he is influenced by bands like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Thin Lizzy, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Yes and many people say that they sound like Rush. But, Claudio Sanchez has said that he never listened to the band until he heard people say that they sounded like each other. Metal Hammer magazine called the band the \"new Led Zeppelin\" on the front cover of issue 153. They also have hardcore punk influences such as Bad Brains and The Misfits. Claudio also said in an interview he learned to play guitar by listening to the Misfits' Legacy of Brutality. ==Other projects== * The Amory Wars (previously called The Bag On Line Adventures) – Claudio Sanchez's comic book series telling the story of Coheed and Cambria.

Similarly, a cover of The Band's \"I Shall Be Released\" was uploaded onto the bands MySpace page as a Christmas Present to their fans in 2006. The band also used to play a cover of Iron Maiden's \"The Trooper\" at concerts. A song called \"The Glass\" was in the process of being written for the movie Spiderman 2's soundtrack, but the song was not finished in time and it was scrapped. Many Shabütie songs are circulated on the internet. Some were recorded in a studio, but others were recorded on a 4-track, resulting in poor quality audio. There is also a live bootleg on the internet of a song played by Shabütie that fans named \"Nauraushaun\". It was assumed that this song was one song in full, but former drummer Nate Kelley has recently told fans that the song was in fact two songs played in a medley. These two songs are \"Origins\" and \"Life Without You\". These two songs were never recorded except for the bootleg that has been circulating, although \"Life Without You\" was almost recorded instead of \"Cassiopeia\". In the end the band decided they liked \"Cassiopeia\" more and this was recorded instead. ===EPs & Other Albums=== Year Title Label 1999 Plan to Take Over the World (as Shabűtie) Wisteria Records 1999 The Penelope EP (as Shabűtie) Wisteria Records 2000 Delirium Trigger (as Shabűtie) Wisteria Records 2004 Live at the Starland Ballroom EVR/Columbia 2004 Live at La Zona Rosa EVR/Columbia 2005 Live at the Avalon EVR/Columbia 2006 Kerrang! / XFM UK Acoustic Sessions iTunes Exclusive 2009 Neverender 12% Columbia ===Singles=== Year Title Label Album 2003 \"Devil in Jersey City\" Equal Vision The Second Stage Turbine Blade 2004 \"A Favor House Atlantic\" Equal Vision/Columbia In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 2004 \"Blood Red Summer\" Equal Vision/Columbia In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 2005 \"The Suffering\" Equal Vision/Columbia Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness 2005 \"Welcome Home\" Equal Vision/Columbia Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness 2006 \"Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial)\" Equal Vision/Columbia Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness 2007 \"The Running Free\" Equal Vision/Columbia Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 2: No World For Tomorrow 2008 \"Feathers\" Equal Vision/Columbia Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 2: No World For Tomorrow 2010 \"The Broken\" Equal Vision/Columbia Year of the Black Rainbow 2010 \"Here We Are Juggernaut\" Year of the Black Rainbow 2010 \"World of Lines\" Year of the Black Rainbow 2012 \"Key Entity Extraction I: Domino the Destitute\" The Afterman: Ascension 2012 \"The Afterman\" The Afterman: Ascension 2013 \"Dark Side of Me\" The Afterman: Descension 2015 \"You Got Spirit, Kid\" The Color Before the Sun 2015 \"Here to Mars\" The Color Before the Sun 2018 \"The Dark Sentencer\" Vaxis – Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures 2018 \"Unheavenly Creatures\" Vaxis – Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures 2018 \"The Gutter\" Vaxis – Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures 2018 \"Old Flames\" Vaxis – Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures 2020 \"Jessie's Girl 2\"\" (featuring Rick Springfield) non-album single ===Chart Positions=== Year Title Chart positions Album Modern Rock Tracks chart|Modern Rock Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 UK Singles 2004 A Favor House Atlantic 13 40 – – In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 2005 Blood Red Summer 29 – – – In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 2005 The Suffering 16 29 – 60 Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness 2006 Welcome Home 36 24 – – Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness == Music videos == Year Video Album 2003 Delirium Trigger The Second Stage Turbine Blade Features on the In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 bonus DVD. 2003 Devil in Jersey City The Second Stage Turbine Blade 2003 Devil in Jersey City (alternative video) The Second Stage Turbine Blade Features on the In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 bonus DVD. 2004 A Favor House Atlantic In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 2004 Blood Red Summer In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 2005 Welcome Home Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness 2005 The Suffering Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness 2006 Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial) Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness 2006 The Willing Well IV: the Final Cut Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness Made by Sanchez and his girlfriend and released unofficially. 2007 The Running Free Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 2: No World For Tomorrow 2008 Feathers Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 2: No World For Tomorrow 2008 Gravemakers & Gunslingers Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Vol. 2: No World For Tomorrow Made by Sanchez and features clips from live performances.
