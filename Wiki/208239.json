 "text": "The wavelet transform is a time-frequency representation of a signal. For example, we use it for noise reduction, feature extraction or signal compression. Wavelet transform of continuous signal is defined as : \\left[W_\\psi f\\right](a,b) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty{f(t)\\psi^*\\left(\\frac{t-b}{a}\\right)}dt\\,, where * \\psi is so called mother wavelet, * a denotes wavelet dilation, * b denotes time shift of wavelet and * * symbol denotes complex conjugate. In case of a = {a_{0}}^{m} and b = {a_{0}}^{m}kT, where a_{0}>1, T>0 and m and k are integer constants, the wavelet transform is called discrete wavelet transform (of continuous signal). In case of a = 2^m and b = 2^{m}kT, where m>0, the discrete wavelet transform is called dyadic. It is defined as : \\left[W_\\psi f\\right](m,k) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^m}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty{f(t)\\psi^*\\left(2^{-m}t-kT\\right)}dt\\,, where * m is frequency scale, * k is time scale and * T is constant which depends on mother wavelet. It is possible to rewrite dyadic discrete wavelet transform as :\\left[W_\\psi f\\right](m,k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty{f(t) h_{m}\\left(2^{m}kT-t\\right)}dt\\,, where h_{m} is impulse characteristic of continuous filter which is identical to {\\psi_{m}}^* for given m. Analogously, dyadic wavelet transform with discrete time (of discrete signal) is defined as :y_{m}[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f[k]h_{m}[2^{m}n-k].
