It stars Jessica Biel, Jake Gyllenhaal, Catherine Keener and others. ==Plot== In this politically charged romantic comedy, Jessica Biel stars as Alice Eckle, a small-town waitress in Indiana who suffers a freak accident when a nail gun mishap embeds a nail in her head. Due to her lack of health insurance, she cannot afford the $150,000 surgery required to remove it. The nail causes her to exhibit erratic behavior, including mood swings and impulsive actions. Determined to find a solution, Alice travels to Washington, D.C., to seek help from Congressman Howard Birdwell (Jake Gyllenhaal). As they work together to address healthcare reform, Alice becomes romantically involved with Birdwell. The film satirizes political processes and the healthcare system, featuring a cast of eccentric characters, including a congresswoman (Catherine Keener) more interested in building a lunar military base than addressing medical issues. ==About the director== David O. Russell disowned the movie, then called Nailed, when it was pitched in 2008. In 2015 he announced it would be called Accidental Love and decided that he would be under \"Stephen Greene\", because it was named after Alan Smithee. ==References== Category:2015 comedy movies Category:2015 romantic comedy movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:Movies directed by David O.
