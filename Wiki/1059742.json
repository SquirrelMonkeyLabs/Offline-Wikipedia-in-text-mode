 "text": "The WAGR B class were a total of 10 diesel-hydraulic locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1962 to 1984. The B class were designed by Commonwealth Engineering in Queensland while being assembled at Bassendean entering service from 1962 to 1965. The first few locos were used for shunting at Midland and West Perth. The second group featured slopped cabs in order to operate on Fremantle wharves with low-set cranes. All of the class were withdrawn in 1984. Some have been preserved, such as class leader No. 1601 which is stored at the Bassendean Railway Museum.
