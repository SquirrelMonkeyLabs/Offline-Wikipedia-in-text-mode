 "text": "The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations was the 29th Africa Cup of Nations held from 19 January to 10 February 2013. It was organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). South Africa hosted the tournament for the second time. This was also the first tournament to be held on an odd-numbered year. This was done so that it doesn't get in the way of the FIFA World Cup. Nigeria won the tournament after a 1–0 victory over Burkina Faso in the final. Mali also won the third-place game. Nigeria later represented Africa in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. == Qualification == A total of 47 countries entered the qualification. * * * * * * * * * * * * * (Host) * * * == Venues == The average daytime temperature of the host cities ranges from to .
