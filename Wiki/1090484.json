The adult male frog is 26.4-29.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 32.3-35.4 mm long. This frog can change color. The skin of its back is red-brown during the day and light brown at night. It has small, dark spots, and large brown spots. There is a dark brown mark between the eyes. There are white spots on the sides of the head with a dark brown line around each one. There is also one white spot underneath each eardrum. There are stripes on the tops of the legs. These stripes are gray during the day and dark brown at night. There are white bumps on the legs. There is bright yellow color on parts of the sides, legs, and feet. The toes, belly, and front of the neck are white in color. The webbed skin on all four feet is gray in color. The iris of the eye is red in the middle and yellow on the outside, with a black ring outside that. This frog lives in rainforests on hills. It lives in old rainforests that have never been cut down and in newer rainforests that were cut down and are growing again. It lives in the plants next to streams. When it is time to lay eggs, the male frog climbs to a leaf over the water. The female frog lays her eggs on the leaf. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because even though it only lives in a few places, two of those places are protected parks. Scientists think climate change could kill this frog. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Leptomantis gauni. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
