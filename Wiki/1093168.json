 "text": "Located in the long galley that is a part of Masjid Al-Haram, Safa and Marwa are two small historical hills which are connected to the larger mountains, Abu Qubays and Qaiqan in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Safa and Marwa are an integral part of the religious acts of Hajj and Umrah as Muslim pilgrims are commanded to walk between the two hills in order to commemorate Bibi Hajar’s commitment to her son, Prophet Ismail , in such harsh circumstances and her unwavering devotion to the command of Allah SWT During the Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages, Muslim pilgrims are required to travel back and forth seven times between the mountains of Safa and Marwa. This ritual is commonly known as Sa’ee, linguistically meaning walking, pursuing, or striving. It is a Sunnah to perform Sa’I, and hence every pilgrim should perform the Umrah and Hajj correctly by embarking upon this ritual. Category:Mecca",
