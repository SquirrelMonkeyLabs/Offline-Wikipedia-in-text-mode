Martin Luther King, Jr. and the staff of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference met and decided to launch a Campaign to highlight and find solutions for many problems for the countryâ€™s many poor people. In the Poor Peoples Campaign the leaders recruited workers to help proceed in the campaign and recruit people from ten BIG cities from around the nation. King planned for 2,000 to go to Washington DC to protest for unemployment insurance, jobs, fair minimum wage and education for poor children and adults. ==References== Category:American civil rights",
