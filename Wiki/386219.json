Shakur was arrested for the first time in 1967 for trespassing during a protest. ==Activism== In 1971, Shakur joined the Republic of New Afrika and the Black Liberation Army. She chose the name Assata Olugbala Shakur because she felt that her English name was a \"slave name.\" She wrote in her book, \"It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really had nothing to do with me. I didnâ€™t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. I felt like an African woman\".Shakur, Assata. Assata - an autobiography. London: Zed, 2014. Print. Assata is a West African name from the Arabic name Aisha, which means \"she who struggles.\" Olugbala is from Yoruba and means \"savior.\" As early as 1973, Shakur referred to Joanne Chesimard as her \"slave name\". Shakur means \"thankful one\" in Arabic. ==Arrests and trials== On April 6, 1971, Shakur was shot in the stomach. She was charged with attempted robbery, felonious assault, reckless endangerment, and possession of a deadly weapon, then released on bail. Between 1973 and 1977 Shakur was charged with two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, and attempted murder of two Queens police officers. She was put in prison in 1973. On November 2, 1979 she escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey. ==Political asylum in Cuba== In 1984, the Cuban government granted political asylum to Shakur. Her daughter Kakuya came to live with her in 1985. Shakur wrote in a letter that Cuba was \"one of the largest, most resistant and most courageous Palenques (Maroon Camps) that has ever existed on the face of this planet\". == Related pages == * FBI * Tupac Shakur * List of feminists ==Notes== == References == Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:African- American people Category:American communists Category:American murderers Category:American people convicted of assault Category:American robbers Category:Criminals from New York City Category:People from North Carolina Category:People from Queens Category:Shakur family Terrorism",
