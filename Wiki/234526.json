 "text": "Clapping is when you hit your hands together which makes a sound. The harder you hit, the louder the sound, the softer you hit, less the sound. If hitting by means of hand to hand contact it will make a different sound than if you were to clap against another object, say, your leg. When people clap quickly together, this is called applause.
