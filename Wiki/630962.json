 "text": "On 14 April 2018, beginning at 04:00 Syrian time (UTC+3), the United States, France, and the United Kingdom carried out a series of military strikes, with manned aircraft and ship-based missiles, against multiple government sites in Syria against the Bashar al-Assad regime. The three acting powers did so in response to the use of chemical weapons against people in Douma in eastern Ghouta on 7 April, which they think was done by the Syrian government. Syria denied involvement in the Douma attacks and called the airstrikes a violation of international law. President Donald Trump of the United States, Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom and President Emmanuel Macron of France ordered the strikes. ==References== Category:2018 in Asia Category:2010s explosions in Asia Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2018 Category:2010s in Syria Category:April 2018 events Category:History of Damascus Category:Donald Trump Category:Explosions in 2018",
