 "text": "\"Nice & Slow\" is a song by American singer Usher. It was released as the second single from his second album My Way (1997). It became his first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. Because of this, \"Nice & Slow\" was not a success in that country since his single \"You Make Me Wanna...\" reached number one. It also became the last single from Usher's My Way album. It was written by Brian & Brandon Casey of Jagged Edge, Manuel Seal, Jermaine Dupri, and Usher. The music video for the song featured Kimora Lee Simmons. ==Track listings== UK CD: 1 # \"Nice & Slow\" # \"Nice & Slow\" (CD-Rom Video Element) # \"You Make Me Wanna...\" / \"Just Like Me\" / \"My Way\" (Snippets) US CD:2 # \"Nice & Slow\" (Album Version) # \"Nice & Slow\" (Album Instrumental) UK CD: 2 # \"Nice & Slow\" (Radio Version) # \"Nice & Slow\" (Live Version) # \"Nice & Slow\" (B-Rock's Basement Mix) # \"Nice & Slow\" (Suli & Stef's Club Class Mix - UK Mix) ==Charts== Chart (1998) Peak position ===End of decade charts=== Chart (1990â€“1999) Position U.S. Billboard Hot 100 75 ==References== Category:1997 songs Category:Usher songs",
