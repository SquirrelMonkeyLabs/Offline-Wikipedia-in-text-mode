 "text": "Pop is a UK children's channel that airs many childrenâ€™s cartoons. == History == Pop was called Popfun sometime before 2013, but in July 2022, it changed its name to POP. At first it was just music videos but in early 2023 it started to show cartoons. These include things like Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks, Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir etc.; The music videos were kept but all disappeared in mid 2016. They were brought back in 2017 but only during a slot called Pop Party. Also changes have been made to the logo throughout the years. To start with, it showed letters being replaced by balloons, it was all in lower case, and it had no exclamation mark but in November 2016, a change was made. It was now white letters on an red background. They were in 3D now. The exclamation mark was added and the letters were now all done in upper case. Due to copyright reasons on the music that got changed in 2017. In 2018 Pop's logo yet again changed. It used to be coloured letters on a red background but the background disappeared and the letters were now all light red. This is its current logo but the old one is still on the pop website. == Popfun.co.uk == Not long after the launch of Tiny pop's website, Pop had its own channel launched too. It features a fun and games bit, a what's on bit, a competitions page, and the logo. The games are things like Oggy Moshi, and things like that. == References == Category:British television networks",
