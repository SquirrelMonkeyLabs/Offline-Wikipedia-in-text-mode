 "text": "The sandy big-eyed tree frog (Nyctimystes kubori) is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. It lives in the central mountains and Huon Peninsula, between 1100 and 2000 meters above sea level. There are more sandy big-eyed tree frogs in the wild than any other frog in the genus Nyctimystes. This frog lives in open valleys, forests, and beds of reeds near rivers. The adult male frog can be as big as 45 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female can be as big as 60 mm long. It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw. It is yellow-brown, gray, or dark brown on the back, with darker spots and patches. Its belly is white. Some of the webbing between its toes is bright orange. This frog lays eggs in big blobs about 75 mm in diameter. It hides the eggs under rocks under the water. In the local Kaironk language, this frog is called kwlek. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
