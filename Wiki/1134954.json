Richard Landes made Pallywood popular by his online documentary titled \"Pallywood: According to Palestinian Sources\", which exposed what he considered media manipulation by Palestinians. Journalist Ruthie Blum defines Pallywood as Landes' word for staged scenes by Palestinians in collaboration with Western camera crew, aimed at advertising against Israel under the guise of news. ==References== Category:Neologisms Category:Journalism Category:Disinformation",
