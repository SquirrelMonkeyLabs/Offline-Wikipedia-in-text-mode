 "text": "Wikimedia Incubator is where potential Wikimedia plan wikis in new language versions of Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikinews, Wikiquote and Wiktionary can be set, written, tested and wiki project hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. even though these trial wikis do not yet have their own wiki, they can be used for actual like any additional Wikimedia project wiki. fresh language versions of Wikiversity are supposed to go to Beta Wikiversity, and those of Wikisource to aged Wikisource. You can not create a full new project, you could only start a new language edition of an obtainable project. == References == Category:Wikimedia Category:Wikis",
