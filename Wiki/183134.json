 "text": "Multiple birth is when a singular woman gives birth to more than one child at once. Depending on the number of children born, twins (two), triplets (three), quadruplets (four) are born. There have been women that have given birth to 4 or more children in one go before. In cases where woman gave birth to multiple children, there is a higher risk of mortality (death) for both the mother and baby and also a higher risk of birth defects. The chance of multiple birth increases when artificial insemination is used. It was used in China to \"outsmart\" the one-child policy.
