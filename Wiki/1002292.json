He was created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, and first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #101 in October of 1971. == Fictional character biography == He was a famous biochemist who was suffering from a debilitating blood disease, and injected himself with vampire bat DNA in hopes of curing himself, but became a living vampire. Despite being introduced as an antagonist of a few heroes, in some versions of the universe, he is an anti-hero who has worked with Spider-Man and Blade, and was a member of the Legion of Monsters and the Midnight Sons. == Powers and abilities == He possesses superhuman strength and speed, limited flight and the ability to hypnotize others. He also has a Wolverine-like healing factor that allows him to recover from otherwise fatal wounds. Morbius can sometimes infect his victims with \"pseudo-vampirism,\" though this only happens in rare cases. == In other media == In Spider-Man: The Animated Series, he was voiced by Nick Jameson. In the Sony's Spider-Man Universe, he is portrayed by Jared Leto in the 2022 titular film of the same name. == Source == * Some text was copied from Morbius the Living Vampire at Heroes Wiki, which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license.
