 "text": "The Kolis of Pethapur killed the 50th governor of Gujarat Haider Kuli Khan and his officer Kasam Ali Khan in the battle at Pethapur. In 1739, Kolis of Pethapur attacked on the author of Mirat-I-Ahmadi, Mirza Mahamad Hasan (also known as Ali Mahamad Khan) when he was returning from Sabar Kantha with some security personals and soldiers. In this struggle, Kolis killed the few soldiers of author and wounded the Mirza Mahamad Hasan. The Koli Rebellion of Pethapur in Gujarat is a lesser-known historical episode involving the Koli community, which has had a long history of socio-political and economic struggles. Historically, the Kolis of Gujarat have been recognized as a warrior caste with a significant presence in the region, including involvement in uprisings against rulers and colonial powers. Pethapur, once a princely state under the Vaghela dynasty, was an important location during British rule and earlier periods. The Kolis in this region were involved in various forms of resistance, often due to oppressive taxation, land disputes, or exclusion from socio-political privileges. Specific details about the Koli rebellion in Pethapur, however, remain sparse in mainstream sources, though it reflects the broader historical narrative of Koli uprisings in Gujarat, such as the Navsari and Rajpipla uprisings. == References == Category:18th-century rebellions Category:18th century in India Category:Koli people",
