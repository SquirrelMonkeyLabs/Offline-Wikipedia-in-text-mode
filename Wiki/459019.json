 "text": "Anton Drexler (13 June 1884 â€“ 24 February 1942) was a German nationalist and socialist political leader of the 1920s. He was instrumental in the formation of the pan-German and anti-Semitic German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei - DAP), the antecedent of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei - NSDAP). In 1919 Drexler invited Adolf Hitler to join the party and served as his mentor during his early days in politics. Together with Gottfried Feder they developed the NSDAP 25 points manifesto when the Nazi Party was founded in 1920. In 1921 Hitler took control and in 1923 Drexler left the party. He sometime spoke for the Nazis in the following decade, but retired from active politics. Drexler died in Munich in February 1942 after a lengthy illness due to alcoholism.
