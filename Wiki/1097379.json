People have seen it between 550 and 1300 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== This frog is small. The adult male frog is 21.4 - 24.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 26.8 - 27.3 mm long. The frog's body is flat in shape. Its nose is triangular in shape. The feet have disks on the toes for climbing. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and some webbed skin on the back feet. The skin of the frog's back is see-through dark green in color with some yellow on the legs. There is some see-through light green on the legs. There are brown spots on the sides of the body and bottoms of the back legs. There is a dark brown mark behind and between the eyes. There is light blue color on the skin over the eardrum. The webbed skin is black in color. The iris of the eye is bronze in color with black lines in it. ==Home and threats== This frog lives in rainforests on hills and in low places. The female frog lays eggs on plants over muddy water. The eggs are the almost-white color of cream. They have gel on them to protect them. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to build homes and farms and to get wood to build with. The frogs live in at least one protected park: Pu Hoat Proposed Nature Reserve in Veitnam. Scientists think it could also live in Xuan Lien Nature Reserve in Laos and Pu Huong Nature Reserve in Laos. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
