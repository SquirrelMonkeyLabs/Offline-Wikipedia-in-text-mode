 "text": "A passenger is a term that is used for a person who travels in a vehicle, but not the driver or a person working in the vehicle. There are two common ways in which the term is used: * The first is for persons who ride in cars or vans. The term is used for these type of passengers if they have or have not paid for the ride. * The second is for persons who pay to ride in public transport vehicles such as buses, trains, aircraft, and ships. People who work on the vehicle are crew, not passengers. In most places the company who owns the vehicles and the people who work on them have legal obligations to the passengers riding with them.
