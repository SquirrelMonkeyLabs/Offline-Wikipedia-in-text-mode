 "text": "The Longchuan bubble-nest frog, Longchuan small frog, or Longchuan shrub frog (Raorchestes longchuanensis) is a frog. It lives in China, Myanmar, and Thailand. People have seen it between 1350 and 1600 meters above sea level. This frog lives in river valleys. The adult frogs hide behind leaves, but people have seen them in bushes or next to roads. Some frogs will live near human houses. Scientists do not know whether this frog swims as a tadpole or hatches out of its egg as a small frog. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but human farms and getting wood for fuel can harm or disturb it. China has passed laws to protect this frog. It is against the law for anyone to catch and collect it. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
