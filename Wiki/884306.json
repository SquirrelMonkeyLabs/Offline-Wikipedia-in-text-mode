 "text": "Gargantua and Pantagruel is a connected series of five books written in the sixteenth century by Francois Rabelais. The first book was published around 1532; the fifth was published after death around 1564 and some believe its attribution to Rabelais doubtful. It is the story of two giants, a father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their fun trips, written in a slightly funny, fancy, critical vein.
