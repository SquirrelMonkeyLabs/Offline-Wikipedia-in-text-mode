 "text": "Anomaloglossus tepuyensis is a frog. Scientists found it in Auyantepui, in southern Venezuela. ==Home== This frog leaves in streams in forests that grow on high flat lands. People have also seen it in cracks in the rock far from streams. Scientists saw the frog between 390 and 1850 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog inside Canaima National Park. ==Young== The male frog sits near the stream and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on land. The adult frogs carry the tadpoles to streams, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists do not know how much danger this frog is in. Climate change, fires, and diseases could hurt this frog. Climate change could make fires and times with less rain worse. Also, because this frog lives high in the mountains, climate change could hurt it even more: Scientists do not know if it can climb to colder places if its home becomes too hot. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
