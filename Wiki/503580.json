He is a power forward-center for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was born in Toronto, Ontario and moved to Kamloops, British Columbia when he was in grade 7. ==Career== ===College=== Olynyk played college basketball at Gonzaga University. During his freshman and sophomore years there, Olynyk averaged 12 to 13 minutes per game and was mainly a bench player. During his junior year, Olynyk and Gonzaga both agreed that he would redshirt. He played in the 2012–13 season and was selected for both the Consensus First-Team All-American and the 2012–13 Academic All-America first team. ==NBA== Olynyk was selected 13th overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2013 NBA draft. The same day, the Mavericks traded Olynyk to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Lucas Nogueira and two future second round picks.

During the first quarter of Game 4 of the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Olynyk got tangled with Cleveland Cavaliers player Kevin Love while battling for a loose ball and dislocated Love's left shoulder. Love called it a \"bush-league play\" and Olynyk said that he would \"never intentionally hurt someone.\" The league suspended Olynyk for one game without pay and ruled that he had \"yanked [Love's] arm down\". On September 26, 2022, Olynyk was traded to the Utah Jazz.
