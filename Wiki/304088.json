It is known in connection with The Twelve Labours, in which Heracles, the enemy of Hera, visited all the other sites of the Goddess throughout the world to defeat every monster that nature could imagine, and return the early world to his Olympian father, Zeus, who would be its new master.Ruck and Staples, p. 163. ==References== *Graves, Robert, The Greek Myths 1955. *Kerenyi, Karl, The Heroes of the Greeks 1959. *Carl A.
