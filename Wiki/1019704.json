People have also seen it where Guangdong Province touches Guangxi Province. ==Home== This frog lives in wet forests and bamboo forests. It only lives in forests. People have seen this frog between 200 and 1300 m above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==Young== The male frog sits on a bamboo plant and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs in bamboo plants. The tadpoles swim in rainwater in the bamboo plants. ==Danger== This frog is in some danger because people cut down its forests to make rubber plant farms, banana farms, and areca farms. Bad chemicals can also hurt this frog. People used to cut down the forest where the frog lives to get wood to build with and make things that people need but scientists say this does not kill the frog any more. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
