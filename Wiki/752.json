 "text": "The word supernatural (from ) is used for things that some people believe are real, but that are not part of nature or can’t be explained by the scientific laws of nature. Because we cannot prove whether these things are real, people often disagree about these things. Some say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural, because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real. Other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way, they are real. Some examples of supernatural things or examples are: * Sorcery * miracles * precognition * demonic possession * souls, spirits, ghosts, religion visions, wraiths, shades, poltergeists, ectoplasms, invisible people or apparitional experiences * monsters * yōkai, yūrei or obake * angels or saints * demons, dybbuks or asuras * mōryō * extraterrestrial creatures * legendary creatures * God, gods or kami * Satan, devils or fiends * parapsychology ==Related pages== *Religion *Belief *Spirituality *Superstition *Ritual *Near death experience *Naturalism (philosophy) - the idea that the supernatural does not exist Category:Religion",
