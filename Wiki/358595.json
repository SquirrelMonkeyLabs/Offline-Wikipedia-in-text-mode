 "text": "Nimbaphrynoides is a genus of true toads. They live in the highlands in the Mount Nimba region of the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire. They are Critically Endangered due to habitat loss, and iron and bauxite mining in their small ranges. The two species are viviparous. This means they have internal fertilisation. The female gives birth to fully developed, tiny toadlets.Sandberger, Hillers, Doumbia, Loua, Brede and Rödel (2010).
