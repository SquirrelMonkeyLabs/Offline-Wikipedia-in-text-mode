It is an epistle (letter) written to the Church at Corinth by the Apostle Paul. == The Letter == Paul begins by greeting the people in Corinth and reminding them that he is serving the Lord Jesus Christ. He then spends a lot of time explaining to the people why he is an apostle. Some of the people are mad at him because in 1st Corinthians he told them to stop doing bad things. He explains that he told them to stop because he loved them. He also teaches them that it is very important to forgive others. This epistle is said to show Paul's individuality more than any other.Corinthians, Second Epistle to the, in Easton's Bible Dictionary, 1897 ==References== Category:Pauline epistles Category:New Testament books",
