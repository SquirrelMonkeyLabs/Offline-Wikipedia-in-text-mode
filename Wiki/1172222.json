 "text": "The Battle of Crysler's Farm took place on 11 November 1813, during the War of 1812. During the battle, U.S. Major General James Wilkinson and Brigadier General John Parker Boyd led an attack on Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison and Commander William Mulcaster along the banks of the banks of the St. Lawrence River in Morrisburg, Dundas County, Upper Canada (now Morrisburg, Ontario, Canada). The Americans wanted to try and capture Montreal. The Americans greatly outnumbered the British, Canadian and native forces but still failed. The British won the battle when the Americans suffered heavy losses and retreated. U.S. Brigadier General Leonard Covington was killed in action during the battle. They never attempted to capture Montreal again after. The name of the battle was taken from the location of a farm owned by Captain John Crysler, an officer in the Dundas County Militia. The British, Canadians and natives had an army of 800. The Americans had an army of 8,000, the largest force they used to try and invade British North America. On the British side, there were 31 killed, 148 wounded, and 13 missing. On the American side, there were from 102 killed, 237 wounded, 120 captured, and an unknown amount of people missing. A monument was erected on September 25, 1895 by the Canadian Department of Militia and Defence to honour the fallen British and Canadian soldiers. On January 30, 1920, the Crysler's Farm site was designated as a National Historic Sites of Canada. == References == Category:1813 in North America Category:Battles involving Canada Category:History of Ontario Category:War of 1812",
