 "text": "The Biden Foundation was a non-profit organization from 2017 to 2019. It was founded and opened by then-former Vice President Joe Biden and then-former Second Lady Jill Biden. == Origins and purpose == The Biden's launched the Biden Foundation on February 1, 2017. The purpose of the foundation was to allow them to continue supporting the issues they cared most about once they left Washington D.C. in January 2017. These causes included Joe Biden's Cancer Moonshot initiative, during his term as vice president, and the Violence Against Women Act. Jill Biden's support for military families, which had begun as the Joining Forces initiative during her time as second lady, and her focus on community colleges, where she continued to teach after she left office. == Shutdown == On April 25, 2019, the Biden's announced that they were suspending all operations effectively and immediately and all the foundation's activities to follow. This closing was due to the announcement of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, following the same day. == References == Category:Joe Biden Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States",
