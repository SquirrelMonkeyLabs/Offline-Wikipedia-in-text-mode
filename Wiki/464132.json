 "text": "John \"Jack\" Laviolette (July 17, 1879 â€“ January 9, 1960) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and winger. Laviolette played 9 seasons with the Montreal Canadiens hockey club. During his time with them, he became their first captain, coach, and general manager. He won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens in 1916. He was born in Belleville, Ontario but grew up in Valleyfield, Quebec. When the National Hockey Association (NHA) formed in December 1909, (which was replaced 7 years later by the NHL), team/league owner Ambrose O'Brien asked Laviolette to put together a team made up of French Canadian players and play as the \"Les Canadiens\" franchise in Montreal. Laviolette was able to complete the task in time for the NHA's first season. Some of the first players that were signed to the team were future hall of famers Newsy Lalonde, Didier Pitre and Georges Vezina. The team that he had put together would go on to become the most successful franchise in professional hockey. In 1918, Laviolette lost his right foot in an automobile accident. The accident would end his playing career. There was a benefit game that was held for Laviolette at the Mount Royal Arena in 1921, which Laviolette was the guest of honour and also refereed. In 1960, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as a lacrosse player and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1879 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey coaches Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Ice hockey people from Quebec Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:Sportspeople from Belleville, Ontario Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Montreal Canadiens (NHA) players",
