 "text": "A civil servant or public servant is an employee who works in the civilian career public sector for a government department or agency. Many consider the study of civil service to be a part of the field of public administration. Who is a civil servant and who is not is different in different countries. Workers in non-departmental public bodies, (called Quangos in some countries) may also be called civil servants in context with statistics.
