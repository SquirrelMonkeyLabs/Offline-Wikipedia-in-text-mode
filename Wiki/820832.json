 "text": "704 Hauser is an American situation comedy television program and a spin-off of All in the Family. It was the last spin-off from All in the Family and aired on television from April 11 to May 9, 1994 on CBS. The show is about an African American family moving into Archie Bunker's old house in the 1990s. The show was created by Norman Lear who also made All in the Family. People thought 704 Hauser was not bad but also not very good. But the show was ended early, almost a month after it started. Five episodes were shown on television and the six episode was made but not put on television. In All in the Family Archie Bunker is the conservative parent and his daughter, Gloria Stivic and her husband, Michael Stivic were liberals. In 704 Hauser it is opposite because the parents in the show are liberal and the son in the show is a conservative. ==Cast== * John Amos as Ernie Cumberbatch * Lynnie Godfrey as Rose Cumberbatch * T.E.
