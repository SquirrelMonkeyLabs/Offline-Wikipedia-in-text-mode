 "text": "Great British Railways (GBR) is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee rail transport in Great Britain except for Transport for London, Merseytravel, light rail and tram services. It will take most rail functions of the Department for Transport and Rail Delivery Group, including services and setting fares. In addition, it will absorb Network Rail to become the operator of most rail infrastructure across Great Britain. The powers of the UK's devolved administrations will not be affected. == History == The railways of Great Britain were originally built by private companies, but after the Transport act 1947 it was nationalised and was run by British Railways until the railways become privatised, which begun in 1994 and finished in 1997. The rail infrastructure, passenger and freight services were separated at the time. == Notes == ==References== Category:Rail transport in the United Kingdom",
