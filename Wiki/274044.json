 "text": "Bismuth(III) chloride, also known as bismuth trichloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BiCl3. It has bismuth and chlorine atoms in it. The bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state. ==Properties== Bismuth(III) chloride is a pale yellow solid. It reacts with water to make bismuth oxychloride and hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in acids like hydrochloric acid. It reacts with reducing agents to make bismuth metal. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting bismuth with chlorine. It can also be made by dissolving bismuth(III) oxide in hydrochloric acid. Bismuth can be dissolved in nitric acid to make bismuth(III) nitrate, which reacts with sodium chloride to make bismuth(III) chloride. ==Uses== It is used as a catalyst in organic chemistry. It is a good source of bismuth and is used to make other bismuth compounds. ==Safety== Bismuth(III) chloride can cause burns on skin because it makes hydrochloric acid when it reacts with water. It irritates the gastrointestinal tract. ==Related pages== *Bismuth(III) bromide *Bismuthine Category:Bismuth compounds Category:Chlorides",
