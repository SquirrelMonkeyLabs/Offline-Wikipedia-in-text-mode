 "text": "Unbreakable was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was held on September 11, 2005 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the first and only Unbreakable event that TNA held and was also the ninth event in TNA's 2005 pay-per-view schedule. There were nine matches on the card and two pre-show matches. The main event was a Three Way match between then-champion Christopher Daniels, A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe. Styles ended up winning the match and became the new X Division Champion. Another top card match saw Raven defeat Rhino in a Raven's Rules match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Unbreakable gained positive reviews. The Three Way TNA X Division Championship match earned a rare 5 star rating from Dave Meltzer which was the first that the promotion had received. Corey David Lacroix of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show 8 out of 10, and said \"TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, catering to the variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans.\" ==Matches== # Results Stipulations Times Pre-Show Cassidy Riley fought Jerrelle Clark to a no contest Singles match 1:56 Pre-Show Shark Boy defeated Mikey Batts Singles match 3:20 1 3Live Kru (B.G.
