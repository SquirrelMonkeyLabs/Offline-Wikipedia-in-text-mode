Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian, referring to the Assyrian dialect; Neo, referring to the modern state of the language; Aramaic, referring to the Aramaic language) (Also called Chaldean Neo-Aramaic or Sureth) is a North-western Semitic language that was mostly in use in ancient Assyria (Now part of modern Iraq) that’s been spoken for more than 2,800 years, mostly spoken by the Assyrians, who are adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East, Ancient Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church, Chaldean Catholic Church, and some other denominations. In Iraq, the language is mainly spoken in the Nineveh Plains and the cities around Mosul, Duhok, Ankawa, Aqrah, Mangesh, Tel Keipeh, Baghdeda, Tel Skuf, Baqofah, Batnaya, Bartella, Sirnak-Cizre (Bohtan), Arbil, Kirkuk, Araden, Barwari, Alqosh and many more Iraqi villages in the north with each village where the language is spoken having their own dialect. It is widely disputed as one of the oldest languages spoken in the modern Neo- Aramaic period (911–609 B.C.). The writing system used by most Semitic languages during the modern Neo-Aramaic period was the cuneiform writing system (Clay tablets) which was in use from the beginning and to about 750 B.C. Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, part of the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family, is spoken by approximately 220,000 people in Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and the Assyrian diaspora. It is a vital language for the cultural and religious identity of the Assyrian people. Category:Languages",
