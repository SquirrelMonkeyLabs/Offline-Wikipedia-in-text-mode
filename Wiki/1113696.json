 "text": "Jusant is a puzzle platformer video game. It was both published and developed by Don't Nod. It was released on 31 October 2023 for Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. There is no talking in the game. Instead the story is told through the environment of the game. The player controls a young woman as she trys to climb to the top of an abandoned tower while also avoiding enemies trying to knock her off. ==Reception== The game recieved good reviews by game critics. Critics said that they liked the climbing mechanics, gameplay, environments and sounds. However, they said they didn't like the walking mechanics. Jusant would be nominated in the New Intellectual Property category at the 20th British Academy Games Awards but lost to Viewfinder. Even though, the game recieved praise, the production team would break up after the game had \"failed to meet commercial expectations\". ==References== Category:2023 video games Category:Climbing and mountaineering video games Category:Puzzle- platformers Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Single-player video games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
