These are to share their stories, experiences, and messages telling LGBT youth that their lives will get better over time. The It Gets Better Project shows LGBT youth that they was not alone in their experiences. It shows they have people to turn to for support. The project was created by Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller in 2004. It includes submissions by US President Barack Obama and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ==References== ==Other websites== * It Gets Better Project * Hillary Clinton: Tomorrow Will Be Better, YouTube * Barack Obama: It Gets Better, YouTube Category:LGBT Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States",
