 "text": "The Game Boy Printer is an accessory for the Game Boy line of video game consoles. It was released in Japan, North America, and Europe in 1998. It allows a person to print pictures taken with the Game Boy Camera. It can also be used to print images from Game Boy and Game Boy Color games that can be used with it. It uses thermal paper, which is a kind of paper that changes color in heat. It runs on six AA batteries. It can be used with all Game Boy Consoles except for the Game Boy Micro. Like the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, Nintendo stopped making the Game Boy Printer in 2003. Category:Nintendo hardware Category:Printers Category:Game Boy",
