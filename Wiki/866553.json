Baxley reopened the cold case of the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. In a letter, the Ku Klux Klan threatened him, comparing him to John F. Kennedy, and called him an \"honorary nigger.\" Baxley responded, on official state letterhead: \"My response to your letter of February 19, 1976, isâ€”kiss my ass.\" ==References== Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Lieutenant Governors of Alabama Category:Lawyers from Alabama Category:District attorneys Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians",
