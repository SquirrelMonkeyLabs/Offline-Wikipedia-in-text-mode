 "text": "Roundup is the brand name for a systemic and broad-spectrum glyphosate based herbicide. It is produced under the Bayer company. It was previously produced under Monsanto. Bayer, in 2018, took over Monsanto. Roundup was first developed and patented during the 1970s. It was first marketed to consumers in 1973. As of 2009, sales for Roundup herbicides were still about 10% of Monsanto's revenue. However, Chinese makers of similar herbicides competed with Roundup. The product is marketed to consumers under the Scotts Miracle- Gro Company. There is limited evidence saying human cancer risk could increase due to exposure to large amounts of glyphosate. There is almost no good evidence for such a risk though. ==References== Category:Herbicides",
