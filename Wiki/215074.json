 "text": "The assassination (murder) of Julius Caesar was the result of a conspiracy by forty Roman senators, the self-styled Liberatores. They were led by Cassius and Brutus. == Attack and death == The senators stabbed Caesar to death in the Theatre of Pompey on the Ides of March, 15 March 44 BC. Caesar was the dictator of the Roman Republic at the time. He had been declared dictator perpetuo (dictator for life) by the Senate. This declaration resulted in many senators fearing that Caesar wanted to overthrow the Senate in favour of a tyranny. The assassination led to civil war. The Second Triumvirate led to the ascendancy of Caesar's adopted heir Octavian to the position of emperor, and the end of the Republic leading to the Roman Empire. In the end, by murdering Caesar, the Liberators caused the end of the Republic they supported. == List of conspirators == The known members of the plot were: *Gaius Cassius Longinus *Marcus Junius Brutus *Servius Sulpicius Galba *Quintus Ligarius *Lucius Minucius Basilus *Servilius Casca *Gaius Servilius Casca (Servilius Casca's brother) *Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus *Tillius Cimber *Caius Trebonius *Caecilius *Bucolianus (Caecilius' brother) *Rubrius Ruga *Marcus Spurius *Sextius Naso *Minucius Basilus *Pontius Aquila Category:44 BC Category:Ancient Rome Julius Caesar Category:March events",
