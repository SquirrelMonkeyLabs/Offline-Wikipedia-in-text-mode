 "text": "The Mass in B minor (BWV 232) (usually called Hohe Messe in German) is a large composition by Johann Sebastian Bach for choir, orchestra and vocal soloists. The words are in Latin and Greek (first movement only). They are the traditional words of the Mass. Bach did not plan the Mass in B minor as one continuous work. Parts of it were composed in 1724. He put the movements together just before his death. It is one of the greatest musical works ever written. == Other websites == * Mass in B minor: performance by the Netherlands Bach Society (video and background information) Category:Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach Category:Choral compositions Category:Masses (music)",
