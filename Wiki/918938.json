 "text": "The Amazonian milk frog (Trachycephalus macrotis) is a frog that lives in Peru and Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 225 and 925 meters above sea level. ==Body== The adult male frog is 6.98 to 91.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 93.9 to 118.7 mm long. It has bronze-colored skin with coffee-colored marks. It has small disks on all its toes for climbing. ==Other frogs== Scientists used to think this was the same frog as T. typhonius, but they changed their minds. ==Home== This frog is awake at night. It lives in forests that are not too high up in the hills. It lives in forests that have never been cut down, near streams. But it can also live near farms, roads, and towns. People have seen this frog between 225 and 925 meters above sea level. ==Young== This frog has many young at once after it rains. Scientists call it an \"explosive breeder\" because of this. The male sits in a large body of water that dries up part of the year. He calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs that float on the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles swim and grow in the water. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is not danger of dying out because it lives in a large place and because it is good at living in places that human beings have changed. But it is in some danger because people cut down trees to make farms and get wood to build with. People also catch T. typhonius to sell as a pet. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Yasuní, Reserva de Producción de Fauna Cuyabeno, Reserva Ecológica Manglares Churute, Reserva Biológica Jatun Sacha, and Estación de Biodiversidad Tiputini. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
