Human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down trees to collect wood for building and to make towns, farms, and places for animals to eat grass. Droughts and floods can kill this frog. Chemicals meant to kill pests can kill this frog by accident. So can fertilizers and pollution. Diseases and ultraviolet light can kill this frog. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog. ==Name== The scientific name of this frog melacaena comes from two Greek language words meaning \"black\" and \"thorn or spine.\" The scientists named it after the black spike on the male frogs' thumbs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
