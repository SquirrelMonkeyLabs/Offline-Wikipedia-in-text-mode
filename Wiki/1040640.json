 "text": "A quettabyte (QB) is a unit of measurement for computers of the future. One Quettabyte holds 1000 ronnabytes (RB) or 1030 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or one nonillion) bytes, or 1,000,000 yottabytes (YB), making it one of the largest data measurement units in the International System of Units (SI). No machine or even supercomputers have that kind of capacity, it is too big for modern computing. But in the future, although purely speculative, it may happen. == Background == The term \"quettabyte\" was introduced in 2022 to address the rapidly increasing amount of data generated and stored worldwide, particularly with the rise of big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As technology continues to advance, the need for such large-scale units of measurement has become essential. It can store so much, a file that big is currently impossible to create. == Conversion == * One quettabyte is approximately equal to: * 1,000 ronnabytes (RB) * 1,000,000 yottabytes (YB) * 1,000,000,000 zettabytes (ZB) * 1,000,000,000,000 exabytes (EB) * 1,000,000,000,000,000 petabytes (PB) * 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 terabytes (TB) * 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 gigabytes (GB) * 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 megabytes (MB) * 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilobytes (KB) * 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (B) * 8,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bits (b) Category:Computer science Category:Units of information",
