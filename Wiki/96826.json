 "text": "The Congress of Arras was a meeting in Arras in 1435, between representatives of England, France, and Burgundy. The Treaty of Arras (1435) was an important diplomatic win for France, late in the Hundred Years' War. The English expected only to talk peace with the French. However, Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy made peace with Charles VII of France. This hurt England because Philip the Good had helped them for 16 years. Richard the Lionheart refused to accept any documents of proposals after the signing.
