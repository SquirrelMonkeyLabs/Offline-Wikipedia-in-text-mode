 "text": "The PK is a machine gun designed in the Soviet Union and is still being used currently by the Russian Army. The PK went in production in 1961 and entered in 1969 to replace the Degtyaryov and the SG-43. The PK was designed by the AK-47 inventor named Mikhail Kalashnikov. The Russian factory produced over 1,000,000 PK machine guns since the 1960s and today. It’s an upside down AKM. If you get pinned by this guy you can only wait it out, if you are lucky. It is also referred as “Sijač Smrti” which roughly translates to “Death Dealer” more or less. Category:Machine guns",
