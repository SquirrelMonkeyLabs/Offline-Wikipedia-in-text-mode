 "text": "WWE Hell in a Cell was a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event made by WWE. The first event took place in 2009, replacing No Mercy in the early October slot of WWE's PPV calendar. In 2012, WWE announced that Hell in a Cell would move to late October, leaving only one pay-per-view in October. the 2018 event was held in September, while the 2021 and 2022 event were held in June. The show's concept was based on WWE's well- known Hell in a Cell match, in which wrestlers fought inside a 20-foot (6-metre) high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. Each main event match of the card was contested as a Hell in a Cell match. \"Hell in a Cell\" was chosen over \"No Escape\", \"Locked Up\" and \"Rage in a Cage\". Since it began, the event has been held only in indoor arenas in the United States. Championship matches happened on every card. Under the brand extension, WWE assigned its performers to either Raw or SmackDown, which caused matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show (except for the 2011â€“2015 events, since there was no brand split then). The 2022 event was the last Hell in a Cell event produced, as it was replaced by Night of Champions in 2023. However, in 2024, WWE brought back the Bad Blood event, which featured the Hell in a Cell match as the main event. ==Concept== In this PPV, all main events were fought as Hell in a Cell matches, in which the ring and ringside area were surrounded by a 20-foot high roofed cell structure. This type of match had no disqualifications or countouts, and the escape rule from steel cage matches also did not apply. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission inside the ring. ==Dates and venues== Raw-branded event SmackDown- branded event # Event Date City Venue Main Event Ref. 1 Hell in a Cell (2009) October 4, 2009 Newark, New Jersey Prudential Center D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels and Triple H) vs. The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) in a Tornado tag team Hell in a Cell match 2 Hell in a Cell (2010) October 3, 2010 Dallas, Texas American Airlines Center Kane (c) vs. The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship 3 Hell in a Cell (2011) October 2, 2011 New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans Arena John Cena (c) vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. CM Punk in a Triple threat Hell in a Cell match for the WWE Championship 4 Hell in a Cell (2012) October 28, 2012 Atlanta, Georgia Philips Arena CM Punk (c) vs. Ryback in a Hell in a Cell match for the WWE Championship 5 Hell in a Cell (2013) October 27, 2013 Miami, Florida American Airlines Arena Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton in a Hell in a Cell match for the vacant WWE Championship with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee 6 Hell in a Cell (2014) October 26, 2014 Dallas, Texas American Airlines Center Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins in a Hell in a Cell match 7 Hell in a Cell (2015) October 25, 2015 Los Angeles, California Staples Center Brock Lesnar vs. The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match 8 Hell in a Cell (2016) October 30, 2016 Boston, Massachusetts TD Garden Sasha Banks (c) vs. Charlotte Flair in the first ever women's Hell in a Cell match for the WWE Raw Women's Championship 9 Hell in a Cell (2017) October 8, 2017 Detroit, Michigan Little Caesars Arena Kevin Owens vs. Shane McMahon in a Falls Count Anywhere Hell in a Cell match 10 Hell in a Cell (2018) September 16, 2018 San Antonio, Texas AT&T; Center Roman Reigns (c) vs. Braun Strowman in a Hell in a Cell match for the WWE Universal Championship with Mick Foley as the special guest referee. 11 Hell in a Cell (2019) October 6, 2019 Sacramento, California Golden 1 Center Seth Rollins (c) vs. \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt in a Hell in a Cell match for the WWE Universal Championship 12 Hell in a Cell (2020) October 25, 2020 Orlando, Florida WWE ThunderDome at Amway Center Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Randy Orton in a Hell in a Cell match for the WWE Championship 13 Hell in a Cell (2021) June 20, 2021 Tampa, Florida WWE ThunderDome at Yuengling Center Bobby Lashley (c) vs. Drew McIntyre in a Last Chance Hell in a Cell match for the WWE Championship 14 Hell in a Cell (2022) June 5, 2022 Rosemont, Illinois Allstate Arena Cody Rhodes vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins in a Hell in a Cell match ==Related pages== *List of WWE pay-per-view events *WWE Bad Blood ==References== This article is based on WWE Hell in a Cell on the English Wikipedia. ==Other websites== *Hell in a Cell website *Pro Wrestling Events website Category:World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view events Category:2009 establishments",
