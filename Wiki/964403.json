 "text": "Savatage was an American heavy metal band. It was made by Jon Oliva and Criss Oliva in Florida in 1979. The band's first name was Avatar, but they changed it before they released their first album. This was because another band was already named Avatar. Savatage is thought to have had a big influence on heavy metal. Many think they had an effect in making progressive metal and death metal sound different. == Albums == * 1983: Sirens * 1985: Power of the Night * 1986: Fight for the Rock * 1987: Hall of the Mountain King * 1989: Gutter Ballet * 1991: Streets- A Rock Opera * 1993: Edge of Thorns * 1994: Handful of Rain * 1995: Dead Winter Dead * 1997: The Wake of Magellan * 2001: Poets and Madmen == References == Category:Heavy metal bands",
