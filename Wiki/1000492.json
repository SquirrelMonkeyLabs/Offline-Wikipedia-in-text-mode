It went to number 1 in Canada and Ireland and went to the top ten in Finland, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland and the United Kingdom. ==Formats and track listings== These remixes by Brothers in Rhythm originated as bootlegs on 12\" vinyl. They use the live Rotterdam performance featured on the \"Please\" single rather than the album version. U2 approved it for limited promotional use to coincide with the release of The Best of 1990-2000. == References == Category:1997 songs Category:U2 songs Category:Alternative rock songs",
