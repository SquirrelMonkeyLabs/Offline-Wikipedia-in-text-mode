 "text": "The Wea were a Miami-Illinois-speaking Native American tribe. They were in western Indiana. They were related to the Miami Tribe. The name Wea is used today as the a shortened version of their many recorded names. The Wea name for themselves in their own language is waayaahtanwa. This came from waayaahtanonki, 'place of the whirlpool', where they were first recorded being seen and where they were living at that time.Costa, David J. 2000. \"Miami- Illinois Tribe Names\", In John Nichols, ed., Papers of the Thirty-first Algonquian Conference 30-53.
