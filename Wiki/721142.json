The service offered online play, and, until Monday March 27th, 2023, also offered the Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U. Until June 2020, if you linked the Nintendo Network ID with your Nintendo Account, you could also use the service to log into the Nintendo Account system used by the Nintendo Switch and the My Nintendo rewards program.
