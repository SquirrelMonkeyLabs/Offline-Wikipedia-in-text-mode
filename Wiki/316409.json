This church was destroyed by a tornado in 1916. The Spanish Lieutenant-Governor Carlos de Hault de Lassus appointed Daniel Boone commandant of the Femme Osage District, which he served until the United States government bought the area in the Louisiana Purchase in 1804. The name of the town, San Carlos, was anglicized (turned into English) to become St. Charles. ===State capital and growth=== Missouri became a US state in 1821. The government decided to build a new state capital, the \"City of Jefferson\", in the center of the state on the Missouri River.
