 "text": "Energy drinks are beverages whose producers say they can \"can boost energy\". This claim has to do with vitamins and stimulants in these drinks. Examples of energy drinks are Red Bull and Monster Energy. They are usually well liked by young people. 66% of energy drink sales are to people between the ages of 14 and 35. Up to a third of children in the UK have at least one energy drink every week. They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which includes bars and gels; they are also different from sports drinks, which are advertised to improve sports performance. There are many brands and varieties in this drink category. Energy drinks have the effects of caffeine and sugar, but there is little or no evidence that many other ingredients have any effect. Most effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Other studies ascribe those performance improvements to the effects of the combined ingredients. There is evidence that these drinks are harmful to the mental and physical health of children and young people, as well as their behaviour and education. Some supermarkets have introduced a voluntary ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-16s. The British government said they would ban energy drinks for under-16s in England in 2019, but in 2024 that has not happened. The British Soft Drinks Association says their voluntary code of practice says BSDA members do not market or promote energy drinks to under-16s. ==References==",
