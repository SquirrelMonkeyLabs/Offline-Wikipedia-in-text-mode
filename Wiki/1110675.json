 "text": "The Ranipuram leaping frog or Tyson's leaping frog (Indirana yadera) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains, south of the Palghat Gap in Kerala. ==Body== This species of frog can be any of three different colors. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. People have seen the frog on moss on rocks and dead leaves on the ground, near houses and on arecanut farms. People have seen this frog between 826 and 1123 meters above sea level. ==Young== Sometimes the male frog stays to watch the eggs. This frog's tadpoles do not live in the water and instead move across wet rocks and moss using their tails and their back legs. Their back legs grow on them sooner than other tadpoles' back legs. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out. They say chemicals meant to kill pests can kill this frog. Sometimes people hit this frog with cars or trucks. People also take away the dead leaves and rocks that the frog needs. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog. They think it could change the weather that the frog needs to lay eggs. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Indirana, but they do not know how much danger the frog is in from the fungus. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
