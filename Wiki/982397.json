Folmer was sentenced to death and imprisoned in, among others, the , the prison in Utrecht, and Herzogenbusch concentration camp. Her execution was prevented by the evacuation of the camp on Dolle Dinsdag. As a Nacht und Nebel prisoner, she went to multiple German prisons. Because she was moved so often, her death sentence papers were never at the prison she was. She was liberated in Waldheim by the Russians on 6 May 1945. Her return journey to the Netherlands is described in the book 'The Walls Came Tumbling Down' by Jet Roosenburg. After the war, she and Nel Lind organized reunions in which British and Canadian air force veterans traveled the escape routes from the Netherlands to the Swiss or Spanish borders.
