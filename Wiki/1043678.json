 "text": "A gunship (not to be confused with a gunboat) is a military aircraft armed with heavy aircraft guns, primarily intended for attacking ground targets either as airstrike or as close air support. In modern usage the term \"gunship\" refers to fixed-wing aircraft having laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. The term \"gunship\" originated in the mid-19th century as a synonym for gunboat and also referred to the heavily armed ironclad steamships used during the American Civil War. The term helicopter gunship is commonly used to describe armed helicopters. ==World War II aviation== ===Attack aircraft=== During World War II, the urgent need for hard-hitting attack aircraft led to the development of the heavily armed gunship versions of the North American B-25 Mitchell. ==Postâ€“World War II aviation== ===Fixed-wing aircraft=== In the more modern, post-World War II fixed-wing aircraft category, a gunship is an aircraft having laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. The Douglas AC-47 Spooky was the first notable modern gunship. ===Helicopter gunships=== ==References== Category:Military aircraft",
