 "text": "Samson was a British heavy metal band between 1977 and 2002. It was considered a part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Its first album, Survivors, received good reviews. This made the band more popular. Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickinson was in the band before he joined Iron Maiden. Dickinson went by the name \"Bruce Bruce\" while he was in Samson. The band kept making music until 2002, when guitarist Paul Samson, who started the band, died of cancer. == Studio albums == * Survivors (1979) * Head On (1980) * Shock Tactics (1981) * Before the Storm (1982) * Don't Get Mad, Get Even (1984) * Joint Forces (1986) * Refugee (1990) * Samson (1993) * P.S....
