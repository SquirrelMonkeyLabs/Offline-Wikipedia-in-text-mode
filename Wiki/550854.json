 "text": "Branching is a term in linguistics. It refers to the way a phrase or sentence is made up. There is a head word and various other words to make the phrase or sentence. ==Examples== Most languages make phrases with a head word and dependents (modifiers). These examples show the phrase heads in bold. Examples of left-branching phrases (= head-final phrases): ::the house \\- Noun phrase (NP) ::very happy \\- Adjective phrase (AP) ::too slowly \\- Adverb phrase (AdvP) Examples of right-branching phrases (= head-initial phrases): ::laugh loudly \\- Verb phrase (VP) ::with luck \\- Prepositional phrase (PP) ::that it happened \\- Subordinator phrase (SP = subordinate clause) Example of phrases that contain both left- and right-branching (= head-medial phrases): ::the house there \\- Noun phrase (NP) ::very happy with it \\- Adjective phrase (AP) ::only laugh loudly \\- Verb phrase (VP) Most structures in English are, however, not completely left- or completely right-branching, but rather they combine both. The following trees show a combination of left- and right- branching in English: ::: There are more right-branching structures than left- branching structures in English. This means that trees usually grow down to the right. Category:Linguistics",
