 "text": "An election happened to elect a Senator from the U.S. state of Georgia. There were two rounds on November 3, 2020; and January 5, 2021. The two people in last round of the election were Jon Ossoff (Democratic Party) and David Perdue (Republican Party). Primary elections happened on June 9, 2020. The Republican Party primary only had one person, David Perdue, as he was Senator before the election. There were many people in the Democratic Party primary, and Jon Oscoff won. These went against Libertarian Party candidate Shane T. Hazel. Nobody got more than 50% of the vote, so the top two (Oscoff and Perdue) went to a second round in January. Ossoff won the second round and became Senator. ==Democratic Party primary== ==Republican Party primary== ==Results== ===First round=== ===Second round=== ==References== Category:2020 United States Senate elections Category:2020 in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:2021 elections in the United States Category:2021 in Georgia (U.S. state)",
