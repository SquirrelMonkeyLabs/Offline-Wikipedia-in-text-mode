 "text": "The Yingjiang ridge-nosed tree frog or Yingjiang tree-hole frog (Nasutixalus yingjiangensis) is a frog. It lives in Tibet, in China. People have seen it 1610 meters above sea level. This frog lives high in the trees where the branches come together like a roof. Scientists think this frog is in danger of dying out because it has only been found in a small place: 129 square kilometers. However, scientists think it could live in other places too, but humans have cut the trees down to get wood to build with. Scientists think human beings changing wetlands could hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
