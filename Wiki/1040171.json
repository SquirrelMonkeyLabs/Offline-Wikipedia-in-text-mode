 "text": "The Greit bush frog or Munnar common bush frog (Raorchestes griet) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen this frog in one place: a valley in the Western Ghat mountains, about 1500 meters above sea level. People have seen it between 600 and 2000 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in forests on mountains. Some of the forests had been cut down and were growing back. People have seen the frog near shola forests and on tea farms. Scientists believe this frog needs woody plants smaller than tall trees to live. The adult male frog is about 20.7-22.1 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They never swim as tadpoles. There are fewer of this frog than there were in 1999. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of dying. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. This frog lives in trees and humans cut down the trees to make farms for tea and eucalyptus. People have seen the frogs on some of the eucalyptus trees, but scientists do not think the frogs can live there the way some other frogs can live on farms. Scientists say the biggest problem for this frog is cutting down trees but human beings also bother the frog. Many people take a religious trip to the forests where the frog lives. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can make other frogs in Raorchestes sick, so scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might kill this frog. Scientists also think climate change could kill this frog. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Eravikulam National Park, Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary, Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Periyar Tiger Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
