 "text": "Asian Dust (also yellow dust, yellow sand, yellow wind, or China dust storms) is a weather occurrence that happens each year. It affects much of East Asia during the spring. The dust comes from deserts in Mongolia, northern China, and Kazakhstan. The dust comes from surface winds and dust storms in the desert. The wind carries the clouds eastward to China, Japan, Eastern Siberia, and the Koreas. Smaller particles in the clouds can travel much farther to places like the United States. In the last ten years, these dust storms have become a serious problem because they have picked up industrial pollutants. ==Other websites== * Asian Dust in Korea * Ostapuk, Paul Asian Dust Clouds * Szykman, Jim et al.Impact of April 2001 Asian Dust Event on Particulate Matter Concentrations in the United States * Kwon Ho-Jang et al.Effects of the Asian Dust Events on Daily Mortality in Seoul, Korea * Carbon Monoxide Measurements in the Mongolian Desert Dust Cloud at Boulder * The Bibliography of Aeolian Research Category:Weather events",
