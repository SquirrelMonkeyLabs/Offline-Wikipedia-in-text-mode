Joan Jett who is a long time fan of The Gits wrote a song entitled \"Go Home\" which was inspired by the death of Mia Zapata. The band's original name was \"Snivelling Little Rat Faced Gits\" which was named after a Monty Python skit but they later shortened it to The Gits. ==Discography== * Frenching the Bully (C/Z Records) (1992). ** (Reissued on Broken Rekids), (2003) * Enter: The Conquering Chicken (C/Z Records) (1993). ** (Reissued on Broken Rekids), (2003) * Kings & Queens (Broken Rekids) (1996) * Seafish Louisville (Broken Rekids) (2000) * Best of The Gits (Liberation) (2008) == Other websites == *The Gits Official Site *The Gits Site (Spanish) Category:American punk bands Category:Musical groups from Seattle Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1993 Category:1986 establishments in the United States Category:1993 disestablishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Washington (state) Category:1990s disestablishments in Washington (state)",
