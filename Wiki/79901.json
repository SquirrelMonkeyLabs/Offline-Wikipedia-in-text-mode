 "text": "Popcorn is a snack food made by heating certain kinds of corn. There is a small amount of water inside the seeds, which causes them to explode. When the seed shell breaks a sharp noise is made. The name \"pop\" is because of this noise. After it pops it is white and fluffy. Salt and melted butter are often added to popcorn. Sometimes caramel and other flavors are melted and mixed into the popcorn. Popcorn is a popular food to eat at the cinema. == Kernel choking == Many accidents of choking on popcorn kernels were reported. This is because the popcorn kernel does go into the airway and throat, and gets stuck. Many people want other people to take kernels out of the popcorn for children. == References == *Who Invented Microwave Popcorn? *How was Popcorn Discovered?
