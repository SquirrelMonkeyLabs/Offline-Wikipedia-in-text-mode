 "text": "The New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars is a list of stars, nebulae and galaxies. It is abbreviated NGC, and is sometimes called just New General Catalogue. It has 7,840 objects on it. These objects are called \"NGC objects\". It was created by John Louis Emil Dreyer in 1888. Like the older, smaller Messier catalog, it is a famous deep-sky catalogue for amateur astronomy. Most of observations were rewarded by William Herschel and his son, and expanded by the known catalogue Index Catalogues I and II, adding about 5000 new objects. South Hemisphere objects are less studied than North Hemisphere objects, observed by John Herschel. The New General Catalogue had some mistakes, that were corrected in a special revised edition: RNGC ==NGC 2000.0== It's a copy of NGC objects using J2000.0 coordenates created in 1988 ==References== ==Other websites== * The Interactive NGC Catalog online Category:Astronomical catalogues",
