 "text": "Caucasoid was a word for a person from Europe, West Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, North Africa, or the Horn of Africa. The group of these persons was called \"Caucasoid race\" or Caucasian race.The Races of Europe by Carlton Stevens Coon. From Chapter XI: The Mediterranean World - Introduction: \"This third racial zone stretches from Spain across the Straits of Gibraltar to Morocco, and thence along the southern Mediterranean shores into Arabia, East Africa, Mesopotamia, and the Persian highlands; and across Afghanistan into India.\" In former times, many people divided human beings into three races. These races were called Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong.Templeton, A. (2016). EVOLUTION AND NOTIONS OF HUMAN RACE. In Losos J. & Lenski R. (Eds.), How Evolution Shapes Our Lives: Essays on Biology and Society (pp. 346-361). Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press. . That this view reflects the consenus among American anthropologists is stated in: German anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752 â€“ 1840) invented the name Caucasian race because he saw a connection to the Caucasus Mountains. In the United States, white people are often called \"Caucasian\". But the actual \"Caucasian race\" included people with a skin from white to brown. ==References== Category:Scientific racism",
