He destroyed many buildings with a custom bulldozer in Granby, Colorado on June 4, 2004. Heemeyer had feuded with Granby officials. This was happend over many fines for violating city health ordinances when he dumped sewage due to zoning disputes with neighbor. His feud came to a head on June 4, 2004. Over about 18 months Heemeyer had secretly created a CAT D355A bulldozer by adding layers of steel and concrete, intended to serve as armor. He used this to demolish the Granby town hall, the former mayor's house, and several other buildings. Heemeyer's rampage ended with his suicide, after his bulldozer became trapped in the basement of a hardware store he had been in the process of destroying. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Suicides by firearm in the United States Category:American criminals Category:People from Colorado Category:People from South Dakota Category:Criminals who committed suicide",
