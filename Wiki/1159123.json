 "text": "Neoclassical metal is a type of Heavy metal music that mixes classical music with metal, featuring complex and technical playing. It includes elements from both classical music and speed metal. Yngwie Malmsteen became one of the most famous musicians in this style, helping to shape it in the 1980s. Other well- known musicians in this genre include Randy Rhoads, Luca Turilli, Michael Romeo, Jason Becker, Vinnie Moore, Alexi Laiho, Jani Liimatainen, Kiko Loureiro, Uli Jon Roth, Stéphan Forté, Wolf Hoffmann, Timo Tolkki, Luke Fortini, Syu, and Marty Friedman. Although it’s mostly known for guitarists, keyboard players like Jens Johansson, Michael Pinnella, Alex Staropoli, and Janne Wirman also play in this style. == History == In the 1960s and 1970s, works like Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra and bands like Rainbow helped shape neoclassical metal. Early classical influences in hard rock and metal were seen in the playing of musicians like Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, and Randy Rhoads. However, it wasn’t until the 1980s that neoclassical metal became its own style. The 1980s saw rapid growth in guitar techniques, with the rise of \"shredding\" playing a big role in popularizing neoclassical metal. This period marked the \"golden age\" of the genre, with many guitarists focusing on complex, instrumental music. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, often considered the creator and leader of neoclassical metal, signed with Mike Varney's Shrapnel Records in 1982. Other notable musicians like Tony MacAlpine, Vinnie Moore, and Marty Friedman also rose to prominence in the late 1980s, helping define the genre.",
