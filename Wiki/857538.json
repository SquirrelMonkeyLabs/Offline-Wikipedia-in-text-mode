He would be arrested in Bhawalpur, Pakistan as he was involved with the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot in August 2006, a day before some other arrests were made in the United Kingdom. The Pakistani Interior Minister, Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao, thought that he was definitely someone who worked for al Qaeda. He was thought to be one of the leaders of the plot. In December 2006, the anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi said that they couldn't find any proof that showed he had been involved in helping terrorists, but was charged with some smaller charges. Rauf was born in England with people originally from Pakistan as his parents, and was in Birmingham during his childhood. Rauf was married to someone in the family of Maulana Masood Azhar.\"JeM chief's father questioned about Rauf\", NDTV, 18 August 2006.
