 "text": "Stitch! The Movie is a direct-to-video animated spin-off of Lilo & Stitch, released on August 26, 2003. Although it follows the original movie, it is often considered more of a pilot for the spinoff series Lilo & Stitch: The Series. The movie introduces Jumba's 625 experiments. Without the credits, the movie is only 57 minutes long. == The story == Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley are all living with Lilo and Nani. But no one knows that Jumba had secretly deactivated all 625 of his other experiments and brought them with him. The ex-captain Gantu, hired by Jumba's former partner, Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel, goes to find them and captures Jumba to force him into telling where they are. Now, Lilo and Stitch have to save Stitch's ohana from being used for chaos. Two experiments are activated in this movie: 221, \"Sparky\", with the ability to cause big electric surges, and 625 who has all the abilities of Stitch but is lazier. At least he makes good sandwiches! == Production == The movie's original title was going to be Lilo & Stitch: A New Ohana. At some time, there was a decision to only have Stitch's name in the names of both the movie and the following series, which was planned to be called Stitch! The Series. Eventually, this was changed, making this movie and the series have different names. The Stitch! name, with the exclamation point, was later used as the name of an anime series five years after this movie's release. == Cast == * Daveigh Chase: Lilo * Chris Sanders: Stitch * Paul Winchell: Stitch (roaring) * Tia Carrere: Nani * David Ogden Stiers: Dr. Jumba Jookiba * Kevin McDonald: Agent Pleakley * Ving Rhames: Cobra Bubbles * Dee Bradley Baker: David Kawena * Kevin Michael Richardson: Captain Gantu * Jeff Bennett: Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel, a rat-like alien. * Zoe Caldwell: Grand Councilwoman * Kunewa Mook: Hula Teacher * Liliana Mumy: Mertle Edmonds * Rob Paulsen: Experiment 625/Reuben, gopher-like creature * Frank Welker: Experiment 221/Sparky/Stitch (growling) ==Related pages== * Lilo & Stitch * Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch * Leroy & Stitch ==Other websites== * * Category:2003 movies Category:2003 animated movies Category:Disney animated movies Category:Disney direct-to-video movies Category:Direct-to-video movies Category:American family movies Category:Lilo & Stitch Category:Sequel movies",
