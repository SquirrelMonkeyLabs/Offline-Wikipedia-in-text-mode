 "text": "The Rouen Cathedral series of oil paintings of the Rouen Cathedral were done by Claude Monet in the 1890s. The paintings in the series each capture the front of the cathedral at different times of the day and year. They each show the changes in the way the cathedral looks under different lighting conditions. In the middle of winter in 1892, Monet lived in rooms across from Rouen Cathedral. He stayed until spring, painting its façade many times. Most versions were painted as seen here: close up and cropped at the sides. He returned the next winter to paint the cathedral again. He made more than thirty views of it. It was not the Gothic façade that was Monet's subject. It was the atmosphere that surrounded the cathedral. \"To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor,\" Monet said, \"What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me.\" All of the paintings in the series were made in 1892 and 1893. They were reworked in Monet's studio in 1894. In 1895, he chose what he considered to be the twenty best paintings from the series, and displayed them at his gallery in Paris. Of these twenty, he sold eight before the exhibition was over. Pissarro and Cézanne visited the exhibition and praised the series highly. ==Gallery== Image:Claude Monet 032.jpg|The portal and the tower of the saint-romain at morning sun, Harmony in Blue 1893 Musée d'Orsay Paris, France Image:Claude Monet - Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Morning effect).JPG|Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Morning effect) 1892-1894 Folkwang Museum Essen, Germany Image:Claude Monet - Rouen Cathedral, Facade I.jpg|Rouen Cathedral, Facade 1 1892-1894 Pola Museum of Art Hakone, Japan Image:Claude Monet La cathédrale de Rouen, le portail.jpg|Rouen Cathedral, The Façade in Sunlight 1894 Clark Art Institute Williamstown, USA Image:Rouen Cathedral, West Facade.JPG|Rouen Cathedral, West Facade, 1894, National Gallery of Art Image:Claude Monet - Rouen Cathedral, West Facade, Sunlight.jpg|Rouen Cathedral, West Facade, Sunlight, 1894, National Gallery of Art Image:Rouen Cathedral- Setting Sun, Symphony in Grey and Pink.jpg|Rouen Cathedral- Setting Sun, (Symphony in Grey and Pink), 1894, National Museum Cardiff, Great Britain Image:Monet-cathedrale-rouen.jpg|Rouen Cathedral, Facade and the Tour d'Albane.
