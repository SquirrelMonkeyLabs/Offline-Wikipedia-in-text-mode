 "text": "In geology, a fracture is any kind of separation or break in a rock formation. Examples are joints or faults. These divides the rock into two or more pieces.Gudmundsson, Agust (2011) Rock Fractures in Geological Processes Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, A fracture can sometimes form a deep, wide crack in the rock. They are usually caused when the rock is not strong enough to hold up under too much stress. This makes the rock crack along its weakest point.Park, R. G. (2005) Foundation of Structural Geology (reprint of the 1997 Chapman and Hall edition) Routledge, Abingdon, England,page 9, Fractures can provide access for fluids, like water or hydrocarbons, to move into the rock. ==References== Category:Geology",
