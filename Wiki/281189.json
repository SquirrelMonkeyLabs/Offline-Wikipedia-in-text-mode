 "text": "The Pirc defence is one of the asymmetrical hypermodern defences, usually to 1.e4. It is similar to the Modern defence, but reserves the decision as to whether to fianchetto the g8 bishop. Because it is so flexible it lends itself to transpositions. This is one of the main lines: :1.e4 d6 :2.d4 Nf6 :3.Nc3 g6 :4.f4 Bg7 :5.Nf3 0-0 :6.Bd3 Na6 :7.0-0 c5 A completely different idea is: :1.e4 d6 :2.d4 Nf6 :3.Nc3 Nbd7 :4.Nf3 e5 which is a transposition into Philidor's defence. Another idea is: :1.d4 d6 :2.Nf3 Bg4 which is called Wade's defence. Category:Chess openings",
