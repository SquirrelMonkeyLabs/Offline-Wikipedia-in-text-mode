 "text": "Sorella Epstein () was a Latvian-born girl who was arrested, detained, and subsequently murdered by the Germans, alongside her mother Rosa and three other unidentified women in Liepaja, Liepāja, Kurzeme, Latvia, then annexed by Germany. Sorella and her mother were murdered by the Germans because they were Jewish, which was most likely the same case with the three other unidentified women shot and murdered alongside them. Sorella, her mother Rosa, and the three other unidentified women, were humiliated and silenced, forced to take off most of their clothing, despite the fact that it was December, then were forced to pose for a quick photograph, then they were forced to get inside a pit, along with approximately 3800 Jews in the same area, and were then shot and murdered. The bodies of Sorella, her mother Rosa, her father Jakob, and most likely even the bodies of the three other unidentified women, along with the bodies of thousands of other Jews, were buried in the Liepaja Memorial Wall in Liepaja, Liepāja, Kurzeme, Latvia. == Biography == Sorella Epstein was born on in Liepaja, Liēpaja, Kurzeme, Latvia. Sorella's parents were Jakob Epstein (1892–1941) and his spouse (wife) Rosa Epstein (1898–1941). Sorella Epstein and her family were Latvian-born Jews. Once the Germans invaded, occupied, and then annexed Latvia, they began to persecute, arrest, detain and murder the Jews there almost immediately. On 1 July 1941, Sorella's father Jakob Epstein died in Oswięcim, Powiat oświecimski, Małopolskie, Poland, which was too annexed by Germany, after he was sent there. Sorella and her mother Rosa, were arrested and detained by the Germans, because they were Jewish, (the three other unidentified women arrested and detained with Sorella and her mother Rosa may have been probably Jewish, too) and were sent to captivity in prison. On 15 December, Sorella, her mother Rosa, and the three other unidentified women, were taken out of prison and were taken out onto the city beach, to be shot and murdered. There, they were humiliated and silenced, then forced to undress, then forced to pose for a quick photograph, then forced to get inside a pit, and while in the pit they were subsequently shot and murdered, along with approximately 3800 other Jews of the city. The photograph shows Sorella Epstein, with her face being hidden behind her mother Rosa's dress, her mother Rosa, and three other unidentified women. Sorella and her mother Rosa were humiliated, silenced, and murdered because they were Jewish, along with approximately 3000 other Jews of the city. The bodies of Sorella, her mother Rosa, her father Jakob, and most likely the bodies of the three other unidentified women, along with the approximately 3000 other Jews, were all buried in Liepaja Memorial Wall in Liepaja, Lipeāja, Kurzeme, Latvia, and their bodies are still being kept and buried there currently to this day.
