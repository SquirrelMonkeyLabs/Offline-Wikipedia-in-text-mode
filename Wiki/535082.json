 "text": "A mass grave is a grave where several bodies are buried together, without coffins. Some mass graves have just a few bodies. Others are created when hundreds or thousands of people die in mass murders, disease epidemics, genocides, or natural disasters. ==Definitions== Not everybody defines \"mass grave\" the same way. Some sources say a mass grave just needs to contain \"more than one\" person. According to the United Nations, a mass grave has three or more people buried together. Another definition simply says that \"a large\" number of bodies are buried together in a mass grave. Other definitions have said that mass graves are: * Graves where bodies were buried with no respect for each individual person * Graves where bodies are buried very closely together, packed tightly, without the dignity of a regular burial * Group graves of people who were killed or executed without a trial, or without doing anything wrong ==Disease== For centuries, humans have used mass graves when large numbers of people died at once from disease epidemics. In these cases, the goal of the mass grave is not to disrespect the bodies of the dead. The goal is to prevent disease from spreading from the dead to the living. Also, if too many people have died, it may be impossible to bury them all separately. === The Black Death === Also see: The Black Death Historians have found mass graves in Europe with victims of the Black Death (a very deadly 14th-century pandemic). At the time, people were terrified of catching the plague from dead bodies. Often they buried plague victims in mass graves. Sometimes, people still tried to honor the dead with Christian burial traditions. Daniel Defoe, who lived during the Great Plague of London in 1655-1666, wrote about one mass grave: ==Disasters== More recently, victims of natural disasters have been buried in mass graves. Like with mass graves for disease victims, mass graves for disaster victims are not meant to disrespect the dead. In disasters where many people die, it may not be possible to bury each person one by one. === 2010 Haiti earthquake === For example, after 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were tens of thousands of bodies in the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince. In the first nine days after the earthquake, about 90,000 people were buried in mass graves, using bulldozers. There were so many bodies that there was no space, and not enough workers, to bury them one by one. One Haitian man, who helped bury 2,500 people in three mass graves, said: \"You have to understand that it's completely un-Haitian to dump bodies like this. We have extreme respect for the dead. And these people deserve a decent burial.\" Later, he and other volunteers put up crosses to mark the graves, put holy water on the graves, and had a priest say prayers for the dead. === 2011 earthquake === Some areas in Japan had to use mass graves after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Usually in Japan, people are cremated after they die. However, there were too many victims, and not enough kerosene to cremate them or dry ice to keep the bodies from decomposing. In one town, cremating all the town's victims would have taken 100 days. Because of this, some towns had to use mass graves to bury the dead. ==Murder and genocide== Throughout history, people and governments that have murdered many people have buried them in mass graves. Unlike mass graves for disease or disaster victims, this type of mass grave is often meant to disrespect the bodies of the dead after they are murdered. Mass graves have been found from many of the international wars and civil wars in modern history. Here are a few examples. ===World War I=== During World War I, on July 19, 1916, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were killed in a battle with the German Army. In 2008, about 250 of their bodies were found in mass graves, where the Germans had buried them. ===World War II=== ====The Holocaust==== During The Holocaust, Nazi Germany killed six million Jewish people and millions of other people. Nobody knows exactly how many of these people are buried in mass graves. However, here are some examples of mass graves from Nazi murders: * At the Babi Yar massacre in Ukraine, Nazi soldiers killed 33,771 Jewish people in two days, and buried them in a mass grave. * At the Rumbula massacre in Latvia, Nazis killed about 25,000 Jews in two days, and buried them in mass graves * At some of the Nazi concentration camps, like Buchenwald and Treblinka, the Nazis buried thousands of people in mass graves * At the Nazis' death camps, they cremated the people they killed and dumped their ashes together. For example, at Treblinka, a layer of human ashes 20 feet deep covered parts of the ground. At Auschwitz's death camp, people's ashes were thrown into fields, swamps, and ponds. These areas might be thought of as mass graves too. ====Soldiers' graves==== During World War II, German soldiers who died when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union were buried in mass graves in Eastern Europe. In 2013, the German War Graves Commission moved 70,000 soldiers from these mass graves to a cemetery in Russia. This was the 82nd cemetery the Commission had built to re-bury soldiers buried in mass graves. All together, the 82 cemeteries hold more than 800,000 German soldiers. The Commission says there are at least 250,000 more German soldiers buried in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union also used mass graves during World War II. For example, in the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, they buried almost 500,000 civilians and soldiers in 186 mass graves. These people had died or been killed during the Siege of Leningrad. ===The Soviet Union=== In the Soviet Union, as many as 20 million people may have died or been murdered while Joseph Stalin ruled the government. Most of them were Soviet civilians. Many were buried in mass graves. The biggest include: *Bykivnia (between 100,000 and 225,000 people are buried here)\"Ukraine reburies 2,000 victims of Stalin's rule\". Reuters. Thomson Reuters. October 27, 2007.

They buried many of these people in mass graves. In 2007, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Committee found four mass graves, with more than 400 people in them. The Committee estimates that there are about 150 mass graves in South Korea. ===The Vietnam War=== During the Vietnam War, in the Huế Massacre, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army murdered between 2,800 and 6,000 civilians and prisoners of war. They buried the bodies in dozens of mass graves.Anderson, David L. (2004). The Columbia Guide to the Vietnam War. Columbia University Press. pp. 98-99. ===Genocide in Cambodia=== From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge, ruled by Pol Pot, controlled Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge committed a genocide against the Cambodian people. Historians and scientists say that there are at least 20,000 mass grave sites in the country, holding at least 1,386,734 victims of execution.\"Mapping Project: 1995 to Present\" .

In 2003, specialists found a mass grave that was \"as big as a tennis court.\" It included victims of the Srebrenica genocide. By 2006, 42 mass graves had been found around Srebrenica, and specialists think there are at least 22 more. Another 2,070 victims have been found in the graves.Weinberg, Bill (July 11, 2006).\"Srebrenica: 11 years later, still no justice\". World War 4 Report. Retrieved March 12, 2016. === Other wars === During the Kosovo War (1998-1999), Serbian soldiers committed many war crimes against the Albanian people. As of 2010, six mass graves had been found in Serbia with Albanian victims inside. The largest had between 705 and 1,000 bodies in it. The Colombian government says that in its civil war, which is still going on today, its enemies have buried at least 6,000 people in mass graves. The terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has buried victims in mass graves. As of 2017, more than 3,000 ISIS victims are buried in these graves across Iraq and Syria, according to the International Commission on Missing Persons. In 2016, CNN wrote about a mass grave containing more than 130 men, women, and children who refused to join ISIS. == Mass graves at residential institutions == === Mother and baby homes === * : In 2010, the bodies of 222 infants from Bethany Home, were found in a mass unmarked grave in Dublin. * === Canadian residential schools === == List of mass burials by location == Date of deaths Event Cause of deaths Location Then in Coordinates Longitude 1921 Tulsa race massacre Pogrom , Oklahoma -095° 59′ 11″ 1967-06-08 Six Day War +032° 42′ 20″ El Arish massacre +033° 48′ 12″ 1967-06-??
