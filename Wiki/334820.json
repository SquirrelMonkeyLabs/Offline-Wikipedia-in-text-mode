It was originally rated NC-17 by the MPAA as a result of strong graphic violence, although it was edited downwards and released with an R rating. The theme of Saw centers on the desire to stay alive, appreciation for life, kidnapping, imprisonment and torture. It was followed by eight sequels and a spin-off titled Spiral. It follows the story of Adam (Whannell) and Dr. Gordon (Elwes) as the subjects of a serial killer's latest game, taking place in a dirty bathroom. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:2004 horror movies Category:2004 crime movies Category:2000s psychological movies Category:2004 thriller movies Category:American horror movies Category:American psychological movies Category:American thriller movies Category:English-language movies Category:Saw movies Category:American independent movies Category:Lionsgate movies",
