 "text": "The second season of Family Guy aired on Fox from September 26, 1999 to May 21, 2000. This season has 21 episodes. The season premiered with the episode \"Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater\" and concluded with \"Fore, Father\". Family Guy was cancelled after the second season because it did not have good ratings. However, the Fox network let it come back with a third season returned. After the second season ended, Fox cancelled the show again. After it was cancelled, Family Guy later got high ratings on FOX's Network and had a large number of DVD sales. This made the Fox network ask for more episodes to be made in 2004. Critics of television gave positive reviews of the season. One critic on DVD Talk thought it was \"witty\" and \"hilarious\" and said Family Guy was \"unfortunately\" cancelled. All of the episodes from the first and second season were put on DVD for Region 1 on April 15, 2003. == Episodes == == References == Category:Family Guy Category:1999 television seasons Category:2000 television seasons",
