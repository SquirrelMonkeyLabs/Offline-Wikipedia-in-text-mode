 "text": "The Human eye is a spherical structure that helps us to see the objects .The human eye is an organ that reacts to light in many circumstances. As a conscious sense organ the human eye allows vision; rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision, including color differentiation and the perception of depth.The eye receives oxygen through the aqueous. Its function is to nourish the cornea, iris, and lens by carrying nutrients, it removes waste products excreted from the lens, and maintain intraocular pressure and thus maintains the shape of the eye. This gives the eye its shape. It must be clear to function properly. the front part (what you see in the mirror) includes: * Iris: the colored part. * Cornea: a clear dome over the iris. * Pupil: the black circular opening in the iris that lets light in. * Sclera: the white of your eye. * Conjunctiva: a thin layer of tissue that covers the entire front of your eye, except for the cornea. How does the human eye actually work ? The lens focuses light through the vitreous humor, a clear gel-like substance that fills the back of the eye and supports the retina. The retina receives the image that the cornea focuses through the eye's internal lens and transforms this image into electrical impulses that are carried by the optic nerve to the brain.",
