 "text": "Ballance is a 2004 puzzle game set in outerspace. It costs $5 on Steam and is available for Microsoft Windows. Balance was developed by German studio Cyparade, published by Atari Europe, and first released in Europe on 2 April 2004. The gameplay is similar to Marble Madness, the player controls the ball while trying to avoid falling off the level. == Gameplay == The player controls a ball and must guide it throughout the game's 13 levels. The ball can be turned into a wood, stone, or paper, changing its weight, making it different to control. There are two powerups, Granting extra points or an extra ball. There are checkpoints in every level so that if a player falls, they only have to restart the game from the last checkpoint reached. == References == == Other websites == * Cyparade * Ballance Developer Homepage â€“ from web.archive.org *",
