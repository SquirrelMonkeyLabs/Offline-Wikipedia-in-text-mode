 "text": "Zalzala Koh or Zalzala Jazeera, meaning \"Earthquake Island\", is a small island off the coast of the port city of Gwadar, Balochistan in south east of Pakistan. The island appeared on 24 September 2013, following an earthquake. It is believed to have been made by a mud volcano, where gas pushed up soil and mud from under the sea. The round island is about 15 m high and between 70 m and 90 m across. Gas is still escaping from cracks in the surface. Scientists believe that the island will not last for very long. Within months the level of the island had dropped by more than two metres, and it appears to be sinking backing into the sea. ==References== Category:Islands of Pakistan Category:Balochistan (Pakistan) Category:2013 in Asia",
