 "text": "Vertigo Comics (also known as DC Vertigo or simply Vertigo) was an imprint of DC Comics that began publication in 1993. Spearheaded by editor Karen Berger, all DC Comics titles bearing the Vertigo logo catered to not only more mature readers, but more sophisticated writers and artists as well. Several of DC's existing titles such as Animal Man (Volume 1); Doom Patrol (Volume 2); Hellblazer (Volume 1); Sandman (Volume 2); Shade, the Changing Man (Volume 2); and Swamp Thing (Volume 2) immigrated to the Vertigo camp while fresh new titles and limited series were likewise added to the growing Vertigo roster. Collected versions of many Pre-Vertigo titles now bear the Vertigo stamp even though they were originally published under the standard DC Comics banner. Category:DC Comics",
