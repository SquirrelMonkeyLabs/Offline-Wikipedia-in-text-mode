The use of the phrases \"Love Your Journey\", \"Life is best at 315°\", and \"315°\" on its own are prevalent throughout their designs. == History == Originally founded in 2017 under the name Cloud 9 Expressions. The company did business as PNW Journey under Cloud 9 Expressions, LLC from 2018 until 2020 when the name was officially registered as PNW Journey, LLC. Founding members included siblings Joe Buchmann, Garrett Busch, and Carissa Busch, along with spouses Brianna Buchmann and Kurshell Busch and family friends Chad Misterek and Steve Lindberg. In 2018, Steve left the company to focus on his career in the cannabis industry. In 2019, it was decided to remove spouses Brianna and Kurshell, as well as sister Carissa from the LLC to avoid convolution of the company ownership structure, leaving just Joe, Garrett, and Chad as the company's only owners. At this time, the partnership was also structured to include Joe as CEO with majority ownership, Garrett as CMO and Chad as CFO with equal ownership. == Philanthropy == In March 2020, PNW Journey began a campaign to support No Kid Hungry during the COVID-19 crisis. Over a period of two months, they produced four designs which were printed on t-shirts and hoodies where some of the proceeds were donated to No Kid Hungry. With a total goal of $5,000, they donated $5 from each shirt and $8 from each hoodie. As of May 12th, 2020 they were at $4,176 in total donation money.
