Ang Mo Kio station is the only above-ground and non-interchange MRT station to have a middle train track. The middle track can be used during track/train faults, and certain train services that start from Marina South Pier MRT Station or Jurong East MRT Station end here. The station opened on 7 November 1987, and will become an interchange station with the Cross Island MRT line when the first part, or stage, of the line opens in 2029. == History == The station was opened on 7 November 1987, and was one of the five stations that together were the first MRT stations to open. Nitcharee Peneakchansak, a 14-year-old Thai, was badly injured and lost both her legs after she fell onto the track and was hit by a train at the station on 3 April 2011. On 25 January 2019, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced that the first stage of the Cross Island Line will open in 2029, with Ang Mo Kio being one of the stations along the line. ==Related pages== *Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1987 establishments in Singapore Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations",
