 "text": "Cats is a 2019 movie based on the Broadway musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The movie is directed by Tom Hooper—in his second feature film following Les Misérables (2012)—from a screenplay by Lee Hall and Hooper. It stars James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward. Cats was theatrically released in the United Kingdom and the United States in December 2019, by Universal Pictures. The movie had poor reviews from critics, with many calling it one of the worst movies ever made. The movie also became a box-office bomb, making $74 million on a budget as high as $100 million. ==Musical pieces== * \"Overture\"/\"Prologue: Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats\" – Orchestra/Company * \"The Naming of Cats\"/\"The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball\"† – Munkustrap, Mr. Mistoffelees & Company * \"Jennyanydots: The Old Gumbie Cat\" – Jennyanydots, Munkustrap & Company * \"The Rum Tum Tugger\" – Rum Tum Tugger, Jennyanydots & Company * \"Grizabella: The Glamour Cat\"† – Grizabella, Cassandra, Demeter & Company * \"Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town\" – Bustopher, Rum Tum Tugger, Maitre D' & Company * \"Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer\" – Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer & Victoria * \"Growltiger's Last Stand\"† – Growltiger * \"Old Deuteronomy\" – Munkustrap, Old Deuteronomy & Company * \"The Jellicle Ball\"† – Company * \"Memory (Prelude)\"/\"Beautiful Ghosts\" – Grizabella & Victoria * \"The Moments of Happiness\"† – Old Deuteronomy * \"Gus: The Theatre Cat\" – Gus * \"Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat\" – Skimbleshanks, Munkustrap & Company * \"Macavity: The Mystery Cat\" – Bombalurina, Macavity, Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone & Company * \"Mr. Mistoffelees\" – Mistoffelees, Munkustrap & Company * \"Memory\" – Grizabella & Victoria * \"Beautiful Ghosts (Reprise)\"† – Victoria & Old Deuteronomy * \"The Journey to the Heaviside Layer\"† – Company * \"Finale: The Ad-Dressing of Cats\" – Old Deuteronomy & Company == Related pages == Cats (1998 movie), an older production based on the same story which got much better reviews. == Notes == † denotes songs absent from the soundtrack. == References == Category:2019 musical movies Category:American musical movies Category:British musical movies",
