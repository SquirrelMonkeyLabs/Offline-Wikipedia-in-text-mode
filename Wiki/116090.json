 "text": "EastLink is a tollway (meaning people have to pay to drive on it) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was opened on June 28, 2008. It links the Frankston Freeway to the Eastern Freeway, and includes two tunnels, the Mullum Mullum tunnel and the Melba tunnel. The interchange with the Monash Freeway, the largest in Victoria, is known as the Tom Wills interchange. This was announced on February 27, 2008. This particular interchange was chosen because it was within a short distance from Waverely Park, and the home of the Hawthorn Football Club. Tolls are paid by either a bill sent in the mail, buying a pass from a shop or creating an account and using an electronic Breeze tag or another tollways type of electronic tag in the car to keep track of tolls. The cost of the tolls is charged against the owner's account. == Exits and intersections == EastLink Northbound exits Distance from Eastern Freeway (km) Distance from Frankston Freeway (km) Southbound exits End EastLink continues as Eastern Freeway to Melbourne 0 45 Start EastLink from Eastern Freeway Greensborough Grimshaw St Donvale Springvale Road Donvale Springvale Road MELBA TUNNEL -- -- MULLUM-MULLUM TUNNEL Ringwood Ringwood Bypass 5 40 Ringwood Ringwood Bypass Ringwood Whitehorse Road Ringwood Whitehorse Road BELGRAVE / LILYDALE RAIL LINE BELGRAVE / LILYDALE RAIL LINE Ringwood Canterbury Road 7 38 Ringwood Canterbury Road Wantirna Boronia Road 9 36 Wantirna Boronia Road Wantirna Burwood Highway 11 34 Wantirna Burwood Highway Wantirna South High Street Road 13 32 Wantirna South High Street Road Scoresby Ferntree Gully Road 16 29 Scoresby Ferntree Gully Road Rowville Wellington Road 18 27 Rowville Wellington Road no exit -- 25 Mulgrave Police Road Dandenong North Monash Freeway (Tom Willis Interchange) 21 24 Dandenong North Monash Freeway (Tom Willis Interchange) Noble Park Princes Highway 23 22 Noble Park Princes Highway GIPPSLAND RAIL LINE 25 20 GIPPSLAND RAIL LINE no exit -- 19 Keysborough Cheltenham Road Keysborough Dandenong Bypass 28 17 Keysborough Dandenong Bypass Keysborough Greens Road 30 15 Keysborough Greens Road Carrum Downs Thompsons Road 39 6 Carrum Downs Thompsons Road Greensborough Grimshaw Street 45 0 Carrum Downs Rutherford Road Start EastLink continues from Frankston Freeway End EastLink continues as Frankston Freeway to Frankston ==References== Roads",
