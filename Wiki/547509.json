Six other officers and a civilian were also injured. Earlier in the week, two black men were killed by police: one in Louisiana, another in Minnesota. In Dallas on July 7, people protested against police brutality. The protest was not violent. But just before 9 p.m. (Central time) while the protest was ending, Micah Xavier Johnson began shooting police officers. A suspicious package was found near the area. President Barack Obama spoke against the attacks, saying the shootings were a \"vicious, calculated, despicable attack\" and a \"tremendous tragedy.\" ==References== Category:2016 in Texas Category:2016 murders in the United States Category:2010s crimes in Texas Category:2016 mass shootings in the United States Category:21st century in Dallas Category:July 2016 events Category:Law enforcement in the United States Category:Mass murder in 2016 Category:Mass murder in Texas Category:Mass shootings in Texas Category:Murders by firearm in Texas",
