His writings were based on his own experiences. However, in some cases, we do not know if some of what he wrote was true or poetic hyperbole. In his life, he wrote about 1,200 short stories. Most of his short prose is found throughout many different magazines and newspapers. Almost all of his stories have been found and printed into books.
