 "text": "The Nexus is a series of Android smartphones and tablets produced by Google in co-operation with some phone-making companies. The purpose of the Nexus phones and tablets is to offer a \"pure Android experience\", in which the phones or tablets come free of carrier or manufacturer modifications and with an unlockable bootloader to allow for further development and end-user modification. Nexus phones and tablets were once considered the \"flagship\" Android devices. The Nexus line was later replaced with the Google Pixel. Phones in the series: *Nexus One *Nexus S *Galaxy Nexus *Nexus 4 *Nexus 5 *Nexus 6 *Nexus 5X *Nexus 6P Tablets in the series: *Nexus 7 *Nexus 9 *Nexus 10 The series also had a media streaming device known as the Nexus Q, however it was never officially released because it didn't have enough features to make it worth using. ==Related pages== * Rooting (Android OS) ==References== ==Other websites== * Google.com/nexus * Using Hardware Devices to develop Android applications *",
