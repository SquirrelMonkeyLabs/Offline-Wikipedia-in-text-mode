 "text": "Rudolf Anderson Jr. (September 15, 1927 â€“ October 27, 1962), was a pilot and commissioned officer in the United States Air Force. Rudolf Anderson Jr. was the only person killed by enemy fire during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Anderson died when his U-2 spy aircraft was shot down over Cuba. On October 27, Anderson took off in a U-2F (AF Serial Number 56-6676, former CIA Article 343) from a forward operating location at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. A few hours into his mission, he was shot down by a Soviet-supplied S-75 Dvina (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile near Banes, Cuba. \"The loss of the U-2 over Banes was probably caused by intercept by an SA-2 from the Banes site, or pilot hypoxia, with the former appearing more likely on the basis of present information,\" stated a CIA document dated 0200 hrs, October 28, 1962. Anderson was killed when shrapnel from the exploding proximity warhead punctured his pressure suit, causing it to decompress at high altitude.
