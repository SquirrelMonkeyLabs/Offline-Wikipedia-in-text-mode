 "text": "Wester Ross is part of the Scottish county of Ross and Cromarty. It is in the northwest highlands. It has some of the most spectacular scenery in Great Britain, and is a tourist attraction. Wester Ross is geographically the western watershed of Ross-shire. Administrative and political boundaries have been changed a number of times. The mountains are made of a very old Precambrian rock known as the Torridonian sandstone formation. It was laid down in the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic eras.The Neoproterozoic runs from 1000 million years ago to 550 mya. It is just a small part of what was once a huge supercontinent. The remains of this are in parts of Scandinavia and North America. These rocks are of Archaean and Paleoproterozoic age, ranging from 3.0–1.7 billion years (Ga) ago. == Gallery == Shieldaig from the Applecross road.jpg|Shieldaig, viewed from the road to Applecross Sgurr fiona.jpg|Sgurr Fiona and the Corrag Bhuidhe pinnacles on An Teallach Horns of Alligin.jpg|View east from Sgurr Mhòr over the \"Horns\" Liathach from Beinn Eighe.jpg|Liathach seen from Beinn Eighe.
