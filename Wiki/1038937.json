 "text": "Sarina Petronella Wiegman ( born 26 October 1969), is a football manager and used to be a player from the Netherlands. She's also known as Sarina Wiegman- Glotzbach. Right now, she's in charge of the England women's national team, and she started doing this in September 2021. When she played football, she started as a central midfielder and later played in defence. In 1989, she went to the University of North Carolina and played for their women's soccer team. When she came back to the Netherlands, she played for a team called Ter Leede and even won some championships there. She also represented the Netherlands in football from 1987 to 2001. She played 104 times for her country, but officially recognized games were a little less because some games were against teams that weren't part of FIFA. She was the head coach of the Dutch national team and led them to win the UEFA Women's Euro in 2017. In 2019, they were runners-up in the FIFA Women's World Cup. In 2020, it was announced that she would become the coach of the England women's national team after Phil Neville's contract ended. She stayed with the Netherlands for the Olympics in 2021 but they didn't win a medal. Then, she started coaching the England team and led them to win the UEFA Women's Euro in 2022. This was a big deal because it was the first time England won a big tournament since the men's team won the World Cup in 1966. == References == Category:Living people Category:1969 births Category:Dutch footballers Category:Dutch football managers",
