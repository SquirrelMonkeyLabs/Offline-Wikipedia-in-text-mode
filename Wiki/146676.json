 "text": "WWE Tribute to the Troops is a professional wrestling event held every year since 2003 by WWE and Armed Forces Entertainment in December around Christmas and Hanukkah. The shows are made to honor the United States military. The event features wrestlers from WWE competing in matches against each other and are free for any troop member to visit. From its first show in 2003 until the 2009 edition, Tribute to the Troops took place on open fields in Iraq and Afghanistan as special episodes of SmackDown or Raw. Along the travel, wrestlers and employees stopped at autograph sessions and local hospitals to visit those who fight and may have been injured in war. Since 2010, Tribute to the Troops is held in the United States. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Bethesda Naval Hospital were among the hospitals visited by WWE's employees. In 2004, USO of Metropolitan Washington awarded the WWE the first Legacy of Hope award for their extensive support of their troops and the USOâ€™s Operation Care Package program. In 2006, WWE received the Secretary of Defense Exceptional Public Service award. It was presented to WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon and other wrestlers.When he got the award, McMahon gave it to wrestler, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), noting that Tribute to the Troops was his original idea. WWE also got recognition from General Casey, the Commander of Multinational Forces Iraq. The WWE generally stayed for three days. Overall, 21 events have taken place since 2003. They air December every year, as they are intended to be a holiday treat for the troops (excluding the 2021 edition, which was held in October and aired in November). Not every WWE wrestler and employee attends them, but any wrestler willing to go may attend. The shows feature wrestlers from all brands. == Dates and Venues == No. Date Airdate Venue Location Notes 1 Camp Victory Baghdad, Iraq This was a special episode of SmackDown. 2 Camp Speicher Tikrit, Iraq 3 Bagram Air Base Bagram, Afghanistan This was a special episode of Raw. 4 Camp Victory Baghdad, Iraq 5 Camp Speicher Tikrit, Iraq 6 Camp Victory Baghdad, Iraq 7 Holt Memorial Stadium (Balad Air Base) Balad, Iraq 8 Fort Hood Killeen, Texas 9 Norfolk Scope Norfolk, Virginia 10 Crown Coliseum Fayetteville, North Carolina 11 Joint Base Lewis-McChord Tacoma, Washington 12 Columbus Civic Center Columbus, Georgia 13 Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena Jacksonville, Florida 14 Verizon Center Washington, D.C. 15 Naval Base San Diego San Diego, California 16 Fort Hood Killeen, Texas 17 N/A Marine Corps Air Station New River Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune Jacksonville, North Carolina This was a non-televised event. 18 Amway Center Orlando, Florida 19 Toyota Arena Ontario, California 20 Gainbridge Fieldhouse Indianapolis, Indiana 21 Amica Mutual Pavilion Providence, Rhode Island This was a live special episode of SmackDown. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:World Wrestling Entertainment television programs",
