 "text": "The loudness war is a negative term that describes the apparent competition to release albums that are increasingly loud. Albums that are \"victims of the loudness war\" have worse sound quality because the dynamic range has been compressed to make the music louder. Examples of albums that are victims of the loudness war include Death Magnetic by Metallica. Record producer Charles Dye started an organization called Turn Me Up! that campaigns to give musicians the choice to make albums with bigger dynamic ranges. In March 2010, mastering engineer Ian Shepherd organised the first Dynamic Range Day. ==References== Category:Music technology",
