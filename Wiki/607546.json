It features the Taroko Gorge. The park is well known because it has beautiful mountains and cliffs. ==History== The meaning of \"Taroko\" is magnificent or beautiful in the Truku language. The area in and around the park was created by the Liwu River. The river slowly cut through the rock to create the gorge. The Atayal and the Sedek tribes came to the area over 300 years ago. Researchers found more than 70 villages from the tribes. There was a trail to Taroko called the Northern Road. The Qing Dynasty helped improve it. The Japanese then built a road system along the coast. Gold mining began in the area in the 17th century. It happened when the Dutch ruled Taiwan, during the Qing Dynasty, and when the Japanese ruled Taiwan. When the Japanese ruled Taiwan, they began mining the gold in the Liwu River. It began in 1918. There were plans to mine more gold in a shorter time, but World War II started and it didn't happen. Soon, when the Kuomintang ruled over Taiwan, they banned gold mining. The park was first created in 1937 when Taiwan was ruled by the Japanese. When they created it, it was called Tsugitaka-Taroko National Park. When the Chinese government came back to Taiwan in 1945, they closed down the national park. In the 1950s, Chiang Kai-shek wanted a road that crossed Taiwan from west to east. In 1960, this road was opened, called the Central Cross-Island Highway. It runs through the Taroko Gorge. The park was created again in 1986. It was important because it showed that the Taiwanese government knew that they were damaging the environment. ==Geography== The park has many rivers, waterfalls, and gorges. It has of cliffs.
