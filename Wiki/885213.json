The movie is based on the life of Chiefess Kapi'olani of Hawai'i. ==Plot== Kapi’olani was a young woman of Hawaiian royalty. In 1821, American missionaries taught her Christianity. Over time, she accepts it. The local religion had a tradition. The goddess Pe’le required a human sacrifice. One of the Americans, Hiram Bingham, offered himself in place of a local. Noting Bingham's faith and courage, Kapi’olani decided to prove her faith in her new religion. To do so, she defied local tradition. She walked to Pe’le's volcano at Kilauea. She said a Christian prayer. Then she walked down into the volcano's main vent. She did not die. She became a powerful leader. She converts her people to Christianity. Kapi’olani was one of the first Hawaiians to learn to read and write. She was the first Hawaiian to build a church. ==Credits== ===Cast=== Teuira Shanti Napa as Kapi’olani Mira Sorvino as Mary Thornton Ricky Sua’ava as Alika Kalawaia John Savage as Henry Thornton Michael Camp as Hiram Bingham Malia Marquez as Kanoa Palakiko === Director === Timothy A.
