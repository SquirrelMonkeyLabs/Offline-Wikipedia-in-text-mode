 "text": "Hugo is a 2011 American 3D adventure drama movie that is based on Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. The movie is about a boy who lives alone in a Paris railway station and the owner of a toy shop there. It was directed by Martin Scorsese, while the screenwriter was John Logan. It is a co-production of Graham King's GK Films and Johnny Depp's Infinitum Nihil. It stars Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley, Chloë Grace Moretz, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, and Jude Law. Hugo is Scorsese's first movie to be shot in 3D. == Plot == In 1931, Hugo Cabret is a 12-year-old boy who lives with his father, a widowed, but kind and devoted master clockmaker in Paris. Hugo's father takes him to see movies and he loves the movies of Georges Méliès best of all. Hugo's father is burned alive in a museum fire, and Hugo is taken away by his uncle, an alcoholic watchmaker who is responsible for maintaining the clocks in the railway station of Gare Montparnasse. His uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks, then disappears. Hugo lives between the walls of the station, maintaining the clocks, stealing food and working on his father's most ambitious project: repairing a broken automaton – a mechanical man who is supposed to write with a pen. Hugo steals mechanical parts in the station to repair the automaton, but he is caught by a toy store owner who takes away Hugo's blueprints for the automaton. The automaton is missing one part – a heart–shaped key. Convinced that the automaton contains a message from his father, Hugo goes to desperate lengths to fix the machine. He gains the assistance of Isabelle, a girl close to his age and the goddaughter of the toy shop owner. He introduces Isabelle to the movies, which her godfather has never let her see. Isabelle turns out to have the key to the automaton. When they use the key to activate the automaton, it produces a drawing of a movie scene Hugo remembers his father telling him about. They discover that the movie was created by Georges Méliès, Isabelle's godfather, an early – but now neglected and disillusioned – cinema legend, and that the automaton was a beloved creation of his, from his days as a magician. In the end, the children reconnect Georges with his past and with a new generation of cinema lovers who have come to appreciate his work ==Cast== * Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret * Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès * Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle * Sacha Baron Cohen as Inspector * Jude Law as Archibald Cabret * Christopher Lee as Monsieur * Helen McCrory as Mama Jeanne * Ray Winstone as Claude Cabret * Michael Stuhlbarg as René Tabard * Emily Mortimer as Lisette, the flower girl * Frances de la Tour as Madame Emile * Richard Griffiths as Monsieur Frick\\ *Marco Aponte as train engineer assistant *Emil Lager as Django Reinhardt, the guitarist == Top ten lists == The movie appeared on the following critics' top ten lists for the best movies of 2011: Critic Publication Rank David Denby The New Yorker 1st Harry Knowles Aint It Cool News 1st Noel Murray A.V.
