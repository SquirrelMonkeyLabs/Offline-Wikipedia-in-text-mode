She discussed it with some people and conducted research in different areas. Together with staff of Ramat Productions, they came up with idea about role of women in determining the king in Hausaland. According to her, “...the story is that it shows that women are the real power axis in Hausa society.” To achieve the primary aim of the project, there was a need for adequate funding and support from development partners like UNICEF, UN Women, UNDP, CEDAW, USAID, DFID and women's organizations. They should support the project morally and financially for the benefit of larger audience in order to safeguard societal values and socio cultural, economic, and political values for women for a better society. She eventually contacted many of them and succeeded in gaining a lot from them. Project Act-Nollywood provided a substantial funding for the startup of the project. === Filming === Principal photography began in March 2016, different areas were assessed but the crew could not find a suitable one which could be used to look as far back as 100 years before the coming of colonial masters into Hausaland. The team agreed to build their own city for the purpose of the project. Danhassan town was chosen and a new palace city was build on rented land of about 4 km2. Initially, the director, Falalu A. Dorayi screened and auditioned principal character (Sarki Yusufa) but when he was on camera, he could not perform effectively. Ado Ahmad Gidan Dabino MON was appropriated for the role and plays perfectly. The movie took about twenty days from 11th February to 3rd March, 2016. The movie was initially targeted for 10 days, however due to some logistics issues, more days were added. For the purpose of the movie, the crew also borrowed a residence of the district head of Danhassan, changed its exterior design and later restored it back to its previous condition. == Other websites == ==References== Category:2017 movies Category:Nigerian movies",
