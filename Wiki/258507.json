 "text": "\"The Importance of Being Idle\" is a song on the English rock band Oasis. It is from their sixth album, Don't Believe the Truth. The song is written and sung by lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. It was the second single released from the album in the UK, on 22 August 2005, where it debuted at number one. It was also the first time that Oasis earned two successive number ones in the same calendar year. It was written by Gallagher in the summer of 2004, before the band made their final attempt at recording what would become Don't Believe the Truth. He got the title from the book of the same name, which he found whilst cleaning out his garage (it belonged not to him but to girlfriend Sara McDonald). The music video depicts a guy (played by Rhys Ifans) going outside and walking through town. He then precedes to bounce off coffins before being buried alive.
