 "text": "The Golden Team (; also known as the Mighty Magyars, the Magical Magyars, the Magnificent Magyars, or the Marvellous Magyars) refers to the Hungary national football team during the 1950s. It is associated with several notable matches, including the \"Match of the Century\" against England in 1953. The team inflicted notable defeats on then-footballing world powers England, Uruguay and the Soviet Union. The 1956 Hungarian Revolution caused the breakup of the side. The team is considered by many as one of the greatest Football teams of all time. Between 1950 and 1956, the team played 50 matches, which included 42 victories, 7 draws and just 1 defeat. The defeat came in the 1954 FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany. Under the Elo rating system they achieved the highest rating recorded by a national side (2231 points, 30 June 1954), just ahead of 2nd place Germany (2223 points, 13 July 2014). In 2016, the BBC listed the team as the best international football team in football history. The team is generally credited for successfully implementing an early form of \"Total Football\", which would later be used by the Netherlands during the 1970s. ==All-time team highs and lows== The following is a list of national football teams ranked by the highest Elo rating they ever reached.World Football Elo Ratings; under the columns tab choose \"Highest Rank / Rating\" as well as \"Lowest Rank / Rating\" The table also includes the highest ranking as well as the lowest rating and ranking reached by each nation.
