 "text": "The 1922–23 Austrian First Class was organized by the Lower Austrian Football Association and played by its members. The Second class North and the Second class South were a substructure to the first class. Other federal-state associations organized state championships in different modes. SK Rapid Wien won the title for the eighth time. This year, there were three relegated teams. The association went back to a 12-team championship, and there were two second classes this season, which resulted in two promoted teams. Hertha, Sport-Club, WAF, Simmering, and Admira renovated their grounds. They played a large part of their home games in foreign places. ==Table== Pl. Name M W D L P 1\\.
