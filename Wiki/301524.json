 "text": "A blenny is a member of a large order of teleost fish called the Blenniiformes. The suborder has about 900 species in 151 genera. Blennies are generally small fish. They have long bodies (some almost eel-like), and relatively large eyes and mouths. Their dorsal fins are continuous and long. The pelvic fins have a single embedded spine, and are short and slender. The tail fin is rounded. The blunt heads of blennies often have whisker-like structures called cirri. As generally benthic fish, blennioids spend much of their time on or near the sea floor. They are quite similar in form to some gobies. Category:Teleosts",
