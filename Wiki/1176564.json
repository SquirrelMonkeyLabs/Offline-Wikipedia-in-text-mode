 "text": "Neatsville is an unincorporated community in Adair County, in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It is located at the junction of Kentucky Route 206 and Kentucky Route 76. Its elevation is 705 feet (215 m). For unknown reasons, the town's name was spelled as Neetsville from 1876 until 1886, when the town's post office closed. In its early history from around the 1810s to 1900, Neatsville progressively grew to become a well-established, incorporated town. It has been relocated twice through the years, once due to flooding circa 1900â€“1902, which decimated the town, and once in the 1960s when the Green River was impounded to make way for the Green River Reservoir. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Kentucky",
