 "text": "Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide, a chemical compound made out of multiple repeating sugar pieces (saccharides). Hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin. As we age, our skin produces less hyaluronic acid, which can lead to dryness and wrinkles. == Joint Lubricant == But hyaluronic acid isn't just for our skin. It's also found in our joints, where it helps keep them lubricated and cushioned. People with arthritis sometimes get injections of hyaluronic acid to ease their joint pain and stiffness. == Eye Protector == Hyaluronic acid is present in the fluid inside our eyes, where it helps maintain moisture and shape. It's also used in eye drops to relieve dry eyes. Doctors use hyaluronic acid in various medical procedures. It's used in surgeries to help tissues heal and reduce scarring. It's also used in some joint surgeries and eye surgeries. You'll find hyaluronic acid in many skincare products, from moisturizers to serums to face masks. It's praised for its ability to hydrate the skin without feeling heavy or greasy. Plus, it plays well with other skincare ingredients, making it a favorite among skincare enthusiasts. One of the best things about hyaluronic acid is that it's natural. Our bodies make it, so it's unlikely to cause irritation or allergic reactions. That's why it's suitable for all skin types, even sensitive skin. It is found in creams, serums, gels, and even makeup. Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Polysaccharides",
