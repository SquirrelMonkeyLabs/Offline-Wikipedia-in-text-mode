 "text": "The Gendarmenmarkt is a square in Berlin, and the site of the Konzerthaus and the French Cathedral and German Cathedrals. The centre of the Gendarmenmarkt is crowned by a statue of Germany's poet Friedrich Schiller. The square was created by Johann Arnold Nering at the end of the seventeenth century as the Linden-Markt and reconstructed by Georg Christian Unger in 1773. The Gendarmenmarkt is named after the Prussian regiment Gens d'Armes. During World War II, most of the buildings were badly damaged or destroyed. Today all the buildings are restored to their former state. The Gendarmenmarkt hosts one of Berlin's most popular Christmas markets.
