 "text": "Below is a list of the largest stars, so far discovered, ordered by radius. The unit of measurement used is the radius of the Sun (695,700 km; 432,287.938 mi). ==Additional methods== A few stars are in the Zodiac, and the Moon sometimes passes in front of them. This allows calculating their size by their angular size and distance. Most do not, so astronomers calculate their size by their spectral type (which gives their luminosity), distance, and brightness. Other stars can have their apparent diameter measured by an interferometer; If the star's distance is known, the real size can be found. == Caveats == These objects are extremely big, thousand to millions of times the volume of our Sun, and extremely luminous. These stars also have extended atmospheres and photospheres, and are often shrouded in dust. This makes their true size uncertain. Many of these stars vary in size and brightness (like Betelguese, Antares, Mu Cephei and VY Canis Majoris). Galaxies have different properties that affect how large their stars can be. This is why there are separate lists for galaxies. These objects are far away, sometimes intergalactic (eg: WOH G64 is in the Large Magellanic Cloud). This makes it even harder to calculate their sizes. Most stars found will not be above 1,500 times the Sun's radius. Their mass would hardly hold together, and a lot of material would be ejected by powerful solar winds, forming the nebulae we see around them. Astrophysicist Robert F. Wing did an in-depth look on the largest stars, recognising Antares, Betelgeuse, Mu Cephei, and VV Cephei A as well-accepted largest stars, while also looking at other stars known for cool temperatures and high brightness like VY Canis Majoris and NML Cygni. The Stefan–Boltzmann law says these stars would have a large size. While red supergiants and hypergiants are usually the largest stars, some stars can increase their size for a short time before shrinking again. This process is called an eruption. Some eruptions, like those of Eta Carinae and V838 Monocerotis, made them much larger than the largest stars for a short time. These are listed separately. ==List == === Milky Way === List of the largest stars in the Milky Way Galaxy Star name Solar radii (Sun = 1) Method Notes NML Cygni 2,600 (1,100–2,800)https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac168a L/Teff Possibly the largest star known.
