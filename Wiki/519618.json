 "text": "Pseudepigrapha (pseudo = false; graphe = writing) are falsely attributed works. They are written works not by their supposed author. Apocryphal books are Jewish religious works thought to be written about 300 BC to 300 AD. They are distinguished by Protestants from the deuterocanonical (Catholic and Orthodox) or Apocrypha (Protestant). These books appear in the Septuagint and Vulgate but not in the Hebrew Bible or in Protestant bibles.Harris, Stephen L. 1985. Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. The term has also been used by some Muslims who claim that most hadiths are fabrications created in the 8th and 9th century AD, and which are falsely attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.Aisha Y.
