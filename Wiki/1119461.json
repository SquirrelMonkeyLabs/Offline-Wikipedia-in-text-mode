 "text": "The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) is the twelfth studio album by American rapper Eminem. The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) was released on July 12, 2024. During the 2024 NFL Draft in Detroit, Eminem was a part of the presentation. He would release a teaser trailer for his upcoming album during the program. In the teaser, the question of \"who killed Slim Shady?\" was asked over a Unsolved Mysteries style setting with clips of his old music videos being shown throughout it. The album would be heavily promoted with digital billboards in Times Square and a full-page fake obituary in the Detroit Free Press covering the murder of Slim Shady. Right before the album was released, Eminem made a tweet saying that the album was a conceptual album and it should be listened to from front-to-back without skipping to understand the message that he was sending. In the album, Eminem fights with his alter ego Slim Shady. Shady is a character that Eminem played where he had bleached blonde hair and rapped about a lot of controversial topics. Throughout the album, Shady is rapping about controversial things to try and get Eminem cancelled. The songs \"Temporary\" and \"Somebody Save Me\" were written for his family. \"Temporary\" is written for his daughter Hailey to help her grieve after he passes away. In \"Somebody Save Me\", Eminem writes from the perspective of him after he has passed. He apologizes to his daughters and brother for letting his drug addiction take over his life. The album featured the singles \"Houdini\", \"Tobey\", and \"Somebody Save Me\". ==Songs== ==References== Category:2024 albums Category:Eminem albums Category:Aftermath Entertainment albums Category:Interscope Records albums Category:Shady Records albums",
