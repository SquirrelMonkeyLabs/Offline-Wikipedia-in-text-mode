 "text": "Revelstoke Mountain Resort (RMR) is a ski resort near the town of Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. The resort is located on Mount Mackenzie, south of the town of Revelstoke. The resort has 1263 hectares (3121 acres) of terrain to ski on, accessible by chairlifts. It has a 1713 vertical meter descent. The resort has two high-speed quad chairs and an eight-person gondola. Besides the lift-access terrain, the resort also has a large cat skiing operation in the three alpine bowls immediately east of the lift terrain. In addition to the lift and cat skiing operations, there is also a heli-skiing operation with access to 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) of skiable terrain. The resort first opened on December 22, 2007. It was thought to be the biggest North American ski resort debut in twenty years. The event was overshadowed by the death of an Edmonton ski instructor who disappeared on the \"Jalapeno\" run and whose body was found in a tree well three days later. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Ski areas and resorts in Canada Category:British Columbia",
