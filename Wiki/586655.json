Long interested in social causes, he supported such progressive ideas as the single tax as advocated by Henry George in his book Progress and Poverty, free trade, women's suffrage and government ownership of railroads. He was also active in the anti-war movement. ==Awards and recognitions== Perhaps Peabody's best-known legacy is the George Foster Peabody Awards, presented annually since 1941 by the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication for excellence in radio, and, since 1948 ==Death== Peabody died on March 4, 1938 at his home in Warm Springs, Georgia at the age of 85. ==References== ==Other websites== *George Foster Peabody (1852-1938) and Peabody Park at UNCG - A biographical excerpt written by Louise Ware in the Dictionary of American Biography (23: 520–521, 1958) Category:1852 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Educators from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:American philanthropists Category:American activists Category:Businesspeople from Georgia (U.S. state)",
