 "text": "The Solomonic dynasty, also known as the House of Solomon, was the ruling dynasty of the Ethiopian Empire from the thirteenth to twentieth centuries. The dynasty was restored by Yekuno Amlak, who overthrew the Zagwe dynasty in 1270. His successors claimed he was descended from the legendary king Menelik I, the son of the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, in order to legitimize the dynasty's assumption of power. Based on a genome study published in the \"American Journal of Human Genetics\", there is genetic (DNA) evidence that there was gene flow from the Levant (today's Israel and Syria) into Ethiopia 3,000 years ago, during the times of Solomon and David. The origin and date of the admixture is in support of the dynasty's claims (\"Ethiopian Genome and Queen of Sheba\", Sergio Prostak, Sci.News). The Solomonic dynasty remained in power until 1974, when its last emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a coup d'état. The emperors did not use their real name when they became Emperor of Ethiopia, but they made up a regnal name for their rule. For example, the first Emperor of the Solomonids was Yekuno Amlak. But he used the name Tasfa Iyassus after he became ruler. The dynasty began in 1270, when Yekuno Amlak killed the last king of the Zagwe dynasty, which had ruled Ethiopia. Yekuno Amlak was made king, and European historians say was the first ruler of the dynasty. But most Ethiopian books say that Menelik I, the son of King Solomon of Israel and the Queen of Sheba, was the first Emperor of this dynasty.
