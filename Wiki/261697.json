 "text": "Banchan (also known as panch'an), is a word for small dishes of food. They are served with cooked rice in Korean cuisine. The main dishes that are eaten are bap (밥, cooked rice), guk, or tang (soup), gochujang or ganjang, jjigae, and kimchi. The table setting is called 3 cheop (삼첩), 5 cheop (오첩), 7 cheop (칠첩), 9 cheop (구첩), 12 cheop (십이첩) bansang. This depends on the number of banchan there is. In Korean royal cuisine, the table setting is 12 cheop. Banchan are put on the middle of the table and usually shared, though guk (soup) is not shared. Banchan are served little by little. They are meant to be finished at each meal, and more is added if there is not enough. Often, the more formal the meals are, the more banchan there will be. Jeolla province is quite famous for serving many different kinds of banchan in a single meal.Hanjeongsik from Naver open dictionary, food columnist Lee JinRang (이진랑), 2005-07-17 == References == == Other websites == * * Category:Korean food",
