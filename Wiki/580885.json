 "text": "The coat of arms of the state of New York was formally adopted in 1778, and appears as a component of the state's flag and seal. The shield displays a masted ship and a sloop on the Hudson River (symbols of inland and foreign commerce), bordered by a grassy shore and a mountain range in the background with the sun rising behind it. The sun has a face on it. The unheraldic nature of the Hudson River landscape reveals the modern origin of the design. Category:New York (state) New York",
