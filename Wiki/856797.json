 "text": "The Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) is a deer that lives in Central Asia. This species is called endangered on the IUCN Red List and it is given first-class protection by the government of China. ==Appearance== The fur of a musk deer is dark brown. They are 0.5 to 0.6 m high and .85 to 1 m long. They weigh 10 to 15 kg. They have long ears and short tails, and the male deer have very long canine teeth that look like tusks. Male musk deer have musk pods that can weigh 30 to 45 g. Musk deer can live 12 to 15 years. ==Behavior== Alpine musk deer all leave their feces in the same place. Scientists call this a latrine site. They do this to mark their territory, meaning to show other deer that a place belongs to them. ==Threats== Alpine musk deer are in danger of dying out because human beings trap them. Like other musk male deer, male Alpine musk deer have musk pods that people use musk pods to make perfumes and in traditional medicines. When people set traps for male musk deer, they trap and kill female musk deer and fawns too. In the 21st century, one kilogram of musk pod can pay US$45,000. The government of China keeps some Alpine musk deer in captivity. ==References== Category:Deer Category:Mammals of Asia",
