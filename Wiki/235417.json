 "text": "Seismic load is one of the basic concepts of earthquake engineering which means application of an earthquake-generated agitation to a building structure or its model. It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground,The Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering Portal or with adjacent structures,Seismic Pounding between Adjacent Building Structures or with gravity waves from tsunami. Seismic loading depends, primarily, on: * Anticipated earthquake’s parameters at the site * Geotechnical parameters of the site * Building structure’s parameters * Characteristics of the anticipated gravity waves from tsunami (if applicable). Sometimes, seismic load exceeds ability of a structure to resist it without being broken, partially or completely. Due to their mutual interaction, seismic loading and seismic performance of a structure are intimately related. ==Other websites== *Earthquake Performance Evaluation Tool Online ==Notes== Category:Earthquake engineering",
