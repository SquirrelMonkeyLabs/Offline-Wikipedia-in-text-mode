In the Peace of Ryswick, the Spanish gave about a third of the island to the French. In 1804, the colony became independent, and took the name Haiti. The other part of the island was called Santo Domingo, and is the Dominican Republic today. == Related pages == *Haitian Revolution Category:History of Haiti Category:Former colonies in North America Category:French colonial empire",
