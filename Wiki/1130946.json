 "text": "Lasgo is a Belgian electronic music group. The group formed in 1999 and was composed of Peter Luts, Dave McCullen, and singer Evi Goffin. Peter Luts confirmed on Belgian radio in 2008 that Goffin was not returning to the group, after choosing to become a full-time mother. Luts announced around the same time that he was looking for a new vocalist for the group. Together with Belgian TV station JIMtv, he organized a televised search (in similar fashion to talent shows like Idol) for a new vocalist, eventually choosing Jelle Van Dael as the singer. The group name came from McCullen suggesting something related to Scotland, and creating Lasgo out of Glasgow. Throughout their career, Lasgo have sold more than five million units of their albums Some Things and Far Away, and the singles from those albums. Although the group has not officially disbanded, they have not released any material since 2013. As of 2023, Peter Luts has continued to perform as Lasgo. In 2024, Nikki Born joined Lasgo as the new vocalist and frontwoman for the group. Category:Belgian musical groups",
