The movie is about a ship crew rebelling against their officers on the Battleship Potemkin and the events that follow. The film is often considered one of the best movies ever made. == Plot == The film is set in 1905 and is divided into five acts. The Potemkin is part of the Imperial Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet. === Act 1: Men and Maggots === This opening act shows the poor conditions of the crew. Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk are two sailors who talk about the revolution. They want the sailors of the ship to join the revolution. Sailors are sleeping in their hammocks, and an officer beats a sailor. On deck, there appears to be rotten meat. The sailors complain about it and their low rations and refuse to eat it. === Act II: Drama on the Deck === The men who did not eat meat are ordered to be killed by a firing squad. The sailors with rifles lower their weapons and do not shoot. This is when the uprising starts. Sailors throw officers overboard and take over the ship. However, the leader Vakulinchuk is killed. === Act III: A Dead Man Calls Out === The Potemkin goes to the shores of Odessa. Sailors display Vakulinchuk's body in public. The people are sad but inspired. They start getting upset about the Tsar and his government. The sailors say goodbye and praise Vakulinchuk as a hero. === Act IV: The Odessa Steps === Many people have come to see the sailors and say goodbye. Suddenly soldiers (Cossack) start shooting at the people on the steps. They continue to march down the steps and shoot at men, women, and children. A baby carriage rolls down the steps, and a woman shot in the face with broken glasses is shown. The people cry out to the soldiers. In response, sailors of Potemkin shoot at the Opera House. There was a meeting there with Tsarist military leaders. === Act V: One Against All === The sailors go out into the sea to face the fleet of the Tsar. The sailors of the other ships do not open fire.
