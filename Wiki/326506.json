 "text": "Progressive Field is a baseball park in Cleveland, Ohio. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Cleveland Guardians (Cleveland Indians from 1915 to 2021). It opened in 1994, replacing Cleveland Stadium, which had been the Indians' home for over 60 years. The ballpark was originally called Jacobs Field, for a former team owner who had bought the naming rights. The ballpark was nicknamed \"The Jake.\" In 2008, the naming rights were sold to the Progressive Corporation, an insurance company. == Sources == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
