 "text": "The Cardamon shrub frog (Philautus cardamonus) is a frog. It lives in Cambodia in the Cardamon Mountains. People have seen it between 1,000 and 1,700 meters above sea level. This frog can be as large as 19.3 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is light brown and dark brown in color. The eardrum is also dark brown. The throat and chest have white and dark brown color on them. The front legs are short and thick. This frog lives in evergreen forests. Scientists believe this frog hatches out of eggs as small frogs and never swims as a tadpole, but they are not sure. This frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place. Because this frog lives high in the hills, it might not be able to travel to new habitats, such as when human beings cut down trees in between the hills. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
