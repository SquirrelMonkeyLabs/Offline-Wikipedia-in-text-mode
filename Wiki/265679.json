 "text": "The scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) is a bird that lives in the Americas. It likes to make its nests in oak trees that are as high as from 8 to 75 feet (2.6 to 22.5 m) tall. The nests are shaped like cups, like most tree-nesting birds. This stops eggs from rolling out. == References == Category:Passeri Category:Birds of North America Category:Birds of Central America Category:Birds of South America",
