 "text": "Gooloogong is a small town in New South Wales. It is built on the banks of the Lachlan River. It is 57km south east of Forbes, 34 km north west of Cowra and 358 km west of the state capital, Sydney. There are about 250 people living in Gooloogong. The town was established in the 1860s on what was the Pastoral Lease 'Goolagong'of Edward Sheahan from around 1840. The town was originally built much closer to the Lachlan River, but was moved to higher ground because of floods. John O'Meally is buried in an unmarked grave in the Anglican cemetery at Gooloogong. He was a member of Ben Hall's gang. He was shot dead when the gang tried to rob the Campbell's farm, Goimbla Station, on November 19, 1863. ==Facilities== Gooloogong has a hotel, shops and a park. ==References== Category:Towns in New South Wales",
