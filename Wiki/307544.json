 "text": "A term is a mathematical express. ==Definition== In elementary mathematics, a term is either a single number or variable, or the product of several numbers or variables. Terms are separated by a + or - sign in an overall expression. For example, in :3 + 4x + 5yzw 3, 4x, and 5yzw are three separate terms. In the context of polynomials, term can mean a monomial with a coefficient. To combine like terms in a polynomial is to make it a linear combination of distinct monomials. For example, :3x + 2x2 \\+ 5x + 1 = 2x2 \\+ (3+5)x + 1 = 2x2 \\+ 8x + 1, with like terms collected. A series is often represented as the sum of a sequence of terms. In general mathematical use, however, term is not limited to additive expressions. Individual factors in an expression representing a product are multiplicative terms. Indeed, individual elements of any mathematical expression may be referred to as \"terms\". In logic, a term is a collection of symbols used to represent a mathematical object (rather than a mathematical statement). A basic term is either a constant or a variable, while more complex terms can also be built using operators (such as the term 2 \\times (3 + x)). To refer to a term, variables such as \\mathbf{s} and \\mathbf{t} are often used. In informal logic, a term can also refer to the subject or predicate of a statement. ==Specific names for terms== ; Addition and Subtraction * Addend ;* Subtrahend and minuend the first and second terms, respectively, in subtraction ; Multiplication: Factor. In a multiplication of two factors, the first is called the multiplicand and the second is called the multiplier. ; Divisions and Fractions: The top of a division is called the numerator (or dividend), and the bottom is called the denominator (or divisor). ; Term Value: The value of the term such as the term value of 8a, if a=1, is 8. ==Related pages== * Formula ==References== === Citations === === Sources === * Category:Algebra",
