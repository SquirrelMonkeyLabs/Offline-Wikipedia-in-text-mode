 "text": "The Neolithic period is the last part of the Stone Age. After the Neolithic came the Bronze Age. During the Neolithic, people invented farming and started caring for animals, such as cows, sheep and pigs. The Neolithic period started at different times in different places, since not everyone started farming at the same time. The word \"Neolithic\" means “new Stone Age.” It comes from two words in Greek meaning \"new\" and \"lithic\" (\"stone\"). ==Related pages== * Neolithic Revolution * Palaeolithic * Mesolithic == Other websites == * Neolithic Stone Tools and Artifacts—World Museum of Man * Brutal lives of Stone Age Britons * Vincha Neolithic Script Category:Prehistory",
