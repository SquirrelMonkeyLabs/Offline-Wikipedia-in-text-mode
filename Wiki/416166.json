 "text": "Padmé Amidala is a fictional character in the fictional Star Wars universe. She is the secret wife of Anakin Skywalker and the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. She is played by actress Natalie Portman in the prequel trilogy. == History == In The Phantom Menace, Padmé is the fourteen-year-old queen of the planet Naboo. In the movie, Amidala gets captured by the evil Trade Federation, meets the young slave boy Anakin Skywalker, and takes her captured planet back from the Trade Federation. In Attack of the Clones, Padmé is not the queen anymore; she is now an adult, and a Senator. She and Anakin Skywalker fall in love though she said it would make them live a lie. Even though Anakin is a Jedi, and Jedi aren't supposed to get married, Padmé and Anakin got married anyway. Revenge of the Sith is the last movie Padmé is in. She is going to have a baby, and her husband Anakin dreams that Padmé will die when she has the baby. Palpatine, a man that Anakin trusts, tells Anakin that he can save Padmé with the evil Dark Side of the Force. So Anakin goes to the Dark Side but little does he know that the power to save people from death was achieved by a Jedi, not a Sith. He goes to a lava planet called Mustafar, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi, along with Padmé, follow him there. Anakin, who has turned to the Dark Side, thinks that Padmé has brought Obi-Wan there to kill him (she has not). He chokes Padmé using the Force and she blacks out and crumples to the floor. Padmé is taken a little later to a hospital, where she gives birth to twins. Soon afterwards, she dies, but not before telling Obi- Wan with her last breath that she knows there's still good in Anakin.
