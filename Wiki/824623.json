It is a root-like structure which attaches to a tree or other plant host. Fungi and parasitic plants like mistletoe use haustoria to get nutrients from hosts. Contrast with the term epiphyte, which means \"living on\". Many other plants live on large trees, but only a few have hausteria. == References == Category:Plant physiology Category:Parasitic plants Category:Plant tissues",
