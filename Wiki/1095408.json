 "text": "The Piasak-frilled swamp tree frog (Kurixalus appendiculatus) is a frog. It lives in Indonesia. This frog is smaller than most frogs in Kurixalus. People saw this frog near Pasak Village in Indonesia's West Kalimantan Province. It lives in a swamp with woody plants smaller than trees. Scientists think the tadpoles swim in streams but they are not sure. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place, and that place is changing. Human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms or towns. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
