The Robert E. Lee Elementary school was renamed to Olivia Herrera Elementary School in Long beach on August 1, 2016. In this case it was only renaming (which means they left school functioning). California did this to change the things that are related to the Confederacy, such as for it being named after a confederate. Other states have done the same. This includes Montgomery, Alabama, as they are an imoortant figure in the debate, because they were the capital of the Confederate States of America. Other Cali cities had renaming, but only 1 was renamed in San Diego. Country-wide (in America), other buildings, statues and monuments (landmarks and man-made), as well as gifts from the Union, were removed or changed. This happened in multiple parts in America, from both sides. It also happened (here) California, in Florida, Texas, New York, and Washington D.C., among others. ==References== Category:1882 establishments in the United States",
