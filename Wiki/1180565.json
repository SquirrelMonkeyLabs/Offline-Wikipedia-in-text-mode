Vandalism of synagogues and assaults on the survivors were common in cities like Chełm, Częstochowa, Kraków, Lublin, Miechów, Płock, Przemyśl, Radom, Rzeszów and Tarnów.

Some soldiers and policemen joined the riot. The Kupa Synagogue was burned down in the riot, along with the Torah scrolls and religious books.

The Kraków military court sentenced fourteen persons to between one and seven years in jail.

The uniform allowed him to walk around the city safely during the pogrom. ==Related pages== * Babi Yar * Racism in Poland * Jedwabne pogrom * Szczuczyn pogrom * Rhineland massacres ==References== Category:Pogroms Category:Jewish history Category:History of Poland Category:Antisemitism in Europe",
