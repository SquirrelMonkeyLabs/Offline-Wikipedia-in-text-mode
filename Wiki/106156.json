Not including Antartica, the water hemisphere has only one-eighth of the world's land,. Australia, New Zealand, a small part of Southeast Asia and the southern part of South America are in the water hemisphere. Antarctica is included in the hemisphere, and most of it is certainly land.The main parts which are not on land are the Ronne ice shelf and the Ross ice shelf.Stonehouse B. (ed) 2002. Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans. John Wiley & Sons. If it were included in the total land area of Earth, the water hemisphere would have one-fifth of the world's land. Most of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are on the water hemisphere. The area of the oceans of the water hemisphere is much higher than its land area, but the area of the oceans of the land hemisphere is still higher than its land area. ==References== Category:Hemispheres Category:Oceans",
