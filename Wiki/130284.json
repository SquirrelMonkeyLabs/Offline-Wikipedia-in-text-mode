 "text": "Commodore 64 Games System (often abbreviated C64GS) was a cartridge based console made by Commodore International. It was Commodore's first console and was released in December 1990. It was a commercial failure because Commodore could not market the console properly due to its lack of games and the fact it was an 8-bit console in a 16-bit era. ==Other websites== *\"The C64 Console!\" / \"Inside the future: The C64GS\" - By Ed Stu, Zzap 64 magazine, issue 66, October 1990 *The Commodore C64 Games System - Photos and information from Bo Zimmermann's collection *8Bit-Homecomputermuseum - Nice pictures of the C64GS Category:Commodore video game consoles",
