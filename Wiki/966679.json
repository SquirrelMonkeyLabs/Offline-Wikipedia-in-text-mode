He obtained his PhD cum laude in 1975 for a groundbreaking study into aerodynamics and movement of boomerangs, which until then had only been subject to cultural research.Interview met Felix Hess over zijn promotie-onderzoek naar boemerangs, University of Groningen, July 1997 Between 1975 and 1979, Hess worked as a mathematician at the University of Adelaide in Australia. During that period, Hess was inspired by the communication of bullfrogs. Later he 'translated' his findings into moving, interacting sound devices and made presentations with them in galleries and later also museums. Sound animals he build, like bullfrogs, made sounds and responded to each other, but became silent as soon as they detected other unknown sounds. Hess has built various installations related to nature, interaction, senses and silence.Poppe, I.
