Before joining NASA in 1966, Swigert was a civilian test pilot and fighter pilot in the Air National Guard. After leaving NASA, he ran for Senate but lost in a primary election against Bill Armstrong. He later ran for the Congress for Colorado's new 6th district. Swigert won the election, but died before being sworn in. Swigert was diagnosed with nasal cancer while he was running for Congress. At first doctors believed he would survive after treatment, however he was soon diagnosed with bone marrow cancer after having back pain in August 1982. He died on December 27, 1982 in Washington, D.C. from respiratory failure caused by cancer, aged 51. President Richard Nixon awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the Apollo 13 crew shortly after the end of their mission.
