National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Molecular mass is the sum of 2 or more particles or a compound on the Periodic table. They are often in the units dalton (Da). To get the weight of a compound or particles you simply identify the elements in it. Once you have identified the elements look for the atomic mass. The atomic mass is most often right under the name(letters). After finding the atomic mass of however many elements you need, you simply add them together. If you have a compound like H2o, then you can multiply the Hydrogen instead of adding it twice. == References == *LibreTexts. (202, January 26th ). Molecular Mass and Formula Mass.
