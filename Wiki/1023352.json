 "text": "The Women's Equality Party (WEP) was a feminist political party set up in the United Kingdom in 2015. Catherine Mayer and Sandi Toksvig started the party at the Women of the World Festival. Sophie Walker was the leader in 2015. She announced the party's policies at Conway Hall on 20 October 2015. In January 2020, Mandu Reid took over as party leader. == Decision to close party == In October 2024, the party founders decided to close the WEP if the party's members agreed. This was because of lack of money and changes in politics in general. At a special conference on 17 November 2024, 78% of members voted to close the party. The WEP closed on 31 January 2025. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2015 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2020s disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Political parties in the United Kingdom Category:Feminism Category:Organisations based in London",
