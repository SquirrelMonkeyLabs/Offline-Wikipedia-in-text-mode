 "text": "An independent clause, also called a main clause, is a clause that can stand on its own. It contains all the information necessary to be a complete sentence. An independent clause has a subject that tells you what the sentence is about and a verb that tells you what the subject is doing. It expresses a complete thought, relaying that something has happened or was said. * For example, in the sentence, 'My dog loves pizza crusts,' the subject is dog, the verb is loves and your reader now knows that 'your dog loves pizza crusts,' making it a complete thought.
