Scientists think it could live in Brazil too. ==Home== This frog lives in rainforests that have never been cut down and in rainforests that have been cut down and are growing back. People have seen this frog 500 meters above sea level. ==Life== After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries them somewhere. Scientists have seen male R. flavovittata frogs with tadpoles on their backs. They think the male frogs are taking the tadpoles to pools of water in bromeliad plants because that is what other male frogs in Ranitomeya do. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is not danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. But it is in some danger because people cut down trees to build farms and get wood to build with. People also catch this frog to sell as a pet. One of the places this frog lives is a protected parks: Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
