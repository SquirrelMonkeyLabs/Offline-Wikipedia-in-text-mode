On his trail is Heidi, a junkie prostitute, who survived one of his brutal attacks and now strives for revenge. ==Cast== * Ted Raimi as Dennis Skinner * Traci Lords as Heidi * Ricki Lake as Kerry Tate * Richard Schiff as Eddie * David Warshofsky as Geoff Tate * Blaire Baron as Gloria * Christina Englehardt as Rachel * Time Winters as Night watchman * Roberta Eaton as Sandy * Dewayne Williams as Earl * Frederika Kesten as Suzanne * Sara Lee Froton as Young Woman ==Other websites== * Category:1993 horror movies Category:American independent movies Category:American horror movies",
