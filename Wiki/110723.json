 "text": "Dominik Hašek, (born January 29, 1965) is a Czech former professional ice hockey goaltender that played a total of 16 seasons in the National Hockey League. During his playing career he played for the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Buffalo Sabres, and the Ottawa Senators. When he was in Buffalo, he became one of the league's best goaltenders. He was nicknamed \"The Dominator.\" His strong play has been said to have establish European goaltenders in a league dominated by North Americans. Hašek was one of the league's most successful goaltenders of the 1990s and early 2000s. From 1993 to 2001, he won six Vezina Trophies, and in 1998 he became the first goaltender to win consecutive Hart Trophies. During the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, he led the Czech national ice hockey team to its first and only Olympic gold medal. The feat made him a popular figure in his home country and prompted hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to call him \"the best player in the game.\" While with the Red Wings in 2002, Hašek became the first European starting goaltender to win the Stanley Cup. Doing that, he set a record for shutouts in a postseason year. He came in second in votes for the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoff's Most Valuable Player. Hašek was considered an unorthodox goaltender, with a special style that has labelled him a \"flopper.\" He is best known for his concentration, foot speed, flexibility, and unconventional saves, such as covering the puck with his blocker rather than his trapper. On June 23, 2014, Hašek was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1965 births Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Czech ice hockey players Category:Czechoslovak ice hockey players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Hart Memorial Trophy winners Category:Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Category:Living people Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the Czech Republic Category:Olympic gold medalists for the Czech Republic Category:Ottawa Senators players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Vezina Trophy winners Category:International Hockey League (1945–2001) players Category:Ice hockey goaltenders",
