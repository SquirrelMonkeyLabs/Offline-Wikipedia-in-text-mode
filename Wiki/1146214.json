 "text": "Thornton's rocket frog (Colostethus thorntoni) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== Scientists believe that this frog lives near streams and that the tadpoles swim in streams because that is what other frogs on Colostethus do. Scientists saw the frog between 1480 and 2500 meters above sea level. The place where scientists first saw the frog now has a city on it, so they think the frogs do not live there now. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. They think it is in danger because of human beings changing the places where it lives to make farms and towns. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
