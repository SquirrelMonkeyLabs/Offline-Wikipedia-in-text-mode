 "text": "The Ghana Football Association was the governing body of association football in Ghana from 1957 to 2018, based in Kumasi. The association was dissolved with \"immediate effect\", according to Minister of Sport, Isaac Kwame Asiamah, on 7 June 2018, after the uncovering of a corruption scandal. In October 2019, a new president Kurt Okraku was elected. Mr Mark Addo was elected vice president in November 2019. In an exclusive interview with TV3, Anas indicated that Mr. Nyantakyi appeared experienced in scamming and rather gave him, Anas, tutorials on how to scam people including the institution Nyantakyi headed. The embattled GFA boss was caught on camera scheming with the undercover journalist to defraud the Ghana Football Association and to also bribe their way through several contracts to eventually “take over” the country.
