 "text": "\"Here Comes the Sun\" is a song by George Harrison from The Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road. ==Origin== Harrison stated in The Beatles Anthology: ==Recording== Harrison, McCartney and Starr recorded the song in 13 takes on July 7, 1969. John Lennon did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a car crash. Towards the end of the session, Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part. Harrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret, resulting the final key of A major. He also used the same technique on his 1965 song \"If I Needed Someone,\" which shares a similar melodic pattern. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound. A harmonium and handclaps were added on July 16. Harrison's guitar solo was overdubbed on 6 August, and the orchestral parts were added on 15 August. \"Here Comes the Sun\" was completed four days later with the addition of Harrison's Moog synthesizer part. ==Personnel== *George Harrison – vocal, backing vocal, acoustic guitar, Moog synthesizer, handclaps *Paul McCartney – backing vocal, bass, handclaps *Ringo Starr – drums, handclaps *Uncredited – four violas, four cellos, double bass, two piccolos, two flutes, two alto flutes, two clarinets :Personnel per Ian MacDonald ==Notes== ==Other websites== * * * * * Category:1969 songs Category:The Beatles songs",
