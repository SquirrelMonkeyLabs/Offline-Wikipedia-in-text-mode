 "text": "The Gulf of Mexico () is an ocean basin or bay of the Atlantic Ocean. It is a marginal sea of North America. The United States of America, Mexico, and Cuba are the countries around it. The Straits of Florida connect to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean, and the Yucatán Channel connects to the Caribbean Sea. Because of its narrow connection to the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf has very small tides. The size of the Gulf basin is about 1.6 million square kilometers (615,000 square miles). Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters. The climate is tropical, with heavy growth of plankton and sea grass. Petroleum is found near the north and west coast of this gulf. Many hurricanes hit this area — for example, in 2005 Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hurt many of the oil wells in the United States. The Gulf of America is one of the most important offshore petroleum-production regions in the world, making one- sixth of the United States' total production. There is also a big fishing industry in the Gulf. The Gulf was formed by plate tectonics about 300 million years ago.Huerta A.D. & Harry D.L. 2012.

Geosphere. 8(1):GES00725.1, March 6, 2012. ==Gulf of America== On January 20, 2025, United States president Donald Trump signed an executive order that told United States executive branch federal agencies to use \"Gulf of America\" instead of \"Gulf of Mexico\". The order said that this would happen to the northernmost part of the Gulf within U.S. boundaries and would be changed in federal documents. This change was done on January 24, 2025. The order is not binding on any other part of, or outside, the federal government. Other countries bordering the Gulf, including Mexico and Cuba, have said they will continue to use the \"Gulf of Mexico\" name. Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Bing Maps have chosen to vary the name displayed for the Gulf based on user location.Google Maps to rename 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' for US users, Reuters, January 28, 2025 People in the United States see \"Gulf of America\"; people in Mexico see \"Gulf of Mexico\"; and, in all other countries, \"Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)\". On January 23, 2025, the Associated Press (AP), a major news organization, announced that its reports would use \"Gulf of Mexico\" while noting Trump's decision to call it the \"Gulf of America\". On February 11, 2025, the White House started to block AP reporters from the Oval Office and Air Force One because the AP did not fully adopt \"Gulf of America\". Most other major news websites and organizations also continue to use \"Gulf of Mexico\", as they follow AP guidance. Some Republican-leaning news outlets, such as Fox News, use \"Gulf of America\" instead. Axios and USA Today use both names for the gulf in tandem. Some broadcast weather reporters have opted to call it simply \"the Gulf\". == Notes == == References == == Other websites== * Resource Database for Gulf of Mexico Research * Mexico Category:Atlantic Ocean Category:Bodies of water of the United States Category:Geography of Cuba Category:Geography of Mexico",
