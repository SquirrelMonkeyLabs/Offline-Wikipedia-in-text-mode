Both Prince Bertrand and Prince Pedro Carlos are great-great-grandchildren of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, of the House of Braganza. They disputed leadership over Brazilian Imperial Family due to a dynastic dispute concerning their fathers, who were cousins.

His godparents were his great-uncle Prince Gennaro of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and his aunt Princess Pia Maria, Countess of Nicolaÿ. His elder brothers are, in order, Luiz, Prince of Brazil, who is the present Head of the Brazilian Imperial Family according to the Vassouras branch claim and Prince Eudes of Brazil, who renounced his dynastic rights to the Brazilian Throne. By his father's side he is a great- grandson of Empress Isabel of Brazil while by his mother's side he is a great- grandson of King Ludwig III of Bavaria.

The prince and his brother collaborate with the Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira Institute (IPCO) and the Founders' Association. They both oppose same-sex marriage, abortion, and land reform. Bertrand often displays prejudice against Protestantism. He also denounces globalism and some environmental campaigns as ecoterrorism and labels global warming an \"environmental myth\".
