 "text": "Bernard Hinault (born 14 November 1954) in Yffiniac is a French cyclist who won the Tour de France five times. He is also one of only seven cyclists to have won all three Grand Tours, the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, and the Vuelta a España. He is one of the two cyclists who has won each Grand Tour more than once. He won the Tour de France in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1985. He was first in the Giro d'Italia in 1980, 1982 and 1985. He was first in the Vuelta a España in 1978 and 1983. Hinault had the nickname Le Blaireau (the Badger). Hinault says this was a local custom with cyclists when he was young. Professional cyclists used the nickname because badgers do not let go of their prey (animals they want to eat) easily. People know him as a very independent and strong man. == Professional highlights == === Pro Team Sponsors === *Gitane-Campagnolo: 1977 *Renault-Elf-Gitane: 1978-1983 *La Vie Claire: 1984-1986 === Main victories === ;1977 :Liège-Bastogne-Liège :Gent-Wevelgem :Grand Prix des Nations :Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré ;1978 :Tour de France :: 1st place overall classification ::Winner stages 8, 15 and 20 ::3 days in yellow jersey : Vuelta a España :Grand Prix des Nations ;1979 :Tour de France :: 1st place overall classification :: 1st place points classification ::Winner stages 2, 3, 11, 15, 21, 23 and 24 ::17 days in yellow jersey :Giro di Lombardia :La Flèche Wallonne :Grand Prix des Nations :Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré ;1980 :Tour de France ::Winner prologue, stages 4 and 5 ::2 days in yellow jersey :Giro d'Italia :: 1st place overall classification ::Winner stage 14 ::5 days in pink jersey : World Road Cycling Championship :Liège-Bastogne-Liège :Tour de Romandie ;1981 :Tour de France :: 1st place overall classification ::Winner stages 7, 16, 20 and 22 ::18 days in yellow jersey ::Winner Combativity award :Paris-Roubaix :Amstel Gold Race :Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré ;1982 :Tour de France :: 1st place overall classification ::Winner prologue, stages 15, 20 and 22 ::12 days in yellow jersey :Giro d'Italia :: 1st place overall classification ::Winner prologue, stages 3, 12, 18, 22 ::15 days in pink jersey :Grand Prix des Nations ;1983 : Vuelta a España :La Flèche Wallonne ;1984 :Tour de France ::Second place overall classification ::Winner prologue ::1 day in yellow jersey ::Winner Combativity award :Giro di Lombardia :Grand Prix des Nations :Quatre Jours de Dunkerque ;1985 :Tour de France :: 1st place overall classification ::Winner prologue, stage 8 ::16 days in yellow jersey :Giro d'Italia :: 1st place overall classification ::Winner stage 12 ::10 days in pink jersey ;1986 :Tour de France ::Second place overall classification :: 1st place mountains classification ::Winner stages 9, 18 and 20 ::5 days in yellow jersey ::Winner Combativity award Hinault also won the season-long Super Prestige Pernod International competition four times from 1979 to 1982, the same as Jacques Anquetil's total. == References == * Memories of the peloton by Bernard Hinault, Vitesse Press, ©1989., * Hinault par Hinault by Bernard Hinault, Editions Jacob Duvernet, ©2005.
