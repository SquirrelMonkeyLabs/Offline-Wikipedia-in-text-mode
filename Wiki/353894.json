 "text": "The magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is the most numerous of the Spheniscus family. There are about 3,600,000 magellanic penguins in the world. They breed once a year and lay two eggs of a similar size. They are 70 centimetres tall and weigh 9 pounds or 4 kilograms. They are found in the Falkland Islands, South America, Chile and Argentina and migrate Brazil. They are warm weathered penguins and during the warm weather they lose feathers around their eyes. When it gets colder they grow these feathers back around their eyes. They were first seen in 1519 on a voyage (trip) to South America. They hunt for food on their own when they are 60-70 days old. ==Other websites== * * Category:Penguins",
