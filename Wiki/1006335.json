 "text": "The Iowa Cubs are a Minor League Baseball team from Des Moines, Iowa. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Cubs are partnered with the Chicago Cubs, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Chicago Cubs. The team is named \"Cubs\" because of their partnership with the Chicago Cubs. The team started playing in 1969 but were named the Iowa Oaks. They changed their name to the Cubs in 1982. The Cubs played at a stadium called Sec Taylor Stadium from 1969 to 1991. In 1992, the Cubs began to play at a new stadium called Principal Park. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1960s establishments in the United States Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Chicago Cubs Category:Des Moines, Iowa Category:Sports in Iowa",
