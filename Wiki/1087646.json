 "text": "Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar (; 14 March 1742 â€“ 17 June 1797), also known by his regnal name of Agha Mohammad Shah (), played a significant role in Iranian history as the founder of the Qajar dynasty. He ruled as Shah from 1789 to 1797, leading Iran through a period marked by both centralized power and military conquests. Originally part of the Quwanlu branch of the Qajar tribe, Agha Mohammad Khan became the king of Iran in 1789. However, his official coronation didn't take place until March 1796. His rise to power involved the deposition of Lotf Ali Khan from the Zand dynasty in 1794. Notably, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar endured a challenging personal journey, having been castrated as a young adult when captured by Adel Shah Afshar. This left him childless, and he adopted the regnal name Agha Mohammad Shah upon ascending the throne. Agha Mohammad Khan's reign is marked by significant achievements and actions. One of his notable accomplishments was the reunification of a centralized Iran, bringing about a sense of unity. He also played a crucial role in moving the capital to Tehran, a decision that still impacts the country today. Despite his achievements, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar is remembered for his ruthless behavior during military campaigns, particularly in Georgia and Kerman. His cruelty and rapacious actions earned him a reputation that, while negative, also highlights his effectiveness as a military and political leader. However, historical perspectives on Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar are not one-sided. Many view him as a pragmatic, calculating, and shrewd leader who made strategic decisions for the benefit of Iran. His reign, though relatively short-lived, left a lasting impact on the country's political landscape. Tragically, Agha Mohammad Khan's life was cut short when he was assassinated on 17 June 1797. Following his death, his nephew, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, succeeded him as the ruler of Iran. ==Legacy== In summary, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar's legacy is complex, marked by achievements in unifying Iran and establishing Tehran as the capital, as well as criticisms for his ruthless actions during military campaigns. His reign, though relatively brief, laid the foundation for the Qajar dynasty, leaving an indelible mark on Iranian history. == References == Category:Shahs of Iran Category:1742 births Category:1797 deaths",
