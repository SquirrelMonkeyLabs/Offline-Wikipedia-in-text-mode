They also perform skits and songs throughout the shows featured on the block. Their segments were videotaped at the short-lived World of Sid and Marty Krofft indoor amusement park in Atlanta. For the block’s last years (1977-1978), their image was toned down, and they were downsized from a five- person band to a four-person band, and because The World of Sid and Marty Krofft closed down, their season-two segments were taped in a studio with an audience of children. === Recurring sketches from Kaptain Kool & The Kongs: === * Songs - Songs preformed by Kaptain Kool & The Kongs. * Nashville’s How To… - Nashville gives how-to tips to the audience, with Turkey mostly being the assistant. (1977-1978) * This Week’s Letter (To the Kaptain…) - Kaptain Kool gets letters sent from people and answers them. (1977-1978) * Turkeys From the Turkey - Turkey would read a nonsensical poem about moral life lessons.
