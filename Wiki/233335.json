 "text": "A goldsmith is a person who makes objects using gold or other precious metals. 5,000 years ago, ancient Sumerians made bowls out of gold. People have long used gold for making jewelry or sacred objects used in religious worship. In medieval Europe goldsmiths often acted as bankers. Goldsmiths use methods such as soldering, sawing, forging, casting, and polishing to make things out of gold. Goldsmiths traditionally teach their trade to apprentices. Today, jewelry arts schools teach goldsmithing and other similar skills. == Well known goldsmiths == * Paul de Lamerie * Paul Storr * Lorenzo Ghiberti * Benvenuto Cellini * Johannes Gutenberg * House of Faberg√© ==Related pages== * Old master print * Engraving * Jewelry * Metalworking Category:Gold Category:Metalworking occupations",
