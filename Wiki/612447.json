 "text": "Oscar Alberto \"Lito\" Cruz (May 14, 1941 – December 19, 2017) was an Argentine stage director, playwright and actor. He was born in Berisso, Argentina. His career began in 1968. During his career, he won two Martín Fierro Awards (2011, 2014). He was known for his roles in El elegido and in Solamente vos. Cruz was appointed as National Theatres Director in 1995, a position he used to help have Congress pass the \"National Theatre Law\" in 1998. The bill helped protect struggling stages against demolition and guaranteed annual subsidies for the art. Cruz created and produced Sueños de milongueros in 2009, a musical written in homage to authors Jorge Luis Borges and Alejandro Dolina, and cartoonist/satirist Roberto Fontanarrosa. Cruz died in Buenos Aires on December 19, 2017 of a heart attack at the age of 76.Murió Lito Cruz ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1941 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Argentine movie actors Category:Argentine television actors Category:Argentine stage actors Category:Argentine writers Category:Argentine playwrights Category:Argentine movie directors Category:Argentine theatre directors",
