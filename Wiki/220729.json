 "text": "The European honey bee or western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the main species of honey bee. The genus Apis is Latin for \"bee\", and mellifera comes from Greek melli- meaning \"honey\" and ferre \"to bear\". So, the scientific name means \"honey-bearing bee\". In 1758 Carolus Linnaeus named the bees as Apis mellifera. However, he later found out that bees do not bear honey, but they actually bear nectar. Because of this, he tried to change it to Apis mellifica (\"honey-making bee\") later. Workers do a waggle dance in the beehive to tell the others where they have found nectar; Karl von Frisch discovered this. == Other websites == *Flight of Honey Bee finally understood *Honey Bee Pheromones *Cornwall Honey Beepedia *BeeSource *Honey Bee Apis mellifera diagnostic pictures, descriptions, natural history *Brother Adams On-line book *Beekeeping explained by the Food and Agriculture Organization *Types of hives by FAO *Interactive 3D flash presentation of Honey beehive from PBS *Brainy Bees Think Abstractly *Digital library of Beekeeping *Anatomy of the honeybee by the FAO *Apis mellifera pomonella, a new honey bee subspecies from Central Asia; Apidologie 34 (2003) 367-375; Sheppard and Meixner *Origin of honeybees from the Yucatan peninsula inferred from mitochondrial DNA analysis; Molecular Ecology (2001)10, 1347-1355 *Cyclopedia of American Agriculture ed. by L.
