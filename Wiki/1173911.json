 "text": "Tolcsva is a village in Sárospatak District of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. Its population in 2024 was 1454. == Location == It borders five vine-growing settlements; its neighbors are: Erdőhorváti to the north and northwest, Sárazsadány to the east and southeast, Olaszliszka to the south-southwest, Erdőbénye to the west, and Vámosújfalu to the south. === Geography === Its terrain is primarily characterized by minimal vertical variation and hills that do not exceed 300 meters above sea level. The subsoil consists of rhyolite tuff and zeolite from post-volcanic activity, while the surface is mainly covered by Ice Age loess and humus-rich soil. Overall, the settlement has excellent natural and geographical conditions, which are key factors in successful viticulture. == History == Tolcsva and its surroundings have been inhabited since the Paleolithic era, as evidenced by archaeological finds in the area. It was first mentioned in documents in 1255 under the name Tolchwa. From 1511, it was owned by various noble families, including the Bánffy, Eödönffi, Dobó, Gerendi, Czékei, Mezőssy, Szekrényessy, Dessewffy, and many others. In 1602, it belonged to the Lónyay family, and in 1630, to the Rákóczi family. In 1486, Tolcsva was granted market town status and enjoyed various town privileges in the following years. By the late 18th century, Tolcsva was integrated into the national postal network. A medicinal bath operated in the village. According to the 1828 census, there were 501 houses in the settlement. Between 1850 and 1945, significant changes took place in the social, economic, and cultural life of Tolcsva. In 1856, a severe fire devastated the settlement, destroying many public buildings and 90 houses. The crafts industry continued to operate within a unified guild system. The Compromise of 1867 established modern public administration, economic management, banking operations, and reorganized education and cultural governance on new foundations. The 1886 public administration law downgraded the town to the status of a large village. In 1913, a major flood struck the settlement, submerging around 160 homes. Following this natural disaster, a world war broke out, claiming many lives. During the war years, Tolcsva residents were present not only on the battlefields but also in war factories. The devastation of the war and the Treaty of Trianon negatively impacted Tolcsva’s development after 1920. On December 17, 1944 Soviet soldiers marched in. The Soviet directives placed a heavy burden on the population, including the inventory and confiscation of wine stocks, as well as the requisition of crops, livestock, feed, food, and other supplies for military purposes. In March 1945, land distribution began in Tolcsva. In 1947, the village was electrified, and in 1948, schools were nationalized. A cinema started operating, the cultural center and library began institutionalized operations, and a savings bank was established. == Population == In 2022, 90.8% of the population said they were Hungarian, 6% said Rusyn, 4.4% said Roma, 0.1% said German, and 1.3% said they were other non-local nationalities (9.1% did not answer; the total can be more than 100% because of dual identities). For religion, 36.7% were Roman Catholic, 11.7% were Reformed, 18.7% were Greek Catholic, 0.2% were Lutheran, 0.1% were Jewish, and 3.1% had no religion (29.1% did not answer).Tolcsva == Economy == In the 17th to 19th centuries, the basic economic and geographical feature of the countryside was the grape and wine industry. However, field farming, animal husbandry, forest use, and related industries also played a big role in Tolcsva. The people living here grew wheat, corn, rye, and oats in a two-field system. They used the forest for building, heating, feeding pigs with acorns, grazing, and hunting. Several powerful mills operated along the stream next to Tolcsva. In the garden orchards, they grew plums, walnuts, and pears. == Sights == Tolcsva's tourist attraction comes from its many historical monuments, the world-famous Tokaj- Hegyalja wine, and the region's stunning, almost untouched natural beauty. The village is especially rich in monument-like buildings, represented by the castles of Hegyalja's famous vineyard owners. === Greek Catholic Church === In the 18th century, Rusyns immigrated and brought their religion with them. Their church was consecrated in 1859 in honor of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. === Reformed Church === The Calvinist community in Tolcsva was relatively small. The church that still stands today was built between 1864 and 1869, after the previous church burned down. === Roman Catholic Church === The Hungarian Holy Crown was kept in the church from March 14-20, 1806. The church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The church was twice owned by the Calvinists, but from 1711 it was used by the local Roman Catholic community. === Castles === In addition to the churches, Tolcsva has other significant monuments, castles, merchant and citizen houses. * The Rákóczi Castle was built in the early Baroque style. Its size and architectural features make it a typical example of 17th-century Hungarian architecture. The monument was restored in 1960. Since 1972, it has housed a museum of viticulture and winemaking, preserving the physical and cultural memories of Tolcsva’s vineyards and wine production. * The Dessewffy Castle was built in 1659. After several ownership changes, it came into the Dessewffy family’s possession in the 19th century, and they made changes to suit their needs. The building is surrounded by a farm complex and a large garden. * The Szirmay-Waldbott Castle, Tolcsva’s third significant castle, was built around 1820 in the Classicist style by Ádám Szirmay. It was later altered and expanded with eclectic additions, taking its current form at the end of the 19th century under Baron Frigyes Waldbott’s renovations. * At 64 Kossuth Street stands the so-called Stépán Manor, a typical example of 19th-century Classicist noble houses, likely built in the 1820s. In recent years, due to privatizations in the region’s economy, foreign companies have recognized Tolcsva’s tourism potential and become regular visitors to the village. The growing interest from tourists has also boosted domestic tourism. In recent years, the number of quality accommodations and dining options has increased significantly. Visitors enjoy unforgettable experiences like wine tastings combined with cellar tours, paired with local traditional foods. == Resources == * Borovszky Samu: Zemplén County * Attila Szekrényessy : The Story of a Borsod Manor House Bp. 2006. ==References== Category:Villages in Hungary Category:Settlements in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County",
