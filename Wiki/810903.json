 "text": "The Pennsylvania General Assembly is the legislature of Pennsylvania. It has two parts: the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (lower house) and the Pennsylvania State Senate (upper house). Before this legislature started, there was the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly. This was unicameral, which means it had only one house. It has been called the general assembly since 1776, and has been bicameral (has two houses) since 1791. Both houses meet in the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. They are both controlled by the Republican Party as of 2020. ==Leadership== ===Pennsylvania House of Representatives=== Speaker of the House of Representatives: Bryan Cutler (R) Majority Party (R) Leadership Position Minority Party (D) Kerry Benninghoff Floor Leader Joanna McClinton Donna Oberlander Whip Jordan Harris Mike Reese Caucus Chairperson Dan Miller Martina White Caucus Secretary Tina Davis Stan Saylor Appropriations Committee Chairperson Matt Bradford Kurt Masser Caucus Administrator Mike Schlossberg Martin Causer Policy Committee Chairperson Ryan Bizzarro ===Pennsylvania State Senate=== President pro tem of the Senate: Jake Corman (R) Majority Party (R) Leadership Position Minority Party (D) Kim Ward Floor Leader Jay Costa John Gordner Whip Anthony H.
