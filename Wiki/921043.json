 "text": "The Taiwan independence movement is a political movement which supports an independent and sovereign Taiwanese state. People who support this movement are against the idea of \"Two Chinas\" or Taiwan being part of China. Currently, Taiwan's political status is mixed. China says it is a province of the People's Republic of China. Taiwan and other islands are currently under the control of the Republic of China (ROC), a country that has official diplomatic relations with and is recognized by 13 United Nations-recognized countries. Today, Taiwan says it is already an independent country, and therefore does not have to push for any sort of formal independence. ==References== Category:Politics of Taiwan",
