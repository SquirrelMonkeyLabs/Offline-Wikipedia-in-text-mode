 "text": "Kenneth Murray Brown (born December 19, 1948 in Port Arthur, Ontario) is a former professional ice hockey goaltender. Despite winning the CMJHL Goaltender of the Year and being on the CMJHL First All-Star Team in 1967, Brown went undrafted coming out of junior, so he signed a free agent contract with the Dallas Black Hawks of the CHL, the Chicago Black Hawks minor league affiliate. He played one game with Chicago, where he was behind Tony Esposito and Gerry Desjardins on the depth chart, and this was his only time game in the National Hockey League. He was selected by Calgary-Cleveland in the 1972 WHA General Player Draft, although his rights were traded to the Alberta/Edmonton Oilers for cash. Brown won 21 games over two seasons as the backup to Jacques Plante. ==Other websites== * * *Article on WHA featuring Brown Category:1948 births Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Thunder Bay Category:World Hockey Association players",
