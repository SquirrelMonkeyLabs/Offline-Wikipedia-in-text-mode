He was a pupil of Jean-Georges Noverre and made his debut at the Paris Opéra on June 12, 1762. He was a superb mime. He choreographed few ballets, but is credited with creating the comedy ballet. His best known work is La Fille mal gardée, which is one of the oldest ballets still performed. ==References== * Beaumont, Cyril W. 1935. The Complete Book of Ballets. Grosset & Dunlap. pp. 1-5.
