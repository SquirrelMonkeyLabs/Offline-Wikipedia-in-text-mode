He is also the earliest known ruler of the Shawnee Tribe. ==Family== Tecumseh had a brother named Tenskwatawa. Tenskwatawa was known as the town drunkard in the town until he changed and became religious. When Tecumseh left for a business trip and left Tenskwatawa in charge, he didn't do a good job. He started a war with his leadership, and a while after Tecumseh returned, Tecumseh was killed. Tecumseh also has a son named Cheeseekau. ==References== Notes Category:1768 births Category:1813 deaths Category:Native American people",
