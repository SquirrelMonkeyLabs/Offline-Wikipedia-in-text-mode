 "text": "The Baker Center, previously the Baker School, Baker Junior High School, and W. R. Robbins High School, is a historic building in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Austin, Texas. It has been, in order, an elementary school, a middle school, an alternative high school, and an administrative building for Austin ISD. In 2018, the Baker Center was bought by Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, and it is now their corporate headquarters. It has been a filming location for the TV shows Friday Night Lights, and Walker. As of October 27, 2023, the Baker Center is on the National Register of Historic Places for its importance in educational and architectural history. == History == === Baker School === When it was built, the Baker School replaced the original Hyde Park School. It was identical to the Fulmore Middle School in South Austin, which would later become Lively Middle School. The Baker School was designed by the architectural firm Endress & Walsh and their associate Roy L. Thomas. The school was dedicated on November 28, 1911 as a segregated elementary school for white children living in Hyde Park. It is named for DeWitt Clinton Baker, who was the treasurer of the Austin Library Association in 1875. Additions to Baker School were built in 1924, by city planner and architect Franz Hugo Kuehne, and in 1939 by the firm Kriesle and Brooks. === Baker Junior High School === In the late 1930s, federal aid was given to the school, which was used to create a large rear addition. As a result of the expansion, the school now served elementary and middle school-aged pupils. The district then renamed the school to reflect this. Baker Junior High School was renovated in 1958 and 1961 in an effort to modernize the building, as well as to accommodate the growing population of Hyde Park. The school's \"Band Building\" was established during the renovations. === W. R. Robbins High School === The Baker Junior High School was made into an Alternative High School in 1980. W. R. Robbins closed in 1995. === Austin ISD building === After the closing of W. R. Robbins, the school became the main office for Austin ISD. During this period, the building was used as a filming location for the TV show, \"Friday Night Lights\" and \"Walker, Texas Red\". In 2016, in the wake of budget cuts, the district put the Baker School on the real estate market. They had previously suggested selling the school in 2011. Austin ISD asked that any buyers use the building for educational purposes. In 2017, the school's gymnasium was converted into an art venue named the \"Rosette.\" It has been used primarily as a performance space for Austin Classical Guitar. === Alamo Drafthouse Headquarters === Movie theater chain Alamo Drafthouse bought the Baker Center in 2017 for $10.6 million. Alamo Drafthouse said they would use it as their corporate headquarters, but that it would also create affordable housing for public school teachers. They promised it would not be \"just a development project\". Concerns were raised over Alamo Drafthouse winning the auction, as other bidders had spent millions more on their bids. ColinaWest Real Estate owner David Kahn sued Austin ISD, alleging that they had violated proper vetting processes by not going with one of the higher bids made. Kahn would later rescind his lawsuit. Alamo Drafthouse has not built the affordable housing for teachers. In one of the former classrooms, there are Amish wax figures sitting at desks. These figures are from a wax museum in Pennsylvania, which is owned by Baker Center's co-owner Tim League. In 2020, Alamo Drafthouse sought NRHP status for the Baker Center. It was added to the register in October 2023, which gave the company a tax credit. In 2021, the movie was mostly filmed here. It was then shown at the Rosette on March 31, 2024. == References == Category:Austin, Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Texas",
