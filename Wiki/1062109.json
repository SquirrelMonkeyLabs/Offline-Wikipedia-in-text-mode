 "text": "The Billy Graham rule is a rule that some preachers and Christian leaders follow. They do not spend time alone with any woman except their wife. This is done to avoid sexual temptation, and it may prevent false accusations of sexual misconduct. Some people call this rule the Modesto Manifesto. In 1948, Graham preached in meetings in Modesto, California. Together with Cliff Barrows, Grady Wilson and George Beverly Shea, Billy Graham promised to \"avoid any situation that would have even the appearance of compromise or suspicion\" Seth Dowland, The “Modesto Manifesto”, christianhistoryinstitute.org, USA, #111, 2014 In 2017, it began to be also called the Mike Pence rule. Pence, the former US vice president is a practicing Evangelical Christian. He also supported the idea. Some people do not like the rule. It limits the careers of women who might need to meet with a male boss or co-worker. == References == Category:Christian ethics",
