 "text": "The Malaya stream frog, Malay woodfrog, or Malayan dark-side frog (Hylarana malayana) is a frog from Myanmar and India. Scientists think this might be related to Sylvirana nigrovittata. The adult male frog is 42.2–48.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 47.2–56.8 mm long. This frog is medium-brown in color with small dark spots. Its mouth is white. It has a wide, dark stripe down each side of its body, from its nose to where its legs meet its body. Its belly is white. This frog has vomerine teeth in its jaw. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The adult male frog has stronger front legs than the adult female frog. The scientists who wrote the first paper about this frog named it malayana because it is the only frog in its group that lives in Peninsular Malaysia. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
