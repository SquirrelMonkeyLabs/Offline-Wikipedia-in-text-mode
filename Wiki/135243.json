 "text": "Real time in a narrative is where the events in the story take the same amount of time to happen as they do for the audience to experience them. If a movie told in real time is two hours long, as in Rope, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. For example, in the TV series 24, an hour long episode represents an hour of events on the program. Category:Mass media",
