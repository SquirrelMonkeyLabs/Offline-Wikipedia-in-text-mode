She grew up in Harrow, North West London. Her father is English; her mother is Irish. She first became interested in music during her childhood when she learned how to play the piano. == Moshi Moshi Records == === First album === ==== A side ==== Nash's d√©but single was a double-A side single (recorded in Iceland), released through independent record label Moshi Moshi Records in February 2007. Only 1000 copies were released, and it was on available on 7\" vinyl. Because the single was so popular, 1000 additional copies of the single were made and sold out extremely fast. The A-side was called \"Caroline's a Victim\", an electronic sounding song about Kate Nash's friend Caroline. A video for the song was released and received a lot of airplay on the music television channel, MTV2. The video was directed by Kinga Burza and it featured Nash playing different instruments at the same time that her friend \"Caroline\" sits in her room playing music, taking photographs, trying on different clothes, listening to David Bowie, putting on makeup and sitting at her computer checking a website. ==== B side ==== The B-side to the single was \"Birds\", it is an acoustic song that tells the story of a boy's clumsy attempts to try and explain to his girlfriend how he feels about her, all the while the girl does not know what her boyfriend is talking about. == Fiction Records == In March 2007, Nash was signed to Fiction Records.You couldn't make it up: Nash signs with Fiction, (link ) In April 2007, Nash and other up-coming London acts were mocked through a nasty imitation of Nash's song, \"Caroline's a Victim\" entitled \"LDN Is A Victim.\" The song mocked Nash and Lily Allen, among others, for singing in a Cockney accent, despite their privileged backgrounds. Her second single named \"Foundations\", was released on 25 June 2007 and reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Following the success of \"Foundations\", Fiction Records announced plans to release Nash's album earlier than expected, on 6 August 2007.
