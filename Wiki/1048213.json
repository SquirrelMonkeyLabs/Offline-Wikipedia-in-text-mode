He has been the chairman of the city council of Vantaa since 2009 and a member of the Parliament of Finland for Uusimaa since April 2011. In September 2023, a photo of Lindtman came out, where he is posing alongside two men who are performing the Nazi salute. The photo caused scandal in both Finland and internationally. Lindtman confirmed the photo is genuine but denied ever being a Nazi. He explained it by saying \"the guys went a bit too far with their poses\". ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Helsinki",
