The country became a republic in 1962. Nyerere was the country's first president. In 1964, Tanganyika united politically with Zanzibar and was renamed Tanzania. Nyerere was unopposed as the first president of the new country. Nyerere used political repression against opponents. His attempt at using his socialist ideas of Ujamaa failed. This made Tanzania very poor and caused widespread starvation. He led the overthrow of Idi Amin's regime in Uganda. Nyerere died of leukemia in London, England. == Related pages == * Museum Nyerere Memorial House ==References== == Other websites == *Official website Category:1922 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Deaths from leukemia Category:Presidents of Tanzania Category:Prime ministers of Tanzania Category:Socialists Category:Makerere University alumni Category:Tanzanian Roman Catholics",
