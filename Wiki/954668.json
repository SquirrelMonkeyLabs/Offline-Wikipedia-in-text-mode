 "text": "The Intellectual Dark Web is a nickname for a group of people on the Internet. They use YouTube and podcasts to criticize political correctness and what they call “the regressive left” meaning extremes in left-wing politics. Critics of the Intellectual Dark Web say it just supports right-wing politics and think it encourages extremism about right-wing politics. The Intellectual Dark Web says that this is wrong. Sam Harris used to say he was in the Intellectual Dark Web but then said he no longer supported it because it supports Donald Trump. BreadTube is very critical of the Intellectual Dark Web.
