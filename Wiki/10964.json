 "text": "Richard I of England (8 September 1157 – 6 April 1199) was the King of England from 1189 to 1199. He was also Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony; Lord of Cyprus; and Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes and was overlord of Brittany at various times. He is sometimes called Richard the Lionheart or Richard Coeur de Lion, which means the same thing in French. == Life == Richard was the son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. As the third son, he was not expected to inherit the throne, and he was a replacement child. At the age of 11, he became Duke of Aquitaine. Later, Richard was one of the leaders of the Third Crusade against Saladin. During Richard's journey, he conquered Sicily and Cyprus. He fought in the Siege of Acre and the Battle of Arsuf. In the end, the crusade did not succeed: Richard was never able to win back Jerusalem from the Muslims. He decided to return home to England. On his way back from the crusade, Richard was captured by Duke Leopold of Austria. The English people had to pay a huge ransom to set him free. He was considered a brave and noble king, but he spent only six months of his eleven- year reign in England. He died after being shot with a crossbow while he was besieging a castle in Limousin. Richard’s remains were buried in different places. His body was buried at Fontevraud Abbey near Saumur in France, with his father and mother. His internal organs were buried at Châlus, at the Château de Châlus-Chabrol, near Limoges, in central France. His heart was buried in the Notre-Dame Cathedral at Rouen. Richard’s heart was found in 1838 and was examined by scientists in 2012. They did tests for poisons because one mediaeval story claimed Richard had died from a poisoned arrow. They found no evidence to support the idea. Richard probably died from gangrene or septicaemia from the arrow wound. Richard was succeeded by his younger brother, John. ==Legacy== Because of his military exploits, Richard's popular image is still dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence. Contemporaries considered Richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess, which was apparently the first instance of such a combination. He was known as a competent military leader and individual fighter, who was courageous and generous. Victorian England admired him as a crusader and a man of God and erected a heroic statue of him outside the Westminster Palace. Richard was seen as a pious hero by his subjects. He is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France. == Photo gallery == File:Richard I of England.png|King Richard I of England File:Edith Matilda of Scots.JPG|Matilda of Scotland, Queen of England the great-grandmother of King Richard I of England File:Henry II of England - Illustration from Cassell's History of England - Century Edition - published circa 1902.jpg|King Henry II of England, the father of King Richard I of England File:Berengaria of Navarre, queen of England.jpg|Berengaria of Navarre, the wife of King Richard I of England File:Joan of England.jpg|Joan of England, Queen of Sicily, the sister of King Richard I of England File:Durnstein castle.jpg|Ruins of Dürnstein Castle, Lower Austria,Austria, the first place that King Richard was imprisoned on his way back to England File:20080510-Ochsenfurt Rathaus.jpg|Ochsenfurt, Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany, the second place that King Richard was imprisoned on his way back to England File:Aerial image of Trifels Castle (view from the southeast).jpg|Trifels Castle, Annweiler, Rhineland- Palatinate,Germany, the third place that King Richard was imprisoned on his way back to England File:Château Gaillard (Les Andelys), vu du ciel.JPG|Château Gaillard (Strong Castle), Normandy, France,- the favourite residence of King Richard I of England and built by him from 1196 to 1198 File:ChatoGaillardPano1.jpg|Château Gaillard File:Chateau gaillard.JPG|Château Gaillard File:Chateau Gaillard.jpg|Château Gaillard File:Châlus château (1).JPG|Château de Châlus-Chabrol, Châlus, Haute-Vienne, France, where King Richard I of England was mortally wounded on 25 March 1199 and died of his injury on 6 April 1199 File:Royal Arms of England (1189-1198).svg|Royal arms of England (1189 - 1198) File:Richard I of England - Palace of Westminster - 10092009 crop.jpg|Richard Coeur de Lion outside the Palace of Westminster, London == In world culture == In 1851, the German poet Heinrich Heine wrote König Richard, a poem that was dedicated to Richard and was later translated into several languages. König Richard Wohl durch der Wälder einödige Pracht Jagt ungestüm ein Reiter; Er bläst ins Horn, er singt und lacht Gar seelenvergnügt und heiter. Sein Harnisch ist von starkem Erz, Noch stärker ist sein Gemüte, Das ist Herr Richard Löwenherz, Der christlichen Ritterschaft Blüte. »Willkommen in England!« rufen ihm zu Die Bäume mit grünen Zungen - »Wir freuen uns, o König, daß du Östreichischer Haft entsprungen.« Dem König ist wohl in der freien Luft, Er fühlt sich wie neugeboren, Er denkt an Östreichs Festungsduft - Und gibt seinem Pferde die Sporen.Heinrich Heine's Sämmtliche Werke. Bibliothek-Ausgabe (The Complete Poetic Works of Heinrich Heine. Library Edition), Hamburg: Hoffman und Campe, 1885, p. 45. <1851> King Richard Through lonesome, desolate splendor of woods A rider gallops unabated. He blows the horn, he sings and he laughs With joy, carefree and contented. His armor is thick and his posture is strong, Much stronger is his dedication. King Richard is he, Richard Cœur de Lion, The Lord's army blooms in elation. “Welcome to England!” they say out loud - The green leafy trees by the waters - “We are pleased and happy, O King, that you have Sprung free from that Austrian fortress!” The King breathes free air, in his heart he is glad, He feels born anew and enlivened. That damp dungeon smell makes no longer him sad, He, spurring his horse, is triumphant.
