When full, the lakes cover an area of . Most of it is located in the Mamungari Conservation Park. The Anne Beadell Highway crosses the northernmost arm of the lake. The Serpentine Lakes are considered an important wetlands area. They form part of a major palaeo-drainage system, an ancient and inactive drainage system from the Palaeozoic era. The surface of the lake normally consists of dry clay, silt and sand, and is covered with a salty crust. The sediment is mostly quartz arenite. The lakes form the main channel of the palaeo-drainage system. Other channels are covered by dunes and are not well defined. Tektites high in magnesium have been found in these lakes. ==References== Category:Lakes of South Australia Category:Geography of Western Australia",
