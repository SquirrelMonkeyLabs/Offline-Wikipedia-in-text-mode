 "text": "A condolence book or book of condolence is a book in which people may write their condolences after a death or great tragedy. After the death of a leading figure or great disaster, condolence books are put in public places for members of the general public to use. When closed, the books are given to the relatives. After especially notable deaths, official records of the condolences may be reprinted. For example, after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the Government Printing Office published a leather-bound, gilt-edged collection of official condolences in 1867. ==References== Category:Books Category:Death customs",
