 "text": "The Isdal Woman ( 1926–1934 (most likely 1930) 23–29 November 1970), was the placeholder name of a unidentified woman who was either murdered or committed suicide. Her combusted body was discovered on 29 November 1970, at the base of a cliff in a wooded valley area in Isdalen, Bergen, Norway, by a man walking with his two (2) young daughters. Despite the fact that the woman had died recently (between a few hours and six days), it was difficult to make out her facial features and her clothing due to the upper half of her body and also clothing being combusted. Her identity remains an unsolved mystery and the case remains as one of the profound Cold War mysteries in Norwegian history. Prior to her death and discovery, according to eyewitnesses who saw her, she was a intelligent traveller, who often stayed at hotels during her travel, and also she was a polyglot, who could speak Flemish, German, and English. She was first seen and known on 1 February 1970, when she arrived from Geneva, and last seen alive on 23 November, when she left a hotel and entered a taxi automobile. An eyewitness claimed to see a woman, who resembled her, on 24 November. According to his description, the woman was in the company of the two men wearing black suits, and look frightened. When she opened her mouth, presumably to speak or call out for help, she quickly closed it. The woman is still currently unidentified, and her identity remains an unsolved mystery. Despite the causes of her death being known, there are still many theories as to why and how exactly she died and also to who she really was. ==References== Category:1930s births Category:1970 deaths Category:Drug-related deaths Category:Unexplained deaths Category:1970s in Norway",
