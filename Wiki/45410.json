 "text": "The mast of a sailing ship is a tall vertical pole which supports the sails. Larger ships have several masts, with the size depending on the style of ship. Until the 20th century, a ship's masts would be wooden spars, originally constructed from a single straight tree trunk. As ship sizes increased, taller masts were constructed by lashing up to three spars together. == Other websites == *http://www.bluewatersailing.com/shipclass.php *http://www.hms- trincomalee.co.uk/virtual/rigging/sails.htm *http://tallships.sailtraining.org/sailrigs.htm *http://boatdesign.net/articles/mast-materials/ *Glossary of Nautical terms, sailing and boat parts Category:Ship building",
