It combined the State Savings Bank with nationalized cooperative banks and agricultural credit cooperatives. The bank had exclusive rights to accept deposits from private individuals in the country. At first, these deposits were only used to lend money to the state. Starting in the mid-1960s, the bank was allowed to give consumer and housing loans to private individuals. It has been owned by OTP Bank since 2004. ==References== Category:Banks of Europe",
