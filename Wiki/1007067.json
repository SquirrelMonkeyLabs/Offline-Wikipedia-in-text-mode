 "text": "The Dortmund–Ems Canal is a 269-kilometre (167 mile) long canal in Germany between the inland port of the city of Dortmund (51°31′30″N 7°26′40″E) and the seaport of Emden. It was opened in 1899 to reduce demand on the railway network, which could not cope with the transport of products from the Ruhr area. It was bombed in World War II. There is a long-distance cycling route next to the canal. == References == Category:Canals in Germany",
