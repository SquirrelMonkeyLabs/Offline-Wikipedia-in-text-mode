 "text": "Fiame Naomi Mataafa (born 1957) is a Samoan politician and High Chiefess (matai). Mataʻafa is the first female Prime Minister of Samoa, after winning a majority in the 2021 general election. She is the leader of the Fa'atuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) party. She was Samoa's first female Cabinet Minister, and from 2016 to 2020 was Samoa's first female Deputy Prime Minister. On 24 May 2021, Mataafa had herself sworn in as Prime Minister of Samoa, while the incumbent, Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, did not want to say he lost. This has caused her leadership to be disputed. The crisis was resolved by Samoa's Court of Appeal on 23 July 2021, which ruled that Mataafa had been prime minister since 24 May. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Living people Category:1957 births Category:Prime ministers of Samoa Category:Current national leaders",
