Simon Stevens was the Chief Executive from 2014 to 2021. Amanda Pritchard then took over. In October 2022 she told told local NHS leaders that “the money is a f**king nightmare”. In 2016 it divided England into 44 areas. They have now become 42 integrated care systems. It had a budget of £129.9 billion in 2020-21. Most of the money was given to the local clinical commissioning groups but the 154 most specialized services were managed by them. The start of integrated care systems meant that some of this work could be managed in these larger areas. In 2023 it plans to give the money, £13 billion, for 59 services to 9 committees of integrated care systems. The rest of the £23 billion for specialised services will still be managed by NHS England. == References == Category:National Health Service",
