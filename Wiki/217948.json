Then World War II started and he and his father had to work digging roads and laying gas pipes. They earned £2 16s 6d a week (just over £2.82 in modern money). Then he became a driver for the government. He also managed to do some work as a clown in Blackpool Tower Circus and Tom Arnold’s circus. When Bertram Mills opened his circus again after the war the Polakovs family were all working for him. He was particularly good at stilt- walking. One one occasion he saved the life of a lion tamer who was being attacked by a lion. In 1951, he went with a brother and a sister to work for Billy Smart’s circus.
