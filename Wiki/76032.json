 "text": "Therapsids, previously known as the mammal-like reptiles,They are not reptiles. are a group of synapsids. The clade includes the mammals, which are descended from the cynodont therapsids. == Features == The jaws of therapsids had frontal incisors for nipping, large lateral canines for puncturing and tearing, and molars for shearing and tearing, and chopping food. Therapsid legs were positioned more vertically beneath their bodies than were the sprawling legs of Sauropsids and Pelycosaurs. == Evolution == The therapsids were seriously affected by the P/Tr extinction event. The successful gorgonopsians died out, and the remaining groups were much reduced. The dicynodonts were now a single family of large stocky herbivores, the Kannemeyeridae. The medium-sized cynodonts (including carnivorous and herbivorous forms), flourished worldwide in the early to middle Triassic. They died out across much of Pangea before the end of the Upper Triassic. Some survived for a while in the wet equatorial band and in the South. At least three groups of eucynodonts survived. They appeared in the Upper Triassic. The extremely mammal-like family, the Tritylodonts, survived into the Lower Cretaceous. Another group, Morganucodon and its relatives, were mammaliaformes. That is, their descendants became the mammals. == Taxonomy == * Class Synapsida * ORDER THERAPSIDA * ** Suborder Biarmosuchia * ** Suborder Dinocephalia ** Suborder Anomodontia * *** Superfamily Venyukoviamorpha *** Infraorder Dicynodonta ** (unranked) Theriodontia * *** Suborder Gorgonopsia *** Suborder Therocephalia *** Suborder Cynodontia * ** (unranked) Mammaliaformes * * Class Mammalia == References== * Kemp T.S. 2005.
