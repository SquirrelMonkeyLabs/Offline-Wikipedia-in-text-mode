 "text": "The Ontario Liberal Party is a provincial political party in Ontario, Canada. The party follows a political ideology that is similar to what the Liberal Party of Canada follows. Despite this, the two parties are two different parties. The party comes from the Reform movement in the 1830s and 1840s. The party was organized in 1847 by George Brown. It won the 1871 provincial elections and remained in power until the general election of 1905. Between 2003 and 2018, the Liberals won every election. After the 2018 elections, the Progressive Conservatives took over. They lost almost all their seats in the Legislative Assembly, except for seven seats. Because they only had seven seats, they lost their official party status. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Liberal parties Liberal Category:1847 establishments in North America Category:19th-century establishments in Canada",
