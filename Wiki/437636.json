 "text": "Aidos () was the Greek goddess of shame, modesty and humility. She was a close friend of the goddess Nemesis.Hesiod, Works and Days, 170 ff One source calls her the daughter of Prometheus.Pindar, Olympian Ode 7. 44 ff Aidos is often considered to be more of a personification than a physical goddess. She was said to be the feeling of reverence that stops men from doing bad things. She was also said to be a feeling of shame that a rich person might get when they saw poor people. She is spoken about in some early Greek plays, such as Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus, Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides, and Oedipus Rex by Sophocles. There were altars to Aidos in AthensPausanias, Description of Greece, 1. 17. 1 and in Lacedaemon.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 3. 20. 10 - 11 == References == == More reading == *Mythology by Edith Hamilton Category:Greek gods and goddesses",
