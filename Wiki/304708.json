 "text": "Remoras, sometimes called suckerfish or sharksuckers, are fish in the family Echeneidae of ray-finned fish in the order Carangiformes. They are small fish that live on and around sharks. They eat stray bits of food left by the shark and tiny shrimp-like parasites that live on the shark's skin. They have sucker-like disks on their heads with which they attach to the shark. Both the shark and the remora benefit from the pairing, but the remore benefits much more; this is commensalism. Remora are also known as sucker fish or shark sucker. ==References== category:Teleosts",
