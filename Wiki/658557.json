Some registries may classify the Himalayan as a long-haired sub-breed of Siamese, or a colorpoint sub-breed of Persian. The World Cat Federation has merged them with the Colorpoint Shorthair and Javanese into a single breed, the Colorpoint. Sometimes the breed is called Pakistani breed. The Himalayan Persian is the National Cat of Pakistan.. == Notes == == References == Category:National symbols of Pakistan Category:Cat breeds",
