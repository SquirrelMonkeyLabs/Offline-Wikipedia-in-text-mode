Its capital and largest city is Zagreb. Croatia is a part of the Balkans, and was one of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became independent in 1991. It joined the European Union on 1 July 2013. ==History== In earlier times, the land now known as Croatia was inhabited by different kinds of humans including Neanderthals and Neolithic cultures. In Roman times seafaring pirates known to the Romans as the Dalmatian Tribes lived there, as the Histri, Liburni and the Delmatae. The Romans conquered and annexed the territory in 9 AD. They called it the province of \"Dalmatia,\" named after these tribes. During more than 400 years of Roman rule, the province of Dalmatia would become Romanized. The Roman invaders mixed with the natives. Their descendants adopted a Roman lifestyle even after the collapse of the Roman state in 476 AD. In the early seventh century pagan West Slavs named the Croats (where Croatia gets its name) came to live in the former province of Dalmatia. They conquered the people already living there. They were influenced by Roman Catholic Christian missionaries who completed the process of Christianization in the early 9th century. Tomislav in 925 was the first King of Croatia. Croatia was an independent Catholic kingdom until 1102, when a Hungarian prince inherited the Croatian throne. The Hungarians would rule as Kings of Croatia until the early modern period. The last Hungarian king of Croatia Louis II was killed at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526. The kingdom chose the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand as king the next year. Croatia would remain as a part of the empire of Austria- Hungary under Ferdinand's descendants until 1918. In 1918 it became a part of the Kingdom of Slovenians, Croats and Serbs, later named Yugoslavia. It was occupied in World War II. After a short war with Italy a fascist dictatorship formed the Independent State of Croatia in 1941. It was not independent from the control of Nazi Germany (see also Jasenovac concentration camp). In 1945, Croatia became a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which was non-aligned after breaking connections with the Eastern Bloc. It collapsed in 1991. Slovenia, then Croatia, later the other republics claimed independence and became parliamentary democracies. War in Yugoslavia made a strong impact on society in economic, political and cultural terms. Civil society and media that came out of anti-war struggle in Croatia grew against nationalism, media and civil freedoms, later also corruption. The country's democratic development around 2000, made it possible for Croatia to finally join Slovenia as a European Union member on 1 July 2013.
