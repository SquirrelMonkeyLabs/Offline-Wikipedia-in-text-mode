It is located in the 8th arrondissement, at the eastern end of the Champs- Élysées. == History == The square was designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1755 as a moat-skirted octagon between the Champs-Élysées and the Tuileries Gardens. Initially named Place Louis XV to honor Louis XV of France, it featured an equestrian statue of the king in its center. During the French Revolution, the statue of Louis XV was torn down, and the square was renamed Place de la Révolution. It became the site of many public executions, including that of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and Maximilien Robespierre. The guillotine was erected in the square, and over 1,200 people were executed there during the Reign of Terror. In 1795, after the revolution, the square was given its current name, Place de la Concorde, symbolizing national reconciliation. == Monuments == At the center of the square stands the Luxor Obelisk, a gift from Egypt to France in 1833. The obelisk, originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt, is over 3,000 years old and was erected in the square in 1836. The obelisk is flanked by two magnificent fountains designed by Jacques Ignace Hittorff: the Fontaine des Mers and the Fontaine des Fleuves. Surrounding the square are several important buildings, including the Hôtel de Crillon, one of the oldest luxury hotels in the world, and the Hôtel de la Marine, a historic building that now houses a museum.https://www.lesechos.fr/pme-regions/ile-de-france/jo-2024-les-jeux- paralympiques-soffrent-la-place-de-la-concorde-a-paris-pour-la-ceremonie- douverture-1871402 == Location == Place de la Concorde is located at the eastern end of the Champs-Élysées, making it an important part of the historic axis of Paris, which stretches from the Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre Museum. The square is bordered by the Tuileries Garden to the east and the Seine River to the south, with views of the Eiffel Tower and the Madeleine Church. == Notable events == The square has been the site of numerous important historical events, from royal celebrations to revolutionary executions.
