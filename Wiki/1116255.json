 "text": "Joban Pagi was a notorious Koli dacoit of Gujarat who looted the treasury of the Rajas and Maharajas of the native Princely States. Joban Pagi had also looted the Treasury of Baroda State, the largest princely state of Gujarat. Pagi was born in a Koli landlord family of Vadtal village in Gujarat. Later Pagi became a devotee of Swaminarayan and built a big temple of Swaminarayan in Vadtal. == Phool Dol festival == In Dhaban, the Phooldol festival of Swaminarayan is made which was first celebrated at the behest of Joban Pagi. After becoming the devotee of Swaminarayan, Pagi requested Swaminarayan to celebrate the festival, since then that festival is known as Phool Dol. == History == Jaban Pagi had tried many times to steal Swaminarayan's mare named Manaki during the dacoit life, but failed every time, due to which the dacoit Joban Pagi became Swaminarayan's devotee and retired from the dacoit life. There is also a legend that Swaminarayan was on a tour of Vadtal village and he rested near the Gomti lake when there was a crowd of devotees. There were mango trees near the lake, in which juicy mangoes were planted, so the devotees expressed their desire to eat mangoes, only then Joban Pagi said, if the lord permit me, then I should shoot the mangoes down with the gun. In this, Swaminarayan saw arrogance in Pagi's words and ordered Pagi, if you can do so, of course, put the mangoes down, but not a single mango was targeted on Pagi, after which Swaminarayan asked all the devotees to give up arrogance. And ordered to live peacefully and Pagi did the same. == References == Category:Koli people",
