She formerly served as Chicago City Clerk and as a Illinois State Representative, representing the 1st District of Illinois – which included the Chicago communities of Brighton Park, Little Village, Gage Park and Back of the Yards. She was first elected in 2001 and served into her sixth term, when she won the election for Chicago City Clerk in February 2011. On November 2, 2018 a video leaked from Mendoza’s campaign showing her plans to run for Mayor of Chicago in 2019 even though she successfully ran for re- election as Comptroller in 2018. Eight days after winning her re-election on November 14, Mendoza launched her mayoral campaign. She lost in the first round of the election. ==References== ==Other websites== * Office of the Chicago City Clerk * Rep.
