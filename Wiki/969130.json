 "text": "On 8 October 2022, at 6:07 am, an explosion and fire happened on the Kerch Bridge. It happened on the road part of the bridge. Two road spans of the bridge collapsed into the water. The railway part of the bridge was also damaged by fire. Four people were killed and the Investigative Committee of Russia started an investigation. The bridge reopened in February 2023. The bridge was built in 2018 to supply Russian troops in occupied Crimea during the Russo-Ukrainian War. The explosion happened the day after the 70th birthday of Russian President Vladimir Putin and one week after the announcement of the annexation of four Ukrainian regions by Russia. Another explosion on 17 July 2023 collapsed a span of the road bridge and temporarily closed the rail bridge. The bridge reopened again in October. Ukrainian officials and the military have said they wanted to destroy the bridge earlier. ==References== Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine 2022 Bridge explosion Category:Explosions in 2022 Category:Explosions in Europe Category:October 2022 events",
