 "text": "A time signature is a set of two numbers, one on top of the other one, written right after the key signature in a piece of music. The two numbers in a time signature tell you how many of one kind of note there are in each measure in the song. For example, \\frac 4 4 means that there are four beats in each measure and the quarter note gets one beat. == Finding out what certain time signatures mean == The number in the top of the time signature tells a player how many of a certain kind of note there are in each measure. The number in the bottom of the time signature tells what kind of note is used a certain number of times in each measure. The number on the bottom of the time signature can be any power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 2. So, 64 could be a number that is put in the bottom of the time signature, but 65 could not be one.Time signature information Number on the bottom of the time signature What it means 1 A whole note lasts one beat 2 A half note lasts one beat 4 A quarter note lasts one beat 8 An eighth note lasts one beat 16 A sixteenth note lasts one beat This table shows different numbers that could be the bottom of a time signature, and what they mean. Note that each note down lasts for one-half of the amount the note above it lasted. For example, one quarter note lasts one beat, and one-half note lasts one half of a beat, because one divided by two is one-half. == Time signatures that are used very often == Time signature What it means \\frac 4 4 Four quarter notes in each measureConnexions time signature summary \\frac 3 4 Three quarter notes in each measure \\frac 2 4 Two quarter notes in each measure \\frac 6 8 Six eighth notes in each measure == Symbols that are used instead of time signatures == *The letter C has been used instead of using \\frac 4 4 time. *The symbol \"\" is called \"cut time\" (alla breve) and has been used instead of using \\frac 2 2 time, where every note is cut in half. So, in \"cut time\", a quarter note, which usually gets one beat, gets one-half of a beat. ==Related pages== *Key signature *Note (music) *Bar (music) == References == Category:Musical notation Category:Music theory",
