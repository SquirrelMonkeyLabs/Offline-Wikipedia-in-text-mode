 "text": "Oxane \"Gypsy\" Taub (born 1970) is one of San Francisco's most well-known activists in naturism and \"body freedom\" of the past decade. ==Activism career== On June 18, 2015, Taub along with activist George Davis settled a lawsuit with the city of San Francisco with a one-time payment of $20,000 to the plaintiffs, who had hoped to overturn the city's 2013 ban on unregulated public nudity. On September 25, 2015, a federal judge ordered San Francisco to issue a parade permit to Taubâ€™s group for another naked march after the city had previously denied their applications. In December 2015, Taub was characterized as San Francisco's most notorious nudist. On August 7, 2016, Taub organized a four-hour nude \"Summer of Love\" event with a parade from Jane Warner Plaza to the edge of Golden Gate Park and back, followed by nude dancing at the Plaza. ==References== ==Other websites== *http://www.mynakedtruth.tv/ Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:American political activists",
