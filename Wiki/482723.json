Peppa Pig is distributed by E1 Kids. To date, eight seasons have been aired. It is shown in 180 countries. ==Background== In every episode of Peppa Pig, the family of Peppa Pig does various activities. Mostly, the episodes are about Peppa Pig playing with her other animal friends. ==Broadcast== In the United Kingdom, the first series of 52 ten-minute episodes began on Channel 5 on 31 May 2004. The second series of 52 episodes began on Channel 5 on 4 September 2006, with Cecily Bloom replacing Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa, among other cast changes. The third series started telecasting on Channel 5's preschool-targeted block Milkshake! on 4 May 2009 with Harley Bird replacing Cecily Bloom and Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa. In the United States, the series first aired as part of Cartoon Network's Tickle-U preschool programming block from 22 August 2005 to 2008. For these airings, the show was redubbed with American actors. However, there were no other official releases of this dub, and every US airing since 2006 uses the original British soundtrack.
