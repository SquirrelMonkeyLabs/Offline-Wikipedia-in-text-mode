 "text": "Quolls (genus Dasyurus) are carnivorous marsupials native to Australia and Papua New Guinea. There are six species of quoll, four in Australia and two in New Guinea. The name dasyurus means \"hairy tail\". Adults are between 25 and 75 cm long, with hairy tails about 20-35 cm long (about the size of a cat). Like all marsupials, females have a pouch to carry their babies. Quolls are threatened by eating toxic cane toads, but a University of Sydney project is teaching them not to eat the toads. The family Dasyurini to which quolls belong also includes the Tasmanian devil, antechinuses, the kowari, and mulgaras. == Quoll species == In the genus Dasyurus, these species exist: * New Guinean quoll, Dasyurus albopunctatus, New Guinea * Western quoll or Chuditch, Dasyurus geoffroii, western Australia * Northern quoll, Dasyurus hallucatus, northern Australia * Tiger quoll or Spotted quoll, Dasyurus maculatus, eastern Australia * Bronze quoll, Dasyurus spartacus, New Guinea * Eastern quoll, Dasyurus viverrinus, Tasmania (formerly mainland eastern Australia) There is at least one fossil species from the Pliocene, that is D. dunmalli./deuterostoma/chordata/synapsida/metatheria/notometatheria/dasyuromorphia/dasyurinae.html == References == Category:Dasyuromorphia Category:Marsupials of Australia",
