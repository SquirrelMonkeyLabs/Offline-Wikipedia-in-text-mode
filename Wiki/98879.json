The first time he was in Tekken was the first Tekken game. ==Character== Lee Chaolan was an orphan before the first game started, but was adopted as a child by Heihachi Mishima. Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi's son, was Lee's arch nemesis since they were children. Kazuya always won against Lee. Lee is now in a world of hate because of this experience. He holds a constant grudge against Kazuya. Lee Chaolan's fighting style uses mostly feet. Using his long legs and quick feet, he can take down any foe that comes his way. Kazuya uses a balanced force of fist and foot to take down his foes. Balance is Kazuya's key to victory over his rival Lee. He turned 48 in Tekken 5 but the creators made him look younger.
