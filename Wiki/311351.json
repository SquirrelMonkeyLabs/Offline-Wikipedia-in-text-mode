 "text": "The Cheetah Girls started out as a 2003 Summer Line-Up movie for Disney Channel. Within the two years of release, it gained one of the biggest fan franchises in Disney history as well as on the soundtrack charts having a Double Platinum soundtrack and high-rated DVD release. After all of this success three of the original members, Adrienne Bailon, Kiely Williams and Sabrina Bryan decided to reunite and record a song for the Disneymania 3 CD. Raven-Symoné however declined saying that \"I want to work on my solo career right now. I loved being a Cheetah Girl but I don't want to be known as 'Galleria from The Cheetah Girls’, and as 'Raven Baxter' forever. Right now I just want to be Raven-Symoné.\" Adrienne Bailon (who at the time had a reoccurring role on That's So Raven) claimed to \"understand\" but still said she was \"disappointed\" in Raven for not continuing what she started. However, the 3 remaining Cheetahs recorded I Won't Say (I'm In Love) for Disneymania 3. They also kept their names from The Cheetah Girls movie. Kiely was known as \"Aqua\", Adrienne was known as \"Chanel\" and Sabrina was known as \"Dorinda\". After seeing how much of a response I Won't Say (I'm In Love) received, Disney quickly approached the Cheetahs for a recording contract. Raven was again offered her spot back in the group and again declined. This upset Adrienne so much that she quit as her role of Alana on That's So Raven. The newly reformed Cheetah Girls signed the contract for one album with Walt Disney Records. The stage names Dorinda, Chanel and Aqua were also dropped at this time. Right before the release of their debut album they released a single for the Chicken Little soundtrack called Shake a Tail Feather, a re-make of an old Ray Charles song. Their debut album was a Christmas album titled Cheetah-licious Christmas. They made a music video for their debut single also titled Cheetah- Licious Christmas. They performed this at the Walt-Disney Christmas Day Parade and were featured in The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. After the success of their Christmas album they were reported as signing to Hollywood Records (Owned by Disney but for more successful artists such as Aly & AJ and former Cheetah Raven-Symoné). At this time a Cheetah Girls television series was in the works as well. It did however convince former cheetah Raven-Symoné to return for television and film purposes only. The show filmed 4 episodes when it was stopped because That's So Raven was being renewed for its fourth and final season. The Cheetahs (Including Raven) did however quickly meet up again for a sequel called The Cheetah Girls 2 and recorded a soundtrack for the movie also. It was set to debut on the Disney Channel on August 25, 2006. Raven however left the Cheetah Girls after filming wrapped claiming \"Lots of work\" that had to be completed. The third Cheetah Girls film was made in 2007. They officially disbanded in 2008. ==Filmography== Year Title Role Notes 2003 The Cheetah Girls The Cheetah Girls Raven-Symoné as Galleria Garibaldi, Adrienne Bailon as Chanel Simmons, Sabrina Bryan as Dorinda Thomas and Kiely Williams as Aquanetta Walker Filmed in Toronto, Canada and Manhattan, New York. 2006 The Cheetah Girls 2 The Cheetah Girls [Raven-Symoné as Galleria Garibaldi, Adrienne Bailon as Chanel Simmons, Sabrina Bryan as Dorinda Thomas and Kiely Williams as Aquanetta Walker] Filmed in Barcelona, Spain. 2008 The Cheetah Girls: One World The Cheetah Girls [Adrienne Bailon as Chanel Simmons, Sabrina Bryan as Dorinda Thomas and Kiely Williams as Aquanetta Walker] Filmed in Udaipur, India. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== Year Studio Album 2007 TCG ===Soundtracks albums=== Year Soundtrack 2003 The Cheetah Girls 2006 The Cheetah Girls 2 2008 The Cheetah Girls: One World ===Other Albums=== Year Live Album 2005 Cheetah-licious Christmas 2007 In Concert: The Party's Just Begun Tour ===EPs=== Year EP 2007 TCG EP 2008 The Cheetah Girls Soundcheck ==References== == Other websites == *The Cheetah Girls on MySpace * * * * Category:American girl groups",
