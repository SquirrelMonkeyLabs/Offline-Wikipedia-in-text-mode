 "text": "Jan Peter Balkenende (born 7 May 1956) is a Dutch politician. He was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 2002 until 2010. He is a member of the Christian Democratic Appeal party. Balkenende lives in Capelle aan den IJssel, Netherlands. == Biography == Balkenende grew up in the village of Biezelinge in Zeeland province. He completed his high school at the Christelijk Lyceum for Zeeland in Goes and earned a degree in History and Dutch law from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His political career started in Amstelveen, where he was a city council member from 1982 to 1998. During this time, he also earned a PhD in law and became a part-time professor of Christian social thought at VU, a position he held until becoming prime minister in 2002. Balkenende's political career started very quickly. He joined the CDA faction in the Dutch House of Representatives in 1998 and became the faction leader in 2001 after an internal power struggle. As the party leader, he led the CDA to a big victory in the 2002 elections, which focused on voter dissatisfaction with the previous governments and the rise and fall of Pim Fortuyn. However, the coalition formed by the CDA, VVD, and Fortuyn’s LPF lasted only three months before collapsing. After new elections, the second Balkenende cabinet (2003-2006) was formed, but the coalition between CDA, VVD, and D66 also failed. D66's departure led to the brief Balkenende III cabinet, which became a caretaker government after a few months due to new elections. The fourth Balkenende cabinet (2007-2010) struggled to work together, and it fell in 2010 after a crisis over the Uruzgan decision. After the CDA lost heavily in the 2010 elections, Balkenende resigned as party leader, and his (caretaker) premiership ended with the formation of the Rutte cabinet in October 2010. Much of Balkenende’s time being primer minister was during good economic times. The public debate in the Netherlands focused on identity, with issues of multiculturalism and immigration becoming political topics. Balkenende positioned himself as a defender of values and norms and led the search for national identity. The economic climate shifted towards the end of his premiership due to the financial crisis, and the government intervened by supporting struggling banks. Policy changes also included a significant reform of the healthcare system in 2006. Since late 2010, Balkenende has been a professor of Governance, Institutions, and Internationalisation at Erasmus University Rotterdam. From 2011, he worked for Ernst & Young (EY) as a partner and later as an external advisor. Since 2021, he has also worked as an independent professional at Hague Corporate Affairs. == References == * Bio at Parlement.com == Other websites == * Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Christian Democratic Appeal politicians Category:Dutch academics Category:Dutch Calvinists Category:Dutch councillors Category:Dutch jurists Category:Leaders of political parties in the Netherlands Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands Category:Politicians from Zeeland Category:Prime ministers of the Netherlands",
