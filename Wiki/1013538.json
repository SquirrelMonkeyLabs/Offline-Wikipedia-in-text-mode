 "text": "Badenweiler is a municipality and a spa town in Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The Evangelical church in Badenweiler was built in 1897 at the base of an old 11th-century castle that once belonged to the margraves of Baden. The castle was destroyed by the French during the wars of Louis XV. Badenweiler is popular for its warm mineral springs (21 °C or 70 °F), whey cures, mild climate, and beautiful scenery. It has a spa center (Kurhaus), a 15-acre park with a historic arboretum, and a grand-ducal castle. In 1784, well-preserved Roman baths were discovered in the town. == References == == Other websites == * Badenweiler * Roman Thermae Category:Spa towns in Germany Category:Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald",
