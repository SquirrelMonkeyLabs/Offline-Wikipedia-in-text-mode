 "text": "A baseball doughnut is a piece of equipment used in baseball to help players warm up before they hit. It is a round weight that looks like a doughnut and fits around the barrel of a baseball bat. The doughnut adds extra weight to the bat, making it heavier. Players use the doughnut in the on-deck circle, which is where they get ready to bat. Swinging a bat with a doughnut can make the regular bat feel lighter when the doughnut is taken off, which may help the batter swing faster. Baseball doughnuts are usually made of metal or hard rubber. They are safe to use as long as they fit tightly and do not slide on the bat. History The baseball doughnut was invented in the 1960s. It was created to help players warm up more effectively before hitting. The idea was that swinging a heavier bat would make the regular bat feel lighter and easier to swing during the game. One of the first popular versions of the doughnut was made by a company called Hillerich & Bradsby, the makers of Louisville Slugger bats. The doughnut quickly became popular in professional baseball and was later used in high school and youth leagues. Over time, different types of warm-up weights were made, but the doughnut shape remained one of the most common.",
