 "text": "The Paris Peace Accords was a peace treaty signed on January 27, 1973. It was planned to end the Vietnam War and restore peace in Vietnam. Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts. Lê Đức Thọ did not want it because there was not any peace. The agreement's rules were broken by both North and South Vietnamese forces. Two years later, this led to North Vietnam taking Saigon, then combined it into Modern Day Vietnam. ==References== Category:Vietnam War Category:1970s treaties",
