It has the chemical formula CH3CH(NH2)COOH. The L-isomer is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the genetic code. Its codons are GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG. It is classified as a non-polar amino acid.Non- polar: electrons shared so that there is no difference in electric charge between different parts of the molecule. L-Alanine accounts for 7.8% of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins.Primary structure: the exact specification of its atomic structure and its chemical bonds. Leucine is the only amino acid which is more common. D-Alanine occurs in bacterial cell walls and in some peptide antibiotics. == References == Category:Amino acids",
