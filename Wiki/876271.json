 "text": "Milton County, Georgia was a county in the U.S. state of Georgia that existed between 1857 and 1931. The county's capital was Alpharetta. In 1931, Milton County was merged with Fulton County in order to save it from bankruptcy during the Great Depression. Campbell County, located 50 miles to the south, suffered the same fate. During the 2000s, residents of northern Fulton county expressed their desire to recreate Milton County, out of both economical and social reasons. A bill was brought to the Georgia state legislature, however it was rejected because Georgia's constitution prohibits the creation of more than 159 counties in the state.
