 "text": "Seurat painted for a time with the Impressionist painters, Claude Monet, Renoir, Sisley and Pissarro. His scientific ideas about color then led him to develop a different painting technique. He painted in tiny dots of color, with the theory that the viewer's eye would mix them. This technique is called \"pointillism\". Seurat and his followers are often referred to as the Neo- Impressionists (\"New Impressionists\"). His most famous paintings are A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (18841886) in the Chicago Art Institute and Bathers at Asni√®res (1884) in the National Gallery, London.Art Institute of Chicagohe died in 1958 == Related pages == * Impressionism * Post-impressionism * Expressionism * Pointillism == References == Category:1859 births Category:1891 deaths Category:French painters",
