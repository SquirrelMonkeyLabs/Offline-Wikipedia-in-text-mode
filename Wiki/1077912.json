 "text": "A jet pack is a device that allows a single person to fly short distances. The device is also called jetpack, rocket belt, rocket pack or flight pack. The idea has been present in science fiction literature for over a cerntory. First prototypes, and working devices have been built from about the 1960s. There are a few different designs. Despite this, their use is limited. The main drawbacks come from things like the Earth's athmosphere gravity and the human body not being adapted to flight, Also, special fuels need to be used. These fuels are hazardous to handle. For this reason, jetpacks are mainly used for stunts today. In space, things are different: there is very little friction, and very little to no athmosphere. A special combination of a jetpack and a spacesuit is used if astronauts need to do things outside their spaceship. This comination is called jet suit. As of 2024, technology usually allows for 20-30 seconds of flight (some models: up to 9-10 minutes). They are also inefficient, with a hight fuel consumption, and loud. Category:Aircraft",
