Yorkshire Sheet 143, 6\" = 1 mile, surveyed:1850â€“51, published:1854M.Aston, Interpreting the Landscape: Landscape Archaeology and Local History (1985), p.67 It has been settled since prehistory, but was largest during the 10th through 12th centuries. The Domesday Book talks about it, and says that it was called 'Warran' or 'Warron'. It was owned by the Percy family of aristocrats. Around the year 1400, it came under the ownership of the Hylton family of aristocrats. They decided to use the land in and around the village for sheep, because it made more money back then. In the early 16th century, the last part of the village was destroyed to make room for sheep pasture.J. M.
