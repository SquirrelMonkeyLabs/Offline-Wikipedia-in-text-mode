The highest mountain is named Kamakou, and it is 4,970 feet (1,514 meters) high. Molokaʻi has many local indigenous names including Molokaʻi 'Aina Momona (land of abundance), Molokaʻi Pule O'o (land of powerful prayer), and Molokaʻi Nui A Hina (of the goddess Hina). It is one of the least developed of the Hawaiian islands. The only big town is named Kaunakakai, which is also the main or chief port on the island. The airport is in Central Molokai. Also on the island is Kalaupapa, which is a place for people who have a disease called leprosy. Molokai has many Hawaiian fish ponds along its south shore. Many of these have been cleaned and fixed.
