He developed a passion for music at a young age and became skilled at playing the guitar and writing songs while in school. At 12 years old, he started taking guitar lessons. In 1986, at the age of 17, Parker released his first album, \"Reflections of Tomorrow\". Four years later, in 1990, he worked with Peter Pendras, the guitarist of the country band Wild Choir, to release his second album, \"Through The Darkness\". In 2007, Parker worked with musician Barb Heller to release his fourth album, \"Now & Then\". In 2022, he released \"Every Passing Mile\" in collaboration with musician Phil Hurley under SubCat Records. The album consisted of 13 songs, most of which were written by Parker. It also included the opening track \"Cast a Line\", which he co-wrote with Peter Pendras during the initial period of the COVID-19 lockdown. That same year, Parker released his sixth album, \"Best Kept Secret\", which featured previously unreleased material spanning two decades. In 2023, he released his seventh album, \"Sweethearts: A Tribute To The Byrds 'Sweetheart of the Rodeo'\". This album showcased Parker's modern country interpretations of all 11 tracks from the original 1968 album by the American folk rock band The Byrds. In addition to the original songs, Parker included three more tracks on the album: \"I Still Miss Something\" by Johnny Cash, \"Satisfied Mind\" by Joe Hayes and Jack Rhodes, and \"Drugstore Truck Driving Man\" by Roger McGuinn and Gram Parsons. Parker said that the album is \"our tribute to the 1968 classic\". Notably, Earl Poole Ball, who played on the original 1968 album, is also featured as a co-artist on this rendition. Furthermore, Ball and Parker collaborated as producers for the record. Another notable contributor to the 2023 \"Sweethearts\" album is JayDee Maness, who also participated in the original 1968 recording. The album's production began in May 2022 and continued in the fall, with additional musicians joining the recording in January 2023. The second volume of the Byrds tribute album, titled \"Change is Now\", is set to be released in early 2024. ==Discography== ===Albums=== Year Title 1986 Reflections of Tomorrow 1990 Through The Darkness 1991 Wonderland 2007 Now & Then 2022 Every Passing Mile Best Kept Secret 2023 Sweethearts: A Tribute To The Byrds 'Sweetheart of the Rodeo' 2024 Change is Now ===Singles and EPs=== Year Title 2021 Cast A Line Every Passing Mile 2022 Road To Recovery Weight Of The World Diamond Sailor 2023 You Ainâ€™t Going Nowhere Forever Man Innocent Eyes Spirit Of The Trees Drug Store Truck Driving Man Hickory Wind: Byrds Tribute ==Awards and nominations== ===As a solo artist=== Year Nominated work Award Category Notes Result 2023 Every Passing Mile Syracuse Area Music Awards Best Americana ===As a member of Waydown Wailers=== Year Nominated work Award Category Notes Result 2016 Empty Promises Grammy Award Best Americana Album Jealousy Best Americana Roots Song Susie Q Best Americana Roots Performance ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American musicians Category:21st- century American musicians",
