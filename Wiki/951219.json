He stopped drinking alcohol. Handsome Lake claimed that he got a revelation from spirits. The religious movement combines Iroquois and Christian elements. Handsome Lake said Natives should avoid adultery, drunkenness, laziness, and witchcraft. European colonies and disease had caused Natives to have social unrest and division. Natives welcomed this new religious movement. The Code of Handsome Lake was published in 1850.Wallace, Anthony F. C., 1923- (1972). The death and rebirth of the Seneca. Steen, Sheila C.
