 "text": "Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American politician and a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California.Cone, Russ (January 8, 1978). \"Feinstein Board President\", The San Francisco Examiner, p. 1. He did not focus on homosexuality or gay activism at first, but did later on in his career. Milk moved from New York City to live in San Francisco in 1972. This was a time when lots of gay men moved to live in the Castro District of San Francisco. Milk became a city supervisor in 1977. == Life == Milk became an icon in San Francisco and \"a martyr for gay rights\", according to University of San Francisco professor Peter Novak.Nolte, Carl (November 26, 2003). \"City Hall Slayings: 25 Years Later\", The San Francisco Chronicle, p. A-1. == Death == On November 27, 1978, he and Mayor George Moscone were shot and killed by Dan White in San Francisco. White was another city supervisor who had recently resigned but wanted his job back. October 21, 1985, White committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage less than two years after his release from prison. == Aftermath == In 2002, Milk was called \"the most famous and most significantly open LGBT official ever elected in the United States\".Smith, Raymond, Haider-Markel, Donald, eds., (2002). Gay and Lesbian Americans and Political Participation, ABC-CLIO. , p. 204. Anne Kronenberg, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: \"What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us.\"Leyland, Winston, ed (2002). Out In the Castro: Desire, Promise, Activism, Leyland Publications. , p. 37. Milk was posthumously given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama on August 12, 2009. Popular quotes include \"If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door\", \"The fact is that more people have been slaughtered in the name of religion than for any other single reason. That, that my friends, that is true perversion!\". There has been some controversy about Milk’s relation to Jim Jones, a cult leader who led the communist Peoples Temple and resulted in the deaths of over 900 people. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:1978 deaths Category:American LGBT rights activists Category:Assassinated American politicians Category:Gay Jews Category:Jewish activists Category:Jewish American LGBT people Category:Jewish American politicians Category:LGBT people from California Category:American LGBT politicians Category:Murders by firearm in the United States Category:Politicians from New York (state) Category:Politicians from San Francisco Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Victims of anti-LGBT hate crimes",
