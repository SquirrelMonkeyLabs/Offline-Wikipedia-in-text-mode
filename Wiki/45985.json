 "text": "Aspirin (also known as acetylsalicylic acid) is a drug. It is most commonly used as a painkiller and to treat headaches, toothache, and period pain. It is also used to reduce fever, flu-like symptoms or colds, and inflammation. It usually starts working 20-30 minutes after taking it. It has an anti-platelet effect, which means it reduces the number of platelets in the blood, which in turn reduces blood clotting. Because of this, it is used to treat heart attacks. Low-dose aspirin is sometimes prescribed to people who are at a greater risk of heart attacks or stroke Aspirin is one of the most-used medical drugs in the world and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines Humans (children) under 16 (used to be 12 and then 14) can develop Reye's syndrome from using aspirin. This causes the liver to become fatty and not work properly. The brain may also become enlarged. Reye's syndrome can be fatal or lead to permanent brain damage, but most children survive with treatment. There are possible side-effects to this drug. For example, large amounts can damage the kidneys. People with lung, kidney disease, gout, hyperuricemia (high amounts of uric acid in the blood), hemophilia, diabetes, or high blood pressure should not take aspirin except on the advice of a qualified medical professional. People who are allergic to aspirin, or to ibuprofen or naproxen should not take aspirin. People with asthma, where attacks are brought about by aspirin, should avoid using any anti-inflammatory drugs based on it. Aspirin was invented in Germany in 1897. Bayer has a trademark on the brand name \"aspirin\" in 80 countries. But in other countries, \"aspirin\" is the common name for the drug. == Related pages == * Acetaminophen (Tylenol, paracetamol) * ibuprofen ==References== Category:Analgesics Category:Carboxylic acids",
