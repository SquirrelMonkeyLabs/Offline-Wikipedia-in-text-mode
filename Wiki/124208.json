 "text": "K-9 and Company was a 1981 television spin-off of the original series of Doctor Who. It featured Sarah Jane Smith, played by Elisabeth Sladen, and K-9(mark 3), a robotic dog. Both characters had been companions of the Fourth Doctor, but they had not appeared together before, Sarah Jane Smith gained a companion/assistant of her own in the show: her aunt's ward Brendan Richards, played by Ian Sears. A single episode, “A Girl's Best Friend”, was produced, but the series was not taken up, although it would form the basis for Sarah Jane Smith's and K-9's later appearances together in “the five doctors”, “school reunion” and the successful spinoff: “The Sarah Jane adventures”. The show's theme music was composed by long-term Doctor Who enthusiast and record producer Ian Levine. Category:Doctor Who Category:1981 British television series debuts",
