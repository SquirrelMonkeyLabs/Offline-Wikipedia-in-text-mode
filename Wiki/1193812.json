 "text": "The Kern arc is a rare optical phenomenon, a faint white circle around the zenith that is part of the ice crystal halos family. It's considered an extremely rare occurrence, looking like a complete circle centred on the zenith, unlike the more common circumzenithal arc which is only a partial arc. The Kern arc is caused by the refraction of sunlight through specific ice crystal shapes, which is so rare, it has been photographed only once.",
