 "text": "Stubbs (April 12, 1997 - July 21, 2017) was an American cat who was the mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska from July 1997 until his death in July 2017. Until early 2017, Stubbs was still mayor, and has been described as a tourist attraction. At least one opinion writer for the Alaska Dispatch News insisted that the whole story was false, and that Talkeetna, Alaska, did not, in fact, have a cat mayor. According to NPR, the cat could not have been elected as a write-in candidate because \"the tiny town has no real mayor, so there was no election.\" Stubbs died on July 21, 2017 in Talkeetna at the age of 20 years.Stubbs, Talkeetnaâ€™s honorary cat mayor, dies , by Chris Klint, at KTVA; published July 23, 2017; retrieved July 23, 2017 ==References== Category:1997 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Individual cats Category:American mayors Category:History of Alaska",
