The adult male frog is 33.7–43.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 33.7–50.0 mm long. The adult male frog has thick, strong front legs and bony spines on its body. But it does not have the nuptial pad on its front feet the way some other adult male frogs do. This frog's head and back are light brown with light green marks. The throat is yellow-green in color. The belly is white in color and its feet are gray. The iris of the eye is light brown or pink with black marks. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
