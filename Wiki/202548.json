 "text": "\"Love's Philosophy\" is a poem written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1820. ==Original text== The fountains mingle with the river And the rivers with the Ocean, The winds of Heaven mix for ever With a sweet emotion; Nothing in the world is single; All things by a law divine in one spirit meet and mingle. Why not I with thine?-- See the mountains kiss high Heaven And the waves clasp one another; No sister-flower would be forgiven If it disdained its brother; And the sunlight clasps the earth And the moonbeams kiss the sea: What is all this sweet work worth If thou kiss not me?
