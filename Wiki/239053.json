 "text": "The Modern defence is a chess opening. It is almost the only defence which can be played against any opening move; and it may be played as an opening move itself. It consists in the immediate fianchetto of the king's bishop (KB). The first moves might be: :1.e4 g6 :2.d4 Bg7 The opening is hypermodern. Instead of occupying the center, Black counter-attacks the center built up by White. The system is extremely flexible, and there are many transpositions.Transpositions arrive at the same position from different move orders. There are players, including a few grandmasters, who play almost nothing but the Modern with white and black.Keene R. & Botterill G. 2003. The modern defence.
