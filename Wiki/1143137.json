They are in the northern end of the Cordillera Occidental (West Andes) mountains in Colombia. ==Geography== The Paramillo Massif is in Ituango and Peque in Antioquia Department and in Puerto Libertador and Tierralta in Córdoba Department. The places around the massif are Chigorodó, Mutatá, Tarazá, Cáceres, and Caucasia in Antioquia. People can see other big mountains from the massif. These mountains are in in the Sierra Nevada, and Pico Simón Bolívar 5,700 m (18,700 ft) is one of them. Pico Simón Bolívar is about 500 km (310 mi) away. This could be the longest distance people can seen between any two places on the surface of the Earth. ===Subranges=== There are three smaller groups of mountains in this group: *The Abibe Mountains (Serranía de Abibe) act like a wall between the Antioquia Department and Córdoba Department. *The San Jerónimo Mountains (Serranía de San Jerónimo) are between the places where water flows into the San Jorge River or into the Sinú River. *The Ayapel Mountains (Serranía de Ayapel) are between the places where water flows into the San Jorge River or Cauca Rivers. They also act like a wall between Antioquia and Córdoba Departments. ===Paramillo Natural National Park=== Most of the massif is inside Paramillo Natural National Park. The park is from the massif to the lowlands of the Caribbean Plain. The park has Tropical Andes places for living things to live, for example páramo grasslands and mountain forests. This is one of two places where the bird Paramillo tapaculo (Scytalopus canus) lives. The spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) lives in the massif. == References == Category:Mountain ranges Category:Colombia",
