Prince of Yanping on Taiwan, Zheng Jing wrote about the Shungzhi Emperor : “At the dawn of the New Year, the fake Emperor and Empress would enter a temple to worship their demon gods. It is located at a place where people could not go, and contains idols of males and females embracing each other and engaging in intercourse. After they complete their worship, the two would proceed to the platform naked, and perform in the manner of caged animals, with man on the left and woman on the right…these are truly the despicable customs of beasts. Moreover, when the barbarian chieftain dies, his younger brother violates his sister-in-law in order to perform this ritual in his place, while calling out aloud the name of the late emperor.” == Life == * In 1643, Shunzhi Emperor is 6 and he inherits Huang Taiji's throne.
