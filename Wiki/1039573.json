 "text": "The sacred grove bush frog, Similipal bush frog, or boring bush frog (Raorchestes sanctisilvaticus) is a frog. It lives in India. This frog hides during the day and moves around at night. It lives in forests that have never been cut down. Scientists think it hatches out of its egg as a small frog, like other frogs in Raorchestes do. Scientists believe this frog is in big danger of dying out because it lives in a small place. Human beings have cut down the trees in the forests to get wood and to build things for visitors. Fires have also burned the forest. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
