 "text": "Kinect Star Wars is an action video game. It was both published by both LucasArts and Microsoft Studios and it was developed by Terminal Reality. The game was released on April 3, 2012 only for the Kinect and the Xbox 360. In the game, the player takes the role of a Padawan. The player uses their hands and use motion to take control of a lightsaber and fight enemies. The Force is also Blue to be used in the game. There is also a mode where the player can race in Podraces and a mode where they can dance. ==Reception== The game recieved negative reviews from game critics. Critics said that they liked the art and said that the game utilized the best use of the Kinect in an action game for not having to repeat moves to make the actions work in-game. However, critics didn't like the lightsaber fights or the dance moss, with Han Solo dancing to \"I'm Han Solo\", a parody of the 2010 Jason Derulo song \"Ridin' Solo\" gaining most critique. It is often named as one of the worst Star Wars games ever made. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2012 video games Category:Star Wars games Category:LucasArts games Category:Action video games Category:Pack-in video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360-only games",
