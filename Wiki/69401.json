 "text": "The Ottoman dynasty () (or the Imperial House of Osman) ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1299 to 1922. The dynasty began with Osman I, but it was not recognized until 1383 when Murad I declared himself sultan. The dynasty might have been known as Söğüt before 1383, but it was later renamed Osmanli (Ottoman in English) in honor of Osman I. The sultan was the sole ruler of the empire. The power often shifted to other officials, such as the Grand Vizier. ==Heads of the House of Osman== ===Pre-Imperial Heads of the House of Osman=== Name Born-Died Reign start Reign end Relationship Süleyman Shah (Bey) 1168 - 1227 1212 1227 Son of Kaya Alp Ertugrul (Bey) 1198 - 1281 1227 1281 Son of Suleyman Shah ===Imperial heads of the House of Osman (1281-1922)=== Name Born-Died Reign start Reign end Relationship Osman I (Bey) 1258 – 1326 1281 1326 Son of Ertugrul Orhan I (Bey) 1284 – 1359 1326 1359 Son of Osman I Murad I (the God-like One) 1326 - 1389 Bey from 1359, Sultan from 1383 28 June 1389 Son of Orhan I Bayezid I (the Thunderbolt) 1354 - 1403 28 June 1389 20 July 1402 Son of Murat I Ottoman Interregnum 1402 1413 Mehmed I (Celebi) 1389 - 1421 1413 26 May 1421 Son of Bayezid I Murad II (first reign) 1404 - 1451 26 May 1421 August 1444 (abdicated) Son of Mehmed I Mehmed II (the Conqueror) (first reign) 1432 - 1481 August 1444 1446 Son of Murad II Murad II (second reign) 1404 - 1451 1446 3 February 1451 Son of Mehmed I Mehmed II (the Conqueror) (second reign) 1432 - 1481 3 February 1451 3 May 1481 Son of Murad II Bayezid II 1447/1448 - 1512 20 May 1481 25 April 1512 (abdicated) Son of Mehmed II Selim I (the Grim) 1465 - 1520 25 April 1512 (Caliph from 1517) 22 September 1520 Son of Bayezid II Suleyman I (the Magnificent) 1494 - 1566 22 September 1520 6 September 1566 Son of Selim I Selim II 1524 - 1574 6 September 1566 12 December 1574 Son of Suleyman I Murad III 1546 - 1595 12 December 1574 15 January 1595 Son of Selim II Mehmed III 1566 - 1603 15 January 1595 22 December 1603 Son of Murad III Ahmed I 1590 - 1617 22 December 1603 22 November 1617 Son of Mehmed III Mustafa I (first reign) 1592 - 1639 22 November 1617 26 February 1618 (deposed) Son of Mehmed III Osman II 1604 - 1622 26 February 1618 20 May 1622 Son of Ahmed I Mustafa I (second reign) 1592 - 1639 20 May 1622 10 September 1623 (deposed) Son of Mehmed III Murad IV 1612 - 1640 10 September 1623 9 February 1640 Son of Ahmed I Ibrahim I (the Mad) 1615 - 1648 9 February 1640 8 August 1648 (deposed) Son of Ahmed I Mehmed IV 1642 - 1693 8 August 1648 8 November 1687 (deposed) Son of Ibrahim I Suleyman II 1642 - 1691 8 November 1687 23 June 1691 Son of Ibrahim I Ahmed II 1643 - 1695 23 June 1691 6 February 1695 Son of Ibrahim I Mustafa II 1664 - 1703 6 February 1695 22 August 1703 (abdicated) Son of Mehmed IV Ahmed III 1673 - 1736 22 August 1703 1 October 1730 (abdicated) Son of Mehmed IV Mahmud I 1696 - 1754 2 October 1730 13 December 1754 Son of Mustafa II Osman III 1699 - 1757 14 December 1754 30 October 1757 Son of Mustafa II Mustafa III 1717 - 1774 30 October 1757 21 January 1774 Son of Ahmed III Abdul Hamid I 1725 - 1789 21 January 1774 7 April 1789 Son of Ahmed III Selim III 1761 - 1808 7 April 1789 29 May 1807 (deposed) Son of Mustafa III Mustafa IV 1779 - 1808 29 May 1807 28 July 1808 (deposed) Son of Abdul Hamid I Mahmud II 1785 - 1839 28 July 1808 1 July 1839 Son of Abdul Hamid I Abdulmecid I 1823 - 1861 1 July 1839 25 June 1861 Son of Mahmud II Abdulaziz 1830 - 1876 25 June 1861 30 May 1876 (deposed) Son of Mahmud II Murad V 1840 - 1904 30 May 1876 31 August 1876 (deposed) Son of Abdulmecid I Abdul Hamid II 1842 - 1918 31 August 1876 27 April 1909 (deposed) Son of Abdulmecid I Mehmed V (Reşad) 1844 - 1918 27 April 1909 3 July 1918 Son of Abdulmecid I Mehmed VI (Vahideddin) 1861 - 1926 3 July 1918 1 November 1922 (deposed) Son of Abdulmecid I ===Post-Imperial Heads of the House of Osman (1922-present)=== Name Born-Died Reign start Reign end Abdulmecid II 1868 - 1944 19 November 1922 23 August 1944 Ahmed IV Nihad 1883 - 1954 23 August 1944 4 June 1954 Osman IV Fuad 1895 - 1973 4 June 1954 19 May 1973 Mehmed Abdulaziz II 1901 - 1977 19 May 1973 19 January 1977 Ali Vâsib 1903 - 1983 19 January 1977 9 December 1983 Mehmed VII Orhan 1909 - 1994 9 December 1983 12 March 1994 Ertuğrul Osman V 1912 - 2009 12 March 1994 23 September 2009 Bayezid Osman 1924 - 2017 23 September 2009 6 January 2017 Dündar Ali Osman 1930 - 2021 6 January 2017 18 January 2021 Harun Osman 1932 - 18 January 2021 present == Expelled from the Imperial House == *(Şehzade) Mahmud Şevket (Efendi Hazretleri) (1903, Istanbul - 1973, France) was expelled and deprived of the title of Prince and the style of His Highness from the Imperial House of Osman by His Imperial Majesty, the last Caliph Abdülmecid II. in 1931.
