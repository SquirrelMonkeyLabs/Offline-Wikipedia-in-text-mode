 "text": "Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024), is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court found that presidential immunity from criminal prosecution protects all of a president's \"official acts\"with absolute immunity for official acts while they were president and that Congress cannot control such as the pardon or control of the executive branch. This case happened because of the ongoing federal case to see whether then-President Donald Trump who took part in election interference during the 2020 election, including events during the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. It is the first time a case about criminal prosecution for alleged official acts of a president was brought before the Supreme Court. On July 1, 2024, the Court ruled in a 6â€“3 decision that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed as president. ==References== Category:Donald Trump Category:2021 United States Capitol attack Category:2020 United States presidential election Category:United States Supreme Court cases",
