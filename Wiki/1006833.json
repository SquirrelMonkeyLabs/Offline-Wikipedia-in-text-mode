 "text": "The Omei tree frog or Omei whipping frog (Zhangixalus omeimontis) is a frog. It lives in China. It lives in Sichuan Province, Yunnan Province, Hubei Province, and Guangxi Province. The adult frog mostly lives on the ground. People see these frogs in bamboo forests in low places and on hills. Sometimes people see them on farms. The female frog lays eggs on laves over still water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. People have seen this frog between 700 and 2000 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. This place has protected parks in it. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
