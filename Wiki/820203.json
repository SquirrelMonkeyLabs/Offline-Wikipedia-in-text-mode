The Khamlangba Thenlon text mentions about his skills of iron metallurgy and blacksmith in ancient Kakching kingdom. == Description == God Khamlangba is the miner of iron ores and the manufacturer of steel. He is worshipped for peace and prosperity in the kingdom. He is revered for protecting people from diseases and death. He drives away the evil spirits from the state. He belongs to the class of Sylvan Gods (Umang Lais). The Kangjeirol text mentions that God Khamlangba was one of the divine polo players who played the divine polo match of the gods. == Mythology == In the creation myth, God Khamlangba was grown out of Atiya Sidaba. He was a great hunter, warrior and miner. He lived with Goddess Huimu Leima and a son named Amudon was born to them. After this, Khamlangba left Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur) for Tripura () in search of iron ores. When he returned to Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur), he settled in Kakching. The people of Kakching worshipped Him. Later, \"Kakching Haraoba\", a new form of Lai Haraoba was developed. This account is evident in the Khamlangba Khunggumlon text. In another legend, God Khamlangba stayed for some time at a place named \"Khuman Heiyel Loubuk\". Later, he came to Kheraching. A person named Nganba Tekcha Pamba Laihat Thouba beheaded Irum Lai Tubi Kokling Lengba. So, the place where God Khamlangba stayed was later known as Kakching Khullen and Kakching Wairi. God Khamlangba participated in the divine polo match played among the gods. The divine polo match took place during the reign of the deified Meetei King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba as described in the Kangjeirol text. He was one of the 7 polo players in the northern team. His team was led by God Marjing. On the other hand, his opponent's team (southern team) was led by God Thangjing. == Cults and shrines == God Khamlangba holds a special position for the Kakching Haraoba.
