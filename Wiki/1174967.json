 "text": "The Argentine National Gendarmerie (GNA), sometimes referred to as the National Gendarmerie (GN), is one of the Federal Security Forces of Argentina (along with the Argentine Naval Prefecture, the Argentine Federal Police, the Airport Security Police, and the Federal Penitentiary Service). It is a military force with internal security functions. It was created on July 28, 1938, and historically was under the control of the Argentine Army. It was involved in numerous armed conflicts, including its participation in the 1982 Malvinas War. It is currently under the control of the National Executive Power, through the Ministry of Security. In 2019, it administered 2,300 units and checkpoints; 3,505 transport, support, and operational vehicles; 764 horses and mules; 358 security, anti-narcotics, and rescue dogs; along with 25 aircraft. The total number of officers was not officially reported in the Institutional Public Report for that year. ==History== The gendarmerie was created in 1938 by the National Congress and replaced the regiments of the Army which previously fulfilled the gendarmerie's missions. The gendarmerie was particularly tasked with providing security in isolated and sparsely populated frontier regions which had only been settled relatively recently. In many senses the gendarmerie may still be considered an adjunct of the Argentine Army. ==Personnel and training== Non-commissioned personnel of the gendarmerie are all volunteers and receive their training in the force's own comprehensive system of training institutions. Officers graduate after a three-year course at the National Gendarmerie Academy. Both officers and non- commissioned personnel have access to the specialist training establishments of the Army. ==References==",
