 "text": "Hyloxalus fascianigrus is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== Scientists have seen this frog on the ground in dead leaves near streams. They have seen the frog in cloud forests that have never been cut down and in forests that were gone and are growing back. Scientists have not seen this frog anywhere but in forests. Scientists saw this frog between 1470 and 1960 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in protected parks, for example Munchique National Park, Los Farallones de Cali National Park, and Rio Anchicaya Forest Reserve. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries them to water in streams or pools. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. They think there are between 250 and 1000 adult frogs alive, in 2017. They think many frogs died from the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. People also change the places where the frog lives to make farms and to make places for cows to eat grass. Some of the farms are legal in Colombia, but others are against the law. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
