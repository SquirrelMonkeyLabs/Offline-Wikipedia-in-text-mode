 "text": "Particle board, also known as particleboard and chipboard, is a wood product made from chips of wood or sawdust. It is mixed with resin or glue (both adhesives), then, under pressure and heat, pressed into uniform sheets.Structural Design in Wood, eds. Judith J. Stalnaker, Ernest C. Harris (New York: Chapman & Hall, 1997), p. 265 Particle board is used in building construction and furniture making. It is cheaper to make than plywood but not as strong. Type 1 particle board expands when exposed to moisture. For that reason it is not usually recommended to be used outdoors.R. Bruce Hoadley, Understanding Wood: A Craftsman's Guide to Wood Technology (Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2000), p. 235 Type 2 particle board uses waterproof glues and can be used outdoors. ==References== ==Related pages== * Plywood * Engineered wood * Oriented strand board * Waferboard ==Other websites== * Composite Panel Association: Particleboard * European Panel Federation: Particleboard Category:Wood",
