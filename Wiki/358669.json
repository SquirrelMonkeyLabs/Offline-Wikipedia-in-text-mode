 "text": "Sleep hygiene is a set of practices and changes in behavior that make it easier to get restful sleep. Nathaniel Kleitman first used the term, in 1939. A book by psychologist Peter Hauri introduced the concept within the context of modern sleep medicine.de Biase et al. Sleep Hygiene. Chapter 27 in Sleepiness and human impact assessment. Eds. Garborino LN et al. Springer Milan, 2014. Sleep hygiene was developed as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia. Sleep hygiene recommendations include setting up a sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime, reducing stress, reducing nighttime activity, and limiting bed use if not sleeping, to name a few. Other recommendations include avoiding alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime, and having a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment. Doctors study the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment. ==References== Category:Sleep",
