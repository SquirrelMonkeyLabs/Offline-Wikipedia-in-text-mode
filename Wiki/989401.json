 "text": "The Tagblatt-Pokal (Tagblatt-Cup) was an annual Viennese league football championship. It was the first of its kind in Austria. It was held three times between 1900 and 1903 and won by Wiener AC each time. It is considered the forerunner of today's Bundesliga in Austria. ==History== The Tagblatt Cup was started in 1900 by the well-known Viennese daily newspaper \"Neues Wiener Tagblatt\" and was only open to Viennese clubs. The Tagblatt Cup consisted of two league classes. In the top division, the 1st class, five teams played. In the first year they were only four . The rest was divided into the 2nd classes A and B. The winners of these classes played for the Tagblatt Cup the next year. The last two of the 1st class had to be relegated to the 2nd class.This rule has not been applied regularly for various reasons. For example in the last season a relegation was played. The end of the Tagblatt Cup finally came in the fourth season as several teams left the association. ==1900/1901== Pl. Team R V D L Goals Diff. Points 1\\. Wiener AC 12 7 2 3 26-15 16 2\\.
