 "text": "The Ten Days of Repentance (, aseret yemay teshuva) is a time of year when Jews focus on prayer and repentance. The ten days begin with the holiday of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and end with the fast of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. Because of the importance of repentance, the two holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are often called the High Holy Days or High Holidays (ימים נוראים, yamim nora'im, \"Days of Awe\").
