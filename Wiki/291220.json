 "text": "A traveler's cheque (also traveller's cheque, travellers cheque, traveller's check or traveler's check) is a preprinted cheque for a fixed amount. The person who buys it must sign it and then sign it again when he \"cashes\" it. It is a good way for a traveller to take money when going on holiday. If a traveler's cheque is stolen it can be replaced so long as the person still has a receipt to prove that he bought it. Traveler's cheques were a large part of the business of American Express. Since 2005 the American Express have been issuing \"American Express Travelers Cheque Cards\". These can be used in stores like a credit card. ==Other websites== * American Express Traveler's Cheques merchant site Category:Money",
