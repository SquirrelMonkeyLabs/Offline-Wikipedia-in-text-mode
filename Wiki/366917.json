 "text": "The State of Judea (, ) is a proposed halachic state in the West Bank. The idea was put forward by Israeli Jewish settlers. ==Flag== The flag of Judea is nearly the same as the flag of Israel. Like the flag of Israel, it has a blue symbol on a white background, between two horizontal blue stripes, but unlike the flag of Israel the symbol is a Temple menorah instead of a Star of David. Another version has a Star of David of a different sort than appears on the flag of Israel, together with some other symbols. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Judaism in Israel Category:Politics of Israel Category:Politics of Palestine Category:Arabâ€“Israeli conflict Category:West Bank Category:Kahanism",
