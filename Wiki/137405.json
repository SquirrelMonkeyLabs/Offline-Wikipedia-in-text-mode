 "text": "The Pantanal is the world's largest wetland or swamp. It covers a region of 140,000 km2, larger than the area covered by the country Greece. The Pantanal is in South America and shared by Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. There are many threats to the Pantanal such as pollution, mercury from gold mining and ranching. Although the Pantanal can wash some of the chemicals away, the increased amount is becoming a concern. In winter nearly 80% of the area is flooded. == References == Category:Geography of Bolivia Category:Geography of Brazil Category:Biosphere reserves Category:Wetlands Category:Ecoregions Category:Geography of Paraguay",
