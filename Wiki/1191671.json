The club was originally known as Seeduwa/Raddoluwa Cricket Club until, in 2011, it became the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Cricket Club (SLPACC). The SLPA withdrew sponsorship in October 2020, and the club was renamed Ace Capital ahead of the 2020–21 season. The team now has first-class status, and competes in the Major League Tournament.
