 "text": "Antihydrogen is an atom made of antimatter. Like normal matter, antihydrogen can bond and form molecules with other antimatter. (It would annihilate any normal matter that it touches). Antihydrogen has one positron–which is positively charged–orbiting an antiproton, which is negatively charged. This is opposite normal hydrogen, which has one negatively charged electron orbiting a positively charged proton. \"Antihydrogen\" can also refer to the molecule called Antihydrogen, which is made of two bonded antiprotons.
