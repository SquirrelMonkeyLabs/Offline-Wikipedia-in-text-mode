It was when the father of an eight-year old Mika enrolled him in primary music school Stanković where he was first taught to play the piano. The year 1942 was crucial in his life because, upon hearing the sound of the clarinet through Radio London, he realized that this was what he wanted. And since then, fascinated by the beauty of jazz, he had regularly visited Concert Hall in Belgrade and listened to jazz concerts of then our masters (Elija Genić, Mladen Guteša, Vojin Popović and others), as well as of the foreign performers (Kari Burnett, German singer). He attended the Third Male Grammar School and Secondary Music School \"Stankovic\", the piano department. He then enrolled at the Faculty of Sciences in Belgrade, department of chemistry, and left it for the music before graduation. ===After WW2 === After the war, in 1945, Mihailo continued to learn the piano in Secondary Music School „Stanković“. The biggest turning point in his life happened in 1946. This was when he saw and bought his first clarinet in a consignment shop. Since he had knowledge of music, he began to practice day and night, this time – clarinet. At the age of eighteen, inspired by the music of Glenn Miller and Woody Herman Orchestra, he made a firm decision to devote his life to the clarinet and music and graduated the clarinet from Secondary Music School “Slavenski” in the class of professor Franjo Partlić. ==Early works== === Work with the orchestra Fis-dur === Jazz was very appealing to Mihailo Živanović.

Only Sodermajer and Živanović remained of the old members. Important meeting with Boro Roković (a trumpeter, composer, arranger, pianist and accordionist) occurred while playing at a dance party in 1949. Bora heard him and was impressed by his talent. He wanted to help Mihajlo, introduce him more and better into the world of jazz and direct him to the true value. He offered him to join his orchestra. Živanović played there until the end of 1953. Soon he was invited by Aleksandar Nećak. He played in all three orchestras at the same time.
