 "text": "The book of Jasher is an old book that is only mentioned twice in the Hebrew Bible and was not preserved. This book is mentioned in Joshua 10:13 and it possibly had stories of a celebration of the lives of Israelite heros (2 Samuel 1:18). The Book of Jasher, also referred to as the Book of Just Ones, is believed to be a lost text in its original form. While several translations exist, including a demonstrably inaccurate one from the 18th century, the authenticity of these translations in reflecting the original work remains uncertain. ==References== Category:Books",
