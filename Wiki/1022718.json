 "text": "In aviation, a mid-air collision is an accident in which two or more aircraft touch each other during flight. This will cause a lot of damage to the aircraft due to either the collision or an impact after to the ground or water. The potential for a collision goes up due to miscommunication, mistrust, error in navigation, not following the flight plans, and the lack of awareness. Although a rare occurrence in general due to the amount of open space available the collisions often happen near or at airports, where a lot of aircraft will be closer together than in flight. ==References== Category:Aircraft",
