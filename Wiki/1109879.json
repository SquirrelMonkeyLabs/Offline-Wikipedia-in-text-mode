He began his career as a solo artist in the 1960s, under the name P.P. Jones, and performed in clubs with Brian Jones, who was later in The Rolling Stones. He sang in the same club as Jones, Mick Jagger, and Keith Richards. At one point, Jones was asked by Jones and Richards to be the singer for a band they were making, but Jones declined.Paul Jones on Blues Britannia, BBC4, 11 March 2011 In 1962, he was asked to join a Blues group that had just been formed by Manfred Mann and Mike Hugg. This band would later be known as Manfred Mann. They had three songs that went to number one in the UK: \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\", \"Pretty Flamingo\", and \"Mighty Quinn\"; Jones sang on the first two of these songs.Roberts, David (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums (19th ed.). London: Guinness World Records Ltd. pp. 345â€“346. ISBN 1-904994-10-5. In 1966, Jones left the band to go solo, and was replaced by Mike d'Abo. Soon later, Paul started acting, appearing in the 1967 film \"Privilege\". In 1979, Jones and Manfred Mann member Tom McGuinness formed The Blues Band. They played their last gig in 2022. Since 1991, Jones and McGuinness have toured in The Manfreds, a group that has consisted of former members of the 1960s Manfred Mann band. == References == Category:1942 births Category:British radio personalities Category:English actors Category:English singers Category:Manfred Mann members Category:Living people",
