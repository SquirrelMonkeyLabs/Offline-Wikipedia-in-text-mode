 "text": "Shigeru Yoshida (22 September 1878 â€“ 20 October 1967) was a Japanese diplomat and politician. He served as Prime Minister of Japan from 1946 to 1947 and from 1948 to 1954. He was the Ambassador to England in 1936. By 1939 he had fallen out of favor with the government. He was against the military expansion Japan was engaged in at the time. All he felt he could do was retire. He was later imprisoned for these same views. When General Douglas MacArthur became the military governor of Japan, Yoshida was called to Tokyo to become the new foreign minister. == References == Category:Prime ministers of Japan Category:1878 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Politicians from Kanagawa Prefecture Category:University of Tokyo alumni Category:Japanese diplomats Category:Foreign ministers of Japan Category:Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) politicians",
