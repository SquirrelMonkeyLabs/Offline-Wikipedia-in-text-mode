The dalmatic is worn over the alb and over the stole. == Use == The dalmatic is worn by deacons during special services, like Mass and other sacraments. Bishops may also wear a dalmatic under their chasuble on important days. == History == The dalmatic probably originated in the region of Dalmatia (modern-day Croatia) during the Roman Empire. In the 9th century, the dalmatic was made from thick fabrics, like velvet or silk. It was cut to knee-length with open sides for movement. By the 12th century, the dalmatic began using liturgical colors. Deacons wore it as an outer vestment. In the 20th century, the simple, long white dalmatic became used again. == References == Category:Christian clothing Category:Liturgical clothing",
