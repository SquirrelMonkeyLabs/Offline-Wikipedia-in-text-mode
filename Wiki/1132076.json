 "text": "Delta Piscis Austrini (shortened as Î´ PsA) is a yellow coloured star located in the southern constellation of Piscis Austrinus. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent magnitude of +4.175. There is a star with an apparent magnitude 9.86 located at an angular separation of 5.2 arc seconds, the pair most likely form a binary star system. Using an annual parallax shift of 18.9796 mas as seen from the Gaia satellite, Delta Piscis Austrini is located 172 or 174 light years from the Sun. The main star of the system is an evolved G-type giant star with a spectral type of G8III. The star is about 3.74 billion years. It is a red clump star, which means it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. The star has an estimated mass of about 1.42 times the mass of the Sun and it emits luminosity 52 times that of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,828 K. The star is orbiting the Galaxy at a speed of 13.8 km/s like the Sun. Its estimated Galactic orbit carries it between 24,048 (periapsis) and 35,430 (apoapsis) light years from the center of the Galaxy. == References == Category:Stars",
