 "text": "Reinforced concrete is concrete with long bars inside to make it stronger. The reinforcing material has greater tensile strength than concrete has. Usually the bars are steel. Galvanizing saves the steel from rusting and corrosion. In rich countries, almost all concrete in buildings and roads is reinforced. Reinforced concrete is stronger, and can be even stronger if the steel is stretched to make prestressed concrete. The basic principle behind reinforced concrete is to embed steel reinforcement bars, also known as rebars, within the concrete to provide additional strength and resistance to tensile forces. The concrete acts as a compressive material, while the steel reinforcement handles the tensile forces. == References == Category:Building materials",
