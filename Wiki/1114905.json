 "text": "Vsevolod Mikhailovich Eikhenbaum (18 September 1945), commonly known by his pseudonym Volin, was a Russian anarchist activist. He became involved in revolutionary socialist politics during the 1905 Russian Revolution. He was forced into exile, where his beliefs soon became anarcho-syndicalism. In 1940, while living in poverty in Marseilles, he completed his work on The Unknown Revolution, a history of the Russian Revolution. After the invasion of France by Nazi Germany and the creation of the French State, he was forced to hide because of his Jewish heritage and his anarchist political beliefs. However by the time the liberation of France allowed him to return to Paris, he had got sick with tuberculosis. On 18 September 1945, Volin died in a Parisian hospital. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1882 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Deaths from tuberculosis Category:Ukrainian politicians Category:Ukrainian writers Category:Anarchists",
