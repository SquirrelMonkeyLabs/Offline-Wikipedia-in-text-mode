 "text": "\"Never Gonna Give You Up\" is a dance-pop song originally made by Rick Astley. It was released as a single from Astley's multi-million selling debut album, Whenever You Need Somebody, which was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. The song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the singer's native United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed at number one for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year. The music video for the song has become the basis for \"Rickrolling\", an internet meme where someone is tricked into viewing the music video by clicking on a link to it. == Track listings == ; 7\" single # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" — 3:32 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (instrumental) — 3:30 ; 12\" maxi # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (cake mix) — 5:46 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (instrumental) — 6:19 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" — 3:31 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (escape to New York mix) — 7:01 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (escape from Newton mix) — 6:23 ; 12\" maxi # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (cake mix) — 5:48 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (instrumental) — 3:30 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" — 3:32 ; 12\" single # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (escape from Newton mix) — 6:30 # \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" (escape to New York mix) — 7:00 == Credits == * Written and produced by Stock, Aitken & Waterman * Engineer: Mark McGuire, Mike Duffy * Mixed by: * Escape from Newton mix: Mixmaster Pete Hammond * Escape to New York mix: The Extra Beat Boys == Certifications == Country Certification Date Sales certified CanadaCanada certifications cria.ca (Retrieved September 2, 2008) Gold May 17, 1988 50,000 FranceFrench certifications Chartsinfrance.net (Retrieved September 2, 2008) Silver 1988 200,000 GermanyGerman certifications musikindustrie.de (Retrieved September 1, 2008) Gold 1987 150,000 SwedenSwedish certifications Ifpi.se (Retrieved September 11, 2008) Gold October 21, 1987 10,000 UKUK certifications Bpi.co.uk (Retrieved September 2, 2008) Gold September 1, 1987 400,000 U.S.U.S. certifications riaa.com (Retrieved September 2, 2008) Gold February 24, 1989 500,000 == Charts == Chart (1987-1988) Peak position Australia ARIA Singles Chart 1 Ö3 Austria Top 40 4 Dutch Top 40 1 French SNEP Singles Chart 6 German Singles Chart 2 Irish Singles Chart 2 Italian Singles Chart 3 New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart 1 Norwegian VG-lista Singles Chart 1 Swedish Singles Chart 1 Swiss Singles Chart 2 UK Singles Chart 1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 1 U.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary 1 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play 1 End of year chart (1987) Position Swiss Singles Chart 20 End of year chart (1988) Position Australian Singles Chart 8 == References == == Other websites == * Rick Astley TV, YouTube Category:Rick Astley songs Category:1987 songs Category:Humor",
