 "text": ":For other uses of the word, see Enamel Enamel is made of melted glass, often on metal. Sometimes called vitreous or porcelain enamel, it is made by fusing powdered glass to a base by firing, usually between 750 and 850 °C (1,380 and 1,560 °F). The powder melts, flows, and then hardens to a smooth, durable coating on metal, or on glass or ceramics. It has been used on decorative objects for two, or three thousand years, but especially in the Middle Ages in Europe. In the 19th century, it was used on everyday objects such as kitchen equipment and road signs. The glass is hard-wearing, scratch resistant and easy to clean. == Gallery == File:Silver, silver gilt and painted enamel beaker, Burgundian Netherlands, c. 1425-1450, The Cloisters.JPG|Silver, silver gilt and painted enamel beaker, Burgundian Netherlands, c. 1425–1450, The Cloisters, nyc File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|Limoges? grisaille painted Stations of the Cross, Notre-Dame-des-Champs, Avranches File:Musée Châlons-St Grégoire edit 3.jpg|St. Gregory the Great in painted Limoges enamel on a copper plaque, by Jacques I Laudin File:Louis George Feuer-Emaille-Zifferblatt 01.jpg|Louis George enamel watch dial File:Iranian vitreous enamel.JPG|Iranian enamel ==References== Category:Glass Category:Art materials Category:Chemicals Category:Containers Category:French words and phrases Category:Metalworking Category:Pottery",
