 "text": "Projects in the Jungle is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera. It was released on July 27, 1984 through Metal Magic Records. The song \"All Over Tonight\" was made into a music video. It was the band's first ever music video. The album takes influence from Def Leppard's pre-Hysteria sound and Judas Priest. There are also Van Halen-inspired guitar solos and speed metal like guitar riffs. ==Reception== AllMusic writer Eduardo Rivadavia gave Projects in the Jungle a score of 3.5 stars out of a possible 5. He described Terry Glaze's vocals as \"ear assaulting\" and the lyrics as \"frequently moronic\" examples of glam metal cliches. Even so, the album was seen as \"a major improvement over the band's tentative performance on debut album Metal Magic.\" ==Track listing== All credits are from the original LP. ==Personnel== All credits are from the original LP. ;Pantera *Terrence Lee – vocals *Diamond Darrell – guitars *Rex Rocker – bass, backing vocals *Vinnie Paul – drums ;Production *T.
