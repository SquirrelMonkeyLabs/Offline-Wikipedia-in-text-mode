 "text": "Moray eels are a family of eels in the family Muraenidae. Moray eels can be found all over the world. There are 200 different species in 15 genera. ==Body== Like all eels, moray eels look like a cross between a fish and a snake. The body is generally patterned. In some species, the inside of the mouth is also patterned. Moray eels normally have wide jaws and large sharp teeth, but some types of Moray eel have blunt teeth which help them to eat animals that live in shells. Morays also have pharyngeal jaws inside the main jaws. Typically, moray eels grow to a length of about 1.5 metres. The largest known moray eel is the Slender giant moray, which can reach 4 metres in length. Moray eels live in coral reefs and rocky areas, at a depth of about 200m. ==Habitat== The moray eel can be found in both freshwater habitats and saltwater habitats. However most live in the sea in salt water, never entering fresh water. Moray eels normally live in warmer waters, but it depends on the type of eel. ==Feeding behavior== Morays are opportunistic, carnivorous predators and feed primarily on smaller fish, crabs, and octopuses. There are not many animals that eat eels, but groupers, barracudas and sea snakes do eat them. Humans also eat eels. == Relationship with humans == Humans eat eels, but sometimes moray eels will give people food poisoning. Moray eels are also caught to put in aquariums for people to look at. Some types of Moray eel may be considered beautiful and hard to find, in which case they will be expensive to buy. == Genera == * Subfamily Muraeninae ** Genus Diaphenchelys — 1 species ** Genus Echidna — 11 species ** Genus Enchelycore — 13 species ** Genus Enchelynassa — 1 species ** Genus Gymnomuraena — 1 species ** Genus Gymnothorax — 125 species ** Genus Monopenchelys — 1 species ** Genus Muraena — 10 species ** Genus Pseudechidna — 1 species ** Genus Rhinomuraena — 1 species ** Genus Strophidon — 1 species * Subfamily Uropterygiinae ** Genus Anarchias — 11 species ** Genus Channomuraena — 2 species ** Genus Cirrimaxilla — 1 species ** Genus Scuticaria — 2 species ** Genus Uropterygius — 20 species ==Gallery== File:TakamayuUBf.jpg|Anarchias seychellensis File:FMIB 47184 Gymomuraena vittata, from Cuba.jpeg|Channomuraena vittata File:Echidna nebulosa Réunion.jpg|Echidna nebulosa File:Echida polyzona.jpg|Enchelycore schismatorhynchus File:FMIB 42381 Enchelynassa vinolentus (Jordan & Evermann).jpeg|Enchelynassa canina File:Gymnomuraena zebra by NPS.jpg|Gymnomuraena zebra File:Laced Moray.jpg|Gymnothorax favagineus File:Gymnothorax rueppelliae Réunion.JPG|Gymnothorax rueppelliae File:Monopenchelys acuta - pone.0010676.g012.png|Monopenchelys acuta File:Muraena helena swimming v2.jpg|Muraena helena File:Pseudechidna brummer).JPG|Pseudechidna brummeri File:Ribbon Moray (Rhinomuraena quaesita) (6052858389).jpg|Rhinomuraena quaesita File:Scuticaria tigrina.jpg|Scuticaria tigrina File:Strophidon sathete.jpg|Strophidon sathete File:Uropterygius xanthopterus - 2.JPG|Uropterygius xanthopterus File:Kidako moray.JPG|Gymnothorax kidako == Related pages == * List of fish common names ==References== == Further reading == * Gross, Miriam J..
