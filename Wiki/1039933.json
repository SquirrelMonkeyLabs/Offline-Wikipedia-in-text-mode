It is often called the \"Squirrel Party\" because its logo looks like a squirrel. Its policy is to form a prosperous civil society, with a simple tax system and minimal state intervention in the market. The Reform Party belongs to the Union of European Liberal and Reform Parties, which also includes the Center Party. Kaja Kallas, who has been Prime Minister since 2021, has been leader of the party since 2018. ==References== Category:1994 establishments in Europe Category:1990s establishments in Estonia Category:Political parties in Estonia",
