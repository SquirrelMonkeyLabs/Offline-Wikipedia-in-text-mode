 "text": "The Ares I was a plan to create a crewed rocket for the cancelled Constellation program. Ares I was planned to launch the Orion spacecraft. The Ares I was supposed to complement the Ares V, which was being designed as a cargo launch. The Ares I was planned to be able to carry about 188,000 kilograms (56,000 pounds) to Low Earth orbit. Ares V, Ares IV, and Ares I are named after Ares, the Greek god, which is the equivalent to the Roman god Mars. In 2009 NASA launched a successful prototype of Ares I called Ares I-X to test the rocket. It was the only launch of Ares-I. Category:NASA Category:Rockets Category:Constellation program",
