He went to Heritage Hills High School, where he also played safety, and led his team to the IHSAA Football Finals. He played for the Vanderbilt Commodores football team during his college days, with his final play being a touchdown throw to future Bears teammate Earl Bennett. He formerly played for the Denver Broncos, who drafted him in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Cutler was traded to Chicago for Kyle Orton and a first-round pick in 2009. Cutler was named to the Pro Bowl in 2008. In 2010, after the Bears' loss to the Green Bay Packers in the Conference Championship, people criticized Cutler, calling him a quitter after he hurt his knee. In 2012, Cutler was reunited with Brandon Marshall, who played with him in Denver, as well as Jeremy Bates, who was his quarterbacks coach in Denver. Cutler was also a Bears fan during his youth. ==References== ==Other websites== * Jay Cutler Website * Chicago Bears Bio on Cutler Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Indiana",
