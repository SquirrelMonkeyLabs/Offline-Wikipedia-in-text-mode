 "text": "Mariner 3 was a NASA spacecraft. It was the third spacecraft in the Mariner program. It was designed to take photos of the planet Mars after an eight month journey studying interplanetary (between planet) space. However, the spacecraft lost power eight hours after launch, and it never achieved the correct Mars trajectory. It eventually entered a heliocentric (Sun-centred) orbit. ==References== == Other websites == * * Mariner 03 Category:1960s in spaceflight",
