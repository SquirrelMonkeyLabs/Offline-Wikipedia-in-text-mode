 "text": "The cubic metre (symbol m³) is the SI unit of volume. It is a cube with a length, height, and width of one metre, with 1,000 litres of space. In the many places it is spelled \"cubic meter\". Other names are stère and kilolitre or kiloliter. == Conversions == 1 cubic metre equals: * 1,000 litres * Approximately 35.3 cubic feet * Approximately 1.31 cubic yards * Approximately 6.29 oil barrels A cubic metre of pure water at the temperature of maximum density (3.98 °C) and standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) has a mass of 1000 kg, or one tonne. At 0 °C, the freezing point of water, it is slightly less, 999.972 kg. It is sometimes abbreviated , , , , , when superscript characters or markup are not available/accessible (i.e. in some typewritten documents and postings in Usenet newsgroups). Abbreviated CBM in the freight business and MTQ (or numeric code 49) in international trade. == Multiples and submultiples == === Multiples === ;Cubic decametre :the volume of a cube of side length one decametre (10 m) :equal to a megalitre :1 dam3 = 1,000 m3 = 1 ML ;Cubic hectometre :the volume of a cube of side length one hectometre (100 m) :equal to a gigalitre :1 hm3 = 1,000,000 m3 = 1 GL ;Cubic kilometre :the volume of a cube of side length one kilometre (1,000 m) :equal to a teralitre :1 km3 = 1,000,000,000 m3 = 1 TL === Submultiples === ;Cubic decimetre :the volume of a cube of side length one decimetre (0.1 m) :equal to a litre :1 dm3 = 0.001 m3 = 1 L ;Cubic centimetre :the volume of a cube of side length one centimetre (0.01 m) :equal to a millilitre :1 cm3 = 0.000001 m3 = 10-6 m3 = 1 mL ;Cubic millimetre :the volume of a cube of side length one millimetre (0.001 m) :equal to a microlitre :1 mm3 = 0.000000001 m3 = 10-9 m3 = 1 µL Category:Units of volume Category:SI derived units",
