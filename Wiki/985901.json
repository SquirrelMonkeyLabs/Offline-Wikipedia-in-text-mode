 "text": "\"Gimme Some Slack\" is a song by the American rock band The Cars from the album Panorama. It became a single in 1981. The song was written by a band member Ric Ocasek. ==Release and reception== \"Gimme Some Slack\" was first released on Panorama. But in 1981, the song was released as the third single from said album. However, the song failed to chart in any country. This made it one of the band's least successful singles. The song has since appeared on the Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology compilation album. In his review of Panorama, AllMusic critic Greg Prato stated \"'Gimme Some Slack' proved to be a fierce rocker.\" Prato also said, in his review of Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, that it was \"previously released album tracks [on the album]\" that were \"highlights.\" In the Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology liner notes, Brett Milano said, \"Rockers like \"Getting Through\" and \"Gimme Some Slack\" had a heavier sound than before [Panorama].\" ==B-side== The song's B-side, \"Don't Go to Pieces\", features Benjamin Orr on lead vocals. \"Don't Go to Pieces\" was first released as a B-side to \"Don't Tell Me No\", the single released before \"Gimme Some Slack\". ==References== Category:1981 songs Category:The Cars songs",
