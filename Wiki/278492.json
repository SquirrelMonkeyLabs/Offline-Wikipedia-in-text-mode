 "text": "Manticores (from Greek martikhoras, meaning man-eater) were creatures in Greek mythology. They had the body of a lion, a human head, and three rows of teeth similar to sharks. Although it changes from story to story, they also often had the tail of a dragon or a scorpion. Sometimes they could shoot poisonous spines from their tails. When early Greeks noticed that someone had gone missing, some said this as proof that manticores were real. Category:Legendary creatures",
