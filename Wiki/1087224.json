 "text": "Walla Walla, Walawalałáma (\"People of Walula region along Walla Walla River\"), sometimes called Walúulapam, are Native Americans that live in the area of Pendleton, Oregon. Beginning in the early 1700s, the Walla Walla people raised great herds of horses, making their lifestyle much easier as they gathered seasonal plants. They also traveled across the Rocky Mountains to trade dried roots and salmon to the Plains Indians for buffalo meat and hides.
