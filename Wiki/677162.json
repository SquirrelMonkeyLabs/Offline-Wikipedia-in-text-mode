 "text": "Negroid was a word for a person from Sub-Saharan Africa. The group of these persons was called \"Negroid race\". In times long passed, many people divided human beings into three races. These races were called Negroid, Mongoloid, and Caucasoid. Today, some scientists suggest that there is only one human race. Modern genetic research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong.Templeton, A. (2016). EVOLUTION AND NOTIONS OF HUMAN RACE. In Losos J. & Lenski R. (Eds.), How Evolution Shapes Our Lives: Essays on Biology and Society (pp. 346-361). Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press. . That this view reflects the consenus among American anthropologists is stated in: Features such as a wider nose, curly hair, and dark skin were seen as typical for the Negroid race. ==References== Category:Scientific racism",
