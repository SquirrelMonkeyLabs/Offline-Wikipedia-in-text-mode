 "text": "The StG 44 (Sturmgewehr 44; Assault Rifle 44), known as the world's first assault rifle. Is a gun produced in Nazi Germany during the World War II, replacing the MP-40. Hitler first did not approve of this new class of weapons, so it was called MP-43 and MP-44, meaning Machine Pistol in English. The first service on the Eastern Front was successful, so more were manufactured. == References == Category:Assault rifles Category:8 mm firearms Category:World War II Category:Weapons",
