 "text": "Dateline NBC is an American news magazine. It looks at true crime, though occasionally it looks at other topics. The program began on March 31, 1992 on NBC. The show has been nominated for five Emmy Awards. Dateline NBC has also been the focus of some controversy. On November 17, 1992, the show aired an hour-long report titled Waiting to Explode. That was about certain pickup trucks from General Motors, particularly Chevrolet, blowing up on impact in truck crashes due to poor design. This especially applied to pickups between 1973 and 1987. Past correspondents and anchors are Maria Shriver, Ann Curry and Jane Pauley. ==References== Category:NBC network series Category:1992 television series debuts Category:1990s television series Category:2000s television series Category:2010s television series",
