 "text": "Xerostomia, or dry mouth, also dry mouth syndrome, is dryness in the mouth. It may be associated with a change in the composition of saliva, reduced salivary flow (also hyposalivation), or dehydration. Causes of hyposalivation include dental caries, oral candidiasis, damage to salivary glands, or certain other causes. Certain drugs or medications may also cause dry mouth as a side effect. Minor cases of dry mouth can be treated at home by hydration, re- balancing the minerals in the body, and avoiding acidic foods. More severe cases may need to be looked at by a doctor. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the mouth",
