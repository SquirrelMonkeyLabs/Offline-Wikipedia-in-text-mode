 "text": "Polis means a city, a city-state and also citizenship and body of citizens. In context with Ancient Greece polis means nearly always \"city-state.\" The word originates from the ancient Greek city-states, which developed during the Archaic period and existed well into Roman times, when the equivalent Latin word was civitas, that means 'citizenhood' as well. An ancient polis often centered around a citadel, called the acropolis. Nearly always it had an agora (market) and typically one or more temples and a gymnasium. Many citizens of a polis did not live in the central city but in the suburbs or countryside. The Greeks regarded the polis as a religious and political association: while the polis would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself, the polis would not simply consist of a geographical area. ==Words coming from \"polis\"== Modern European languages have many words that come from polis. In English there are policy, polity, police and politics. In Greek, words coming from polis include politēs and politismos. A number of words end in the word \"-polis\". Most refer to a special kind of city and/or state. Some examples are: * Megalopolis, made by adding Greek word for \"big\" and meaning a conurbation built by merging several cities and their suburbs. * Metropolis, made by adding the Greek word for \"mother\" and meaning the mother city of a colony, the see of a metropolitan archbishop, or a Metropolitan area. Other refer to part of a city or a group of cities, such as: * Acropolis, 'high city' — upper part of a polis, often citadel and/or site of major temple(s). * Tripolis, a group of three cities, retained in the names of a Tripoli in Libya and a namesake in Lebanon ===Other cities=== The names of several other towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East have contained the suffix \"-polis\" since antiquity; or currently feature modernized spellings, such as \"-pol\". Some of the examples are: *Heliopolis, Egypt *Persepolis, Iran *Sevastopol, Crimea, Ukraine The names of other cities were also given the suffix \"-polis\" after antiquity, either referring to ancient names or simply unrelated: *Annapolis, Maryland, United States of America *Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America *Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America *Illiopolis, Illinois, United States of America *Metropolis, Illinois, United States of America *Demopolis, Alabama, United States of America *Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil *Thermopolis, Wyoming, Unites States of America There are a large number of cities ending in polis located in Brazil, particularly in the state of Goiás.
