 "text": "Hornussen is sport played in Switzerland. Its name comes from the puck which is called a \"Hornuss\" (hornet) or \"Nouss\". When hit, the hornuss can whizz through the air at up to 300 km/h (186.4 mph) and creates a buzzing sound. It is a team sport, played between two teams of 16-20 players. Teams take turns to see how far they can hit the hornuss, while the other team attempts to stop it in the air with a type of bat, called a \"schindel\". Together with Schwingen and Steinstossen, Hornussen is seen as a Swiss national sport. There are only a few teams in other countries. == References == Category:Sport in Switzerland",
