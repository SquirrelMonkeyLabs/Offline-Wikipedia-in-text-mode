 "text": "The M134 Minigun is an American 7.62x51mm six-barreled machine gun. Its rate of fire is 3000 to 4000 rounds (bullets) per minute. It is called \"mini\" as compared to the earlier, much bigger M61 Vulcan. In movies and video games, the Minigun is sometimes called the chaingun, but this is a mistake. The chaingun is completely different and has only one barrel. ==References== ==Other websites== * 1985 Patent of a Minigun Category:Machine guns",
