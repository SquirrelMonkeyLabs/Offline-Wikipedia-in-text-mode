 "text": "Rey Skywalker is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, played by Daisy Ridley. She is the main protagonist of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. She first appeared as one of the lead characters in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Rey is a scavenger who was left behind (for protection) on the planet Jakku when she was a child, and soon becomes involved with the Resistance's conflict with the First Order after meeting Finn, a former Stormtrooper, and BB-8, the droid of ace Resistance pilot Poe Dameron. Although her background was unknown in the first two movies and her last name was not said as a decision by J. J. Abrams, it was revealed in The Rise of Skywalker that she is the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine. This disproved fan theories, saying that she is the daughter of Han Solo, Princess Leia or Luke Skywalker or even Obi-Wan Kenobi's granddaughter. ==References== ==Other websites== * Rey in the official StarWars.com encyclopedia Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2015 Category:Star Wars characters",
