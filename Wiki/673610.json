 "text": "On December 24, 2018, a helicopter carrying Martha Érika Alonso Hidalgo, the newly elected Governor of the Mexican state of Puebla, and her husband, Senator and former Governor Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas, crashed on a hill in Coronango near the city of Puebla. Five people on board the helicopter were killed in the crash: Alonso, Moreno, the two pilots, Captain Roberto Coppe Obregón and Captain Marco Antonio Pavera Romero, and Héctor Baltazar Mendoza, an assistant to the senator. Alonso was 10 days into her term as governor. Its destination was the Helipuerto Radio Capital in Mexico City. It crashed on 24 December at 14:50 local time (20:50 GMT), just ten minutes after takeoff from a heliport in Puebla. The crash site is in the Santa María Coronango. Mexico had sought the aid of the United States National Transportation Safety Board, but the NTSB could not support the investigation due to the government shutdown underway. ==References== Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2018 Category:2018 in Mexico Category:December 2018 events Category:Disasters in Mexico 2018 helicopter crash Category:Transport disasters in North America",
