 "text": "An environmental factor (also called eco factor) is any factor which influences living organisms. Abiotic factors include ambient temperatures, the amounts of sunlight and PH of water soil in which organisms live. Biotic factors include the availability of food organisms and the presence of predators, parasites and competitors. Cancers are often related to environmental factors. Having a healthy diet, healthy weight, limiting alcoholic drinks and quitting or not starting smoking cuts down the risks of getting cancer. Environmental triggers for asthma and autism have been studied also. ==References== Category:Health Category:Environment",
