The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Gers department are: Arrondissements of the Gers department INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 321 Auch Auch 87,118 2,133.9 154 322 Condom Condom 65,562 2436.8 158 323 Mirande Mirande 37,945 1686.1 150 ==History== Since its creation, the Gers department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the Gers department with six districts: Auch, Lectoure, Condom, Nogaro, L'Isle- Jourdain, Mirande; the capital was Auch * 1800 : creation of the arrondissements: Auch, Condom, Lectoure, Lombez, Mirande * 1926 : the arrondissements of Lectoure and Lombez are eliminated ==References== Gers",
