 "text": "Gavriil (Gavrila) Romanovich Derzhavin (; 14 July 1743 - 20 July 1816) was one of the most important Russian poets before Alexander Pushkin. He was also a statesman. His works are usually thought to be literary classicism. However, his best verses have many antitheses and conflicting sounds. This writing is similar to John Donne's works and other metaphysical poets. ==Works== Derzhavin is remembered most for his odes. He did not pay attention to genres, which were common in odes at the time. He would use humor, satire, and elegy in his odes. For example, in his grand ode to the Empress, he says that he searches for fleas in his wife's hair. He also compares his own poetry with lemonade. Unlike other Classicist poets, Derzhavin chose his details carefully. For example, he wrote the colour of the wallpaper. He thought that the French language was about harmony, while Russian was about conflict. He sometimes used alliterations. However, he sometimes purposefully used the cacophonous effect in his writings. == References == ==Other websites== * *Collection of Poems by Gavrila Derzhavin (English Translations) *Illustrated timeline *Acrostic - How Mighty Time Strives Like A River (English Translation) *Luba Golburt, \"Derzhavin's monuments: Sculpture, Poetry, and the Materiality of History\", Toronto Slavic Quarterly 13, Summer 2005, retrieved 23 October 2006.
