 "text": "On International Purple Hijab Day (or Global Hijab Day or Purple Hijab Day), women wear purple hijabs to remember Aasiya Zubair, who was killed by her husband on February 12, 2009. The event also honors other people who have experienced in-home violence. Muslim women who honor this day wear a purple hijab (a head covering or veil). Non-Muslims might wear the same thing, or they might use a purple headscarf, tie, hat, or Kufi. Each year, the day occurs around February 12 - the day Zubair was killed. In 2024, it was observed on 10th of February. ==Background== Aasiya Zubair was an American Muslim who helped start Bridges TV, the first American Muslim TV channel. Her husband murdered her on February 12, 2009, a week after Zubair had asked for a divorce. After Zubair's murder, people found that her husband had been physically and emotionally harming her for many years. Each year, near February 12, people do Purple Hijab Day to remember her. The first Purple Hijab Day was on February 13, 2010. They chose the color purple for sadness and sadness from death. Aasiya Hadayai Majeed, who works at the Baitul Salaam Network (a group that works with women who have faced domestic violence), said that \"[Zubair's] murder made Muslim communities start to talk about domestic violence more\" and to discuss how to prevent it. ==Debates about Islam== Some people believe Islam allows men to harm women (though others disagree). However, others disagree. The Baitul Salaam Network, which works with women who have been harmed by people in their homes, said: > One of the most ugly stereotypes is that Islam gives men the right to beat > their wives. According to the Voice of Libyan Women (VLW), Islam teaches that Muslims should not harm others, and that there is a severe punishment in the afterlife for individuals who abuse other people, the land, the sea, or plant life. The VLW wrote: > It has been argued many times that violence against women is allowed in > Islam, however, this is a huge falsehood due to the misinterpretation and > misuse of religion. Islam does not teach, accept, or allow abuse of any > living thing. ==Related pages== * Islam and Clothing * Islamic feminism * Women and Islam ==References== Category:February observances Category:Domestic violence Category:Feminism Category:Hijab",
