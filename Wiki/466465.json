This made Darika immensely powerful and arrogant. Armed with this boon, Darika went on to conquer the world, defeating even Indra, the king of the gods. As his atrocities became intolerable, the sage Narada asked Shiva to stop Darika. Shiva agreed, saying that Darika would be killed by the goddess Kali. Shiva opened his third eye and produced Kali, whose purpose was to destroy Darika. The goddess was a woman and not born among the humans. She killed him by beheading him. The goddess didn't stop with Darika and, unable to control her rage, began destroying the landscape and the very humans for whose sake she had destroyed Darika. The Gods could not defeat her, and she was finally calmed when Shiva lay on the ground in front of her, submitting. == Festival == Pathiyanadu Sree Bhadrakali Temple Festival is held every year, One of the Festival is Navaratri Mahotsavam and it is about Nine Days Festival and the Main Festival (Kumbabharani Mahotsavam) usually between February and March.
