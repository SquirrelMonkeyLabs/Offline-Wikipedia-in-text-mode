Clay with the mission to provide foster children with financial and independent living skills and access to personal records. == History == Living Advantage's founder, Bernice W. Clay, envisioned a nonprofit to assist underprivileged youth. As a speech pathologist for the Los Angeles Unified School District, she developed a passion for helping high-risk adolescents. On September 30, 1993, LA, Inc. was incorporated as a nonprofit by the state of California. In 1996, Bernice opened her first six-bed group home. Bernice passed away three years later, but her daughter, Pamela R. Clay, the executive director of LA, Inc., has continued LA, Inc.'s mission to help at-risk youth. During her 24-year tenure, Pamela discovered that many youths lack essential life documents necessary for securing jobs, driver's licenses, bank accounts, or enrolling in school. In response, she developed the patent-pending electronic data storage program called Electronic Lockbox or eLockbox. == Living Advantage Youth Center (LAYC) == On May 30, 2024, LA, Inc. opened its first youth center with a grand opening ceremony. The Living Advantage Youth Center (LAYC) grand opening ceremony was attended by Crenshaw community leaders, supporters, and the general public. The ceremony commenced with a poignant ribbon-cutting led by a heartfelt video message from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, setting the tone for the dayâ€™s festivities. Joining in the celebration were President JC Lacey of the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce and Todd Johnson, President of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce. Attendees were invited to explore the expansive facility, a testament to the vision of providing a holistic support system for youth. Classrooms, counseling rooms, recreational areas, and resource centers promised a safe haven for growth and development. == Notable Recognition == === Chad L. Coleman === Chad L.
