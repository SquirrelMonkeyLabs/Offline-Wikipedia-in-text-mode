 "text": "The 19th South Korean presidential election was held on 9 May 2017. The election was called after the impeachment and dismissal of President Park Geun-hye. The election was held in a single round on a first-past-the-post basis. The election was originally scheduled to be held on 20 December 2017, but was moved earlier after the decision of the Constitutional Court on 10 March 2017 to uphold the parliament's impeachment of Park Geun-hye. Opinion polling before April showed the Democratic Party's candidate, Moon Jae-in, runner-up in the 2012 election, as the front-runner and would later go on to win the election. == Candidates == Moon Jae-in May 2017 (original).jpg|Moon Jae-in (Democratic Party) from South Gyeongsang File:Shinzō Abe and Hong Jun-pyo at the Japanese Prime Minister's Office (cropped 2).jpg|Hong Jun-pyo (Liberty Party) from South Gyeongsang File:Ahn Cheol-Soo cropped (cropped).jpg|Ahn Cheol-soo (People's Party) from South Gyeongsang File:Yoo Seong-min in Gangneung (Cropped).jpg|Yoo Seong- min (Bareun Party) from North Gyeongsang File:Sim Sang-jung taking a commemorative photo with the Speaker of the National Assembly.jpg|Sim Sang-jung (Justice Party) from Gyeonggi === Polling === File:2017 Korea Presidential Election Opinion Polling.png|Opinion polling of candidates from April-May 2017 until the election == Results == Regions · Provinces · Cities Moon Jae-in Democratic Hong Jun-pyo Liberty Korea Ahn Cheol-soo People's Yoo Seung-min Bareun Sim Sang-jung Justice Votes % Votes % Votes % Votes % Votes % Seoul National Capital Area Seoul 2,781,345 42.3 1,365,285 20.78 1,492,767 22.7 476,973 7.26 425,459 6.47 Incheon 747,090 41.2 379,191 20.9 428,888 23.7 118,691 6.54 129,925 7.16 Gyeonggi 3,319,812 42.1 1,637,345 20.8 1,807,308 22.9 540,023 6.84 546,373 6.92 Gwandong (Gangwon) 324,768 34.2 284,909 30.0 206,840 21.8 65,278 6.86 62,389 6.56 Hoseo (Chungcheong) Daejeon 404,545 42.9 191,376 20.3 218,769 23.2 59,820 6.34 63,669 6.75 North Chungcheong 374,806 38.6 255,502 26.3 211,454 21.8 57,282 5.90 65,095 6.70 South Chungcheong 476,661 38.6 306,614 24.8 290,216 23.5 68,521 5.55 83,868 6.79 Sejong 77,767 51.1 23,211 15.2 32,010 21.0 9,192 6.03 9,353 6.14 Honam (Jeolla) Gwangju 583,847 61.1 14,882 1.55 287,222 30.1 20,862 2.18 43,719 4.60 North Jeolla 778,747 64.8 40,231 3.34 285,467 23.8 60,802 2.56 29,296 4.93 South Jeolla 737,921 59.9 30,221 2.45 378,179 30.7 25,819 2.09 49,509 4.01 Yeongnam (Gyeongsang) Busan 872,127 38.7 720,484 32.0 378,907 16.8 162,480 7.21 94,329 4.85 Ulsan 282,794 38.1 203,602 27.5 128,520 17.3 60,289 8.13 62,187 8.38 Daegu 342,620 21.8 714,205 45.4 235,757 15.0 198,459 12.60 74,440 4.72 North Gyeongsang 369,726 21.7 827,237 48.6 253,905 14.9 149,017 8.75 88,080 5.17 South Gyeongsang 779,731 36.7 790,491 37.2 284,272 13.4 142,479 6.71 113,051 5.32 Jeju 169,493 45.5 68,063 18.3 77,861 20.9 22,784 6.11 31,716 8.51 Total 13,423,800 41.08% 7,852,849 24.03% 6,998,342 21.41% 2,208,771 6.76% 2,017,458 6.17% == Notes == == References == Category:May 2017 events Category:2017 in South Korea Category:2017 elections in Asia Category:Presidential elections",
