 "text": "The Belgae were a group of tribes living in northern Gaul. They were on the west bank of the Rhine, in the 3rd century BC. Later they were also in Britain, and possibly even Ireland. They gave their name to the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, and very much later, to the modern country of Belgium. The Belgae came to Britain as raiders and settled in southern Britain shortly before the Romans came.John Rhys, Celtic Britain (London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; New York: E.S. Gorham, 1908), p. 4 They occupied the area later called Hampshire.David Hughes, The British Chronicles, Volume 1 (Westminster, MD: Heritage Books, 2007), p. 25 == References == Category:Ancient history Category:Ethnic groups in Europe",
