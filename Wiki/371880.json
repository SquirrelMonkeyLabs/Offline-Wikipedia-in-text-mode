 "text": "Semites was a word used for people who speak a Semitic language like Arabic or Hebrew. Scientists don't use the words Semites or Semitic peoples any longer, but they still speak of Semitic languages.On the use of the terms “(anti-)Semitic” and “(anti-) Zionist” in modern Middle Eastern discourse, Orientalia Suecana LXI Suppl. (2012) by Lutz Eberhard Edzard : \"In linguistics context, the term \"Semitic\" is generally speaking non-controversial... As an ethnic term, \"Semitic\" should best be avoided these days, in spite of ongoing genetic research (which also is supported by the Israeli scholarly community itself) that tries to scientifically underpin such a concept.\" ==Origin== The word Semite was taken from Shem, a son of Noah in the Genesis (chapters 6-11). It was first used in the 1770s by German professors at Göttingen university. ==Related pages== * Hamitic * Antisemitism ==References== Category:Middle East Category:Pseudoscience Category:18th century in Europe",
