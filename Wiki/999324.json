It was approved for use in America in 2017. It was approved in Europe in 2022 and in the National Health Service in 2023. Sales of Wegovy increased five-fold in 2023. Ozempic became the world's biggest- selling diabetes drug. People who had the weekly injection saw their weight drop by 12% on average after 68 weeks. It is also prescribed for heart conditions. In a trial of more than 17,600 people aged above 45 with obesity who had cardiovascular disease, but not diabetes, published in 2023, it cut the risk of heart attacks by 28%. A black market developed in the United Kingdom in 2023 with unlicensed semaglutide being sold through social media and in beauty salons. ==References== Category:Anti-diabetic drugs Category:Obesity",
