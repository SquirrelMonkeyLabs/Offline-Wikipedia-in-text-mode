As of mid 1994, the Pacific Northwest Bell company was no longer used for business. Three years earlier it was replaced by US West Communications. It does business as CenturyLink Communications (also called as LUMEN). There are talks, though, saying the company may be brought back sometime in the future. ==References== Category:1961 establishments in the United States Category:1994 disestablishments in the United States Category:Defunct companies Category:American telephone companies",
