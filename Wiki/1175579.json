 "text": "The Three Arts Club of New York was a New York City home and club for women in the \"three arts\" of music, art and drama. The club was founded in 1902 by Jane Harris Hall. The building was designated as a New York City Landmark on May 23, 2024. ==History== The first Three Arts Club, established in 1902 by Jane Harris Hall, was a residential club for women students pursuing music, drama, and the fine arts. Once located at 325 West 56th Street, the club provided a supportive environment for aspiring artists.} In 1927, architect George B. de Gersdorff designed a new eight-story building at 340 West 85th Street, featuring a large auditorium, a library, dining hall, and rooms for 153 students. The new building replaced the club's previous six-story home on the same site. Among its notable residents was actress Ruth Gordon. Since 1953, the building has been owned by the Volunteers of America. The Three Arts Club inspired similar organizations across the county, including the Three Arts Club of Chicago. ==References== *",
