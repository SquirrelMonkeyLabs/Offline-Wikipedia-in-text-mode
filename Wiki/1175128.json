 "text": "The Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory is one of the two main definitions of acids and bases in modern chemistry, alongside the Lewis acid-base theory. A chemical is a Brønsted–Lowry acid if it can give a hydrogen ion to another chemical, and a chemical is a Brønsted–Lowry base if it can take a hydrogen ion from another chemical. When an acid loses a hydrogen, it becomes its conjugate base, and when a base gains a hydrogen ion, it becomes its conjugate acid. According to these definitions, an acid-base reaction always takes the form : where AH is a Brønsted-Lowry acid, B is a Brønsted-Lowry base, is the acid's conjugate base, and is the base's conjugate acid. == Comparison to Arrhenius theory == The Brønsted-Lowry theory (adds to or) expands the Arrhenius theory to understand amphoteric compounds, compounds like ammonia that act like a base without containing hydroxide, and solvents other than water. In the Arrhenius theory, sodium hydroxide is a base, and hydrochloric acid is an acid, which has the Arrhenius neutralization reaction : that produces a salt (sodium chloride) and water. In the Brønsted-Lowry theory, sodium hydroxide is no longer considered a base, but rather an equivalent of the actual base, the hydroxide ion . When sodium hydroxide dissolves, it splits into and . The sodium is considered a spectator ion that does not participate in the actual reaction. The acid-base reaction is : Here, the chloride ion is the conjugate base of , while water is the conjugate acid of . The dissolved ions making sodium chloride is not part of the acid-base reaction. ==References== Category:Chemistry",
