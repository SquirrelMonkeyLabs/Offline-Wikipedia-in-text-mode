The mountain is named for its first conqueror, the English alpinist, explorer, writer and engraver Edward Whymper. In 1901, Whymper and his four guides (Joseph Bossoney, Christian Kaufmann, Christian Klucker, and James Pollinger) first climbed Mount Whymper. It was renamed to honour him. Before the mountain was named Mount Lefroy. Whymper was exploring the area sponsored by Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to promote the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the railway in his conferences. There is another Mount Whymper in British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. It is named for Edward's brother Frederick Whymper. ==References== Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Mountains of British Columbia",
