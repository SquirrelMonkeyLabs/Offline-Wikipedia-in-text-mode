 "text": "Stanley's warty frog (Callulina stanleyi) is a frog. It lives in Tanzania. It lives in the South Pare mountains. People have seen it between 1920 and 2100 meters above sea level. The adult frog is about 42.5 mm long from nose to rear end. It is brown in color with a pattern. There are white warts on both sides of the body. This frog climbs trees. At night, it sits on branches or on dead wood. ==Reproduction== The frog lays eggs during the dry season. The mother frog sits on the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They are never tadpoles. The frogs become adults in about eight months. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where the frogs live. Humans cut trees down to get wood to build with, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to build towns and cities. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for William T. Stanley of the Chicago Field Museum. Stanley has studied living things in the Pare Mountains. ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
