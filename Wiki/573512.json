 "text": "Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera (; born 4 April 1957), commonly known as \"El Chapo\", is a Mexican former drug lord and a former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzmán was considered to be the most powerful drug trafficker in the world until he was extradited to the United States and sentenced to life in prison. Guzmán began working with Héctor Luis Palma Salazar by the late 1970s, one of the nation's rising drug lords. He helped Salazar map routes to move drugs through Sinaloa and into the United States. He later supervised logistics for Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, one of the nation's leading kingpins in the mid 1980s, but Guzmán founded his own cartel in 1988 after Félix's arrest. Guzmán was first captured in 1993 in Guatemala and then was extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking. He bribed multiple prison guards and escaped from a federal maximum-security prison in 2001. He was arrested again in Mexico in 2014. He escaped a second time in 2015, through a tunnel dug by associates into his jail cell. Mexican authorities recaptured him following a shoot-out in January 2016, and extradited him to the U.S. a year later. In 2019, he was found guilty of a number of criminal charges related to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel, was sentenced to life imprisonment, and incarcerated in ADX Florence, Colorado, United States.\"El Chapo sentenced to life in prison.\" BBC News 17 July 2019. == References == Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sinaloa Category:People from Mexico (state) Category:Criminals Category:Mexican drug lords",
