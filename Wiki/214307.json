Even if the person is told that they are doing it, they usually can't stop. Sometimes if they try really hard, they can make the tic go away for a little bit, but they can't make it go away all the time. in most case's tics are not harmful but it can become so if physical movement becomes involved Tics can be either \"motor tics\" or \"phonic tics.\" If they are \"motor tics\" it means they're movements, like blinking or shrugging shoulders. If they are \"phonic tics\" it means they're sounds, like clearing your throat, sniffing, or yelling. Tics are common in childhood, four to twelve percent of all children have tics. Very often this is transitory, tics rarely last longer than six months. Boys have tics more often than girls. About three times more boys than girls have tics. Sometimes, people can have a \"tic\" in the family, meaning that more than one member has a tic, or that a parent used to have a tic. Some tics can be treated, usually with behaviour therapy. In cases where the tic is difficult to treat, antipsychotics are sometimes used. *Tics are part of the obsessive-compulsive complex of behavioural disorders, == References == Category:Medical signs Category:Human behavior",
