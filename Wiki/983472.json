 "text": "LaFace Records was an American record label. It was owned and operated by Sony Music Entertainment. LaFace was formed in 1989 as a joint venture between the producer duo Antonio \"'L.A.\" Reid and Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and Arista Records. The combined nicknames of the duo's successful production company inspired the name of the label. LaFace became a successful label throughout the 1990s, responsible for producing popular artists such as TLC, Toni Braxton, OutKast, Pink, Usher, Goodie Mob, Ciara, Donell Jones, Pressha and Cee-Lo Green. Towards the end of the decade, LaFace produced fewer artists and Babyface began to focus more on his own music career. In 2011, LaFace became defunct.
