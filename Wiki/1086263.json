 "text": "Victoria Penelope Jane Ward (born 3 July 1969) is an American writer and journalist. She is known for her work as a Senior Reporter for CNN. Before CNN, Ward was a writer and editor for many different magazines and newspapers including The Independent, New York Post, Vanity Fair, HuffPost, and many others. Some topics she wrote about were Jeffrey Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell. Ward would say that her article on Epstein included interviews with Annie and Maria Farmer. Annie and Maria both had raised complaints about Epstein and his behavior early on. Ward would say that the interview would be erased from the article by Graydon Carter, the main editor for Vanity Fair. This came after Epstein had pressured the magazine to get rid of it. Ward would also say that she had hired bodyguards because she was threatened by Epstein while she was pregnant. Ward was born in Chelmsford, England and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2017. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Journalists from New York City Category:Writers from New York City Category:English journalists Category:English writers Category:CNN people Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Writers from Essex",
