 "text": "In the Books of Kings, after King Solomon died, his kingdom known as Israel split into two kingdoms one in the North and one in the South. The one in the South was called Judah and the one in the North was called the Kingdom of Israel. It was later conquered and destroyed by the Assyrian emperor Shalmaneser who exiled its people who were known ever since then as the Lost Tribes of Israel. Israel's capital was Samaria. It was richer than Judah but it fell earlier than it. The story of the Northern Kingdom comes from Jeroboam's Revolt. Jeroboam led the 10 tribes to revolt against Rehoboam in a civil war. ==References== Category:Jewish history Category:History of Israel Category:Former monarchies of Asia Category:Former countries in the Middle East",
