 "text": "The list of Khuman monarchs outlines the lineage of rulers from the Khuman dynasty, one of the prominent ruling groups in ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur). The Khuman dynasty played a significant role in the early history of the region, particularly before the emergence of a unified Meitei kingdom, through Meitei confederacy. This list traces the succession of Khuman kings, highlighting their contributions to the cultural and political landscape of early Manipur. == List == According to the royal chronicle Khuman Kangleirol, there were 32 kings in the independent Khuman dynasty. If 9 earlier kings from the shared Khuman-Luwang ancestral line are included, the total becomes 41. If King Thawaren, the brother of King Poireiton, is also added, the total becomes 42. === Common ancestry with the Luwang dynasty === The Khuman-Luwang common royal lineage comprises nine principal rulers: Nongdamlen Akhuba, Nongdamlen Ahanba, Kurumlen Meinaidaba, Kurumlen Meinaiba, Pothang Ponghan, Heironglen Longjumba, Heirong-ngang Thanganglen, Poireiton, and Singdangpung Tabung Singminnaba. The total increases to ten if Thawaren, the brother of Poireiton, is included. Singtangpung Tapung Singminnapa, the ninth and final ruler of the undivided Khuman-Luwang common ancestral royal line, had two sons. His elder son, King Aalong, established the independent Khuman dynasty, while his younger son, King Pamingnapa, founded the separate Luwang dynasty. === Independent Khuman dynasty === Ancient Meitei name(s) Latin transliteration Alternative spelling(s) (if any) Latin transliteration Modernized Meitei name(s) Latin transliteration Alternative spelling(s) (if any) Latin transliteration Note(s) Aalong Aarong First ruler of the independent Khuman dynasty;
