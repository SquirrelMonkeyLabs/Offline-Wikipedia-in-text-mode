 "text": "The Epte is a river in Seine-Maritime and Eure, in Normandy, France. It is a tributary of the river Seine. It begins in Seine-Maritime department in the Pays de Bray, near Forges-les-Eaux. The river empties into the Seine not far from Giverny.Robert I C Fisher; Linda Dannenberg; et al, Fodor's 2012 France (New York: Fodor's Travel Pub, 2012), p. 292 In 911, the Treaty of Saint- Clair-sur-Epte established the river as the historical boundary between Normandy and Île-de-France. This divided the traditional county of the Vexin into two parts. The Norman Vexin became a part of Normandy while the French Vexin remained a part of the Île-de-France. A series of castles were built on both banks of the Epte to guard this frontier.Peter Fraser Purton, A history of the early medieval siege, c.450-1200 (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2009), p. 254 Claude Monet lived at Giverny near the river for more than forty years.Claire Joyes; Claude Monet, Claude Monet : life at Giverny (New York: Vendome Press, 1985), passim In his garden, by diverting a branch of the Epte, he established a water garden with its famous water-lily pond and a Japanese- style bridge. The river appears in several of his works, including Peupliers au bord de l'Epte (Poplars on the Banks of the Epte). ==References== ==Other websites== *http://www.geoportail.fr *The Epte at the Sandre database Category:Rivers of Normandy",
