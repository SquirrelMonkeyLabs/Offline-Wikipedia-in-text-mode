 "text": "Tiger parenting is a form of strict authoritarian parenting, whereby parents are highly invested in ensuring their children's success. Specifically, tiger parents push their children to attain high levels of academic achievement or success in high-status extracurricular activities such as music or sports. The term \"tiger mother\" (\"tiger mom\") was coined by Yale Law School professor Amy Chua in her 2011 memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. Tiger parenting is common in many Asian countries, such as Malaysia. It can be refered to as violent parenting, where a child is being subject to harsh physical punishment, which is considered to be called child abuse outside Asia. In extreme cases, harming of parents may occur like Sef Gonzales and Jennifer Pan, but in some cases, when dealing with autistic children, tiger parenting may be bolstered by the likes of Kiwi Farms and Something Awful. == References == Category:Child abuse Category:Family",
