 "text": "Abigail Williams ( 1680 or 1681disappeared 3 June 1692) was a girl who, along with her supposed relative Betty Paris, was one of the first people to falsely accuse her neighbors of performing witchcraft. The accusations eventually led to the foundation of the Salem witch trials. == Biography == === Birth and early life === Abigail Williams was born 1680 or 1681. Her precise birth date and place is rather disputed. The names and identities of both of her biological parents are also rather disputed. It has been suggested she may have been a orphan, as she was adopted and lived with Samuel Parris and his daughter Betty Parris. Samuel and his daughter Betty might be Abigail's relatives, and it has been suggested that they might have been her uncle and cousin. She lived with Samuel and his daughter Betty in Salem Town, Massachusetts Bay Colony (in modern-day Salem, Massachusetts). Some modern-day scholars suggest she may have been Samuel's household servant. === Exhibiting signs of odd behavior and Abigail's appearances and in court === It is said that beginning in December 1691 or January 1692, Abigail Williams and her supposed relative Betty Paris began exhibiting signs of odd behavior. They ran around rooms with their hands high up, they tried to climb the roof of their house through the chimney, they screamed seemingly uncontrollably, and began talking in strange voices. This is said to have continued for the next month or so. Eventually, Samuel Parris brought a physician to his house. The physician had Abigail and Betty examined and at first he believed they were psychologically ill. When he failed to diagnose them with a psychological disorder, which contained symptoms what Abigail and Betty had exhibited, he then believed they were bewitched and that witchcraft was performed on them. The town tried to the find the people who bewitched Abigail and Betty. They arrested the other people who lived in Samuel Parris' home: Sarah Good, Sarah Osbone, and Samuel Parris' slave Tituba. It was around this time that Abigail and Betty began going to court and lying to the judge that their neighbors were performing witchcraft. Abigail had testified seven times in court, regarding the witchcraft. Abigail continued to appear in court and accuse more people of performing witchcraft. The majority of Abigail's appearances in court took place between March and May 1692. She continued to appear in court and make accusations until 3 June 1692. === Disappearance from historical record === Abigail Williams made her final appearance in court and spoke to the judge for the final time on the 3rd of June, 1692. The final appearance in court is the final historical record regarding Abigail Williams. After the last record regarding Abigail's final court appearance, Abigail absolutely disappeared from historical record after 3 .
