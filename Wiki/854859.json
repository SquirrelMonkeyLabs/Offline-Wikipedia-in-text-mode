 "text": "I Made a Game with Zombies in It! (officially stylized as I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MB1ES 1N IT!!!1), is a multi-directional shooter video game for the Xbox 360 available through the Xbox Live Indie Games service. It was developed by Ska Studios and was designed entirely by company founder James Silva. The game's stylized title is clearly in leet-speak. About a decade later, the game was re-released on Steam in November 2021 and through Xbox Store in October 2022. ==Gameplay== The player shoots waves of attacking zombies while collecting power-ups. The goal is survive until the background song ends. The song in question is rock-style background song sung by Silva (the developer of the game) with lyrics about the game itself. The background song (which is literally named after the game) was made available to download on the official Ska Studios website. The song was also released through the Rock Band Network, about a year after the game's release. Silva said Xbox Live's indie game price point inspired him to make \"a $1 experience that delivers.\" He did not expect it to be a success, and that he was \"half-expecting it to fail for being too stupid of a game.\" ==Reception== The game surpassed 160,000 copies sold by January 2010 on its original store, it was unexcepted success for the ceatore. The game was noted for its quirky sense of humour and theme song. IGN ranked it the best independent game of 2009. IGN writer Erik Brudvig said the game was extremely entertaining and \"somehow about as insane as its title,\" despite the simple controls. I Made a Game with Zombies in It! won the 2009 Inside Gaming Award for Best Indie Game. ==References== ==Other websites== *Xbox Live Marketplace website Category:2009 video games Category:Indie video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Shoot 'em ups",
