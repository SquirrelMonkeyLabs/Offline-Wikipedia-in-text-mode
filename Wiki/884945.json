 "text": "\"There once was a man from Nantucket\" is the first line in many limericks. This is usually because the word \"Nantucket\" is easy to rhyme with. The limerick where the line is from was first written for the Princeton Tiger in 1902. Many other newspapers made limericks about the man and the bucket. Sexual versions of the limerick have made it popular. One of these versions comes from 1927 in the book Immortalia. == References == Category:American poems Category:Humor",
