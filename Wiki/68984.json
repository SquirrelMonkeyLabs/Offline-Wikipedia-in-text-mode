 "text": "Speaker is the title of the person in charge of some legislatures, usually the lower house. ==House of Commons of the United Kingdom== The speaker is elected by other members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, and is usually a member of the government party, but leaves his or her party because the speaker must be neutral (not like one side more than another). The speaker does not vote. If the speaker wants to stand in for re-election the other parties do not oppose him to show he is neutral. As of January 2020, the speaker is Lindsay Hoyle, a member of the Labour Party. == Dail Éireann in Ireland == The speaker (Ceann Comhairle) of the Dáil Éireann is neutral, but the constitution (Bunreacht) of Ireland says he does not need to stand for re- election, he is given the first seat in his constituency. The current speaker (November 2017) is Sean Treacy. == United States House of Representatives == The speaker is the leader of the largest party. He or she is not neutral, but votes for his or hers party's policies. The speaker also helps to get his or her party's ideas made law. The term of the speaker of the House is two years in office.
