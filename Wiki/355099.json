Between 1955 and 1963, the British ran a series of seven nuclear-weapon tests at Maralinga, then inside the range. The Joint Project ran until 1980, when the British withdrew from the program.

It is named after the Dharuk word for a spear-thrower. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Military of Australia Category:Geography of South Australia",
