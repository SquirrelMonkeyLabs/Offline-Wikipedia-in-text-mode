 "text": "The Historia Salonitana (\"History of the Bishops of Salona and Split\"), written by Thomas the Archdeacon in the mid-13th century, is a critical medieval historical source on the early history of Croatia, the church, and the Dalmatian region. Written in Latin, the text focuses on the history of the Salonitan Church and its transformation following the fall of Salona and the rise of Split as a regional center. == Content and themes == # Salona's decline: The book recounts the destruction of the Roman city of Salona in the 7th century during the Avar and Slavic invasions. Refugees fled to the fortified Diocletian’s Palace in Split, establishing a new Christian and cultural hub. # Rise of Split: As the center shifted from Salona to Split, the city became the seat of the archbishopric, inheriting the spiritual and political prominence of the region. This transition is a central theme in the Historia Salonitana. # Relations with Croatian rulers: The work also explores the interactions between the church in Split and early Croatian rulers, such as Trpimir I and Tomislav, reflecting the integration of the Croatian state into Christian Europe. # Legend and historical narrative: The text combines historical events with legends, such as the account of King Zvonimir’s violent death, which later became part of Croatian folklore. == Extended versions == The Historia Salonitana Maior, a later expanded version created in the 16th century, includes additional details about Croatian kings and church councils. This version incorporates documents like the Pacta Conventa, which outlines agreements between Croatian nobility and Hungarian rulers. == Legacy == The Historia Salonitana remains a foundational text for understanding medieval Dalmatian and Croatian history. It is preserved in several manuscript versions, with critical editions published for modern research. The text provides valuable insights into the region’s transition from Roman to medieval governance and the role of the church in shaping Croatian identity.
