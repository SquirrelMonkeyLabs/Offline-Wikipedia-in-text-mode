 "text": "Pluralism is a concept used in many fields and mostly means that things are done in many parts or ways. That is unlike monism, which has a single way or thing in a system, or dualism, which has two. In political science, pluralism supports more than either one political party or two major dominant parties and considers even very minor parties as important. In philosophy it contrasts with monism and has multiple ideas that possibly form a structure, rather than a reduced number of entities. == Related pages == *Democracy *Multiculturalism Category:Social sciences Category:Politics",
