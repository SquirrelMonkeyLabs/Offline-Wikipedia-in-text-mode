 "text": "The March of Friuli was a Carolingian march. The March was in the historical region of Friuli. This area is now in the modern province of Friuli-Venezia Giulia in north-eastern Italy. In 776, the Franks conquested the Lombard Kingdom. This meant that Frankist dukes would rule the Duchy of Friuli. They slowly expanded to the east of this area to where the Slavs and Avars were. In 828, the area controlled by the Franks was reorganized. The central area (Friuli) would be ruled by local counts. These local counts were later margraves. In 843, the region was added to the Middle Francia. The area was ruled by margraves (sometimes also called dukes) from the house of Unruochings. The region was part of post-Carolingian Italy until 952. In 952, the area was given to the Duchy of Bavaria as the March of Verona. The March of Verona had parts of modern Italy and Slovenia. ==Governors== ===Dukes=== * 776-787 Marcarius * 789-799 Eric * 799-808 Hunfrid * 808-817 Aio * 817-819 Cadalaus * 819-828 Balderic ===Margraves=== * 830-866 Eberhard (also dux Foroiuli) * 866-874 Unroch (III) * 874-890 Berengar, also Holy Roman Emperor * 891-896 Walfred * 896-924 Berengar, also Holy Roman Emperor * 924-952 Berengar II ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * Category:770s establishments Category:9th century in Europe Category:10th century in Europe Category:History of Slovenia Category:10th-century disestablishments",
