 "text": "Tribune Tower East is a proposed mixed use tower on the eastern edge of the Tribune Tower property in the Streeterville area of the Near North Side community areas of Chicago. If completed, the skyscraper would become the second-tallest in Chicago. Plans were officially announced for a tall 200-unit hotel, 439-apartment and 125-condominium building on April 16, 2018. These plans make the building shorter than the Willis Tower, the city's tallest. On mid-October 2018, the Chicago Plan Commission approved the plans for the city's second tallest building. Chicago City Council approved the plans in an October 31 meeting. ==References== Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States",
