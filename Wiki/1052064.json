During his time in AEW, Allin has been a two-time AEW TNT Champion and one-time AEW Tag Team Champion. ==Career== ===All Elite Wrestling=== On April 12, 2019, Allin signed a contract with All Elite Wrestling (AEW). Allin made his AEW in-ring debut at Fyter Fest on May 25, 2019 fighting Cody to a draw. On November 7, 2020 at Full Gear, Allin defeated Cody Rhodes to win the AEW TNT Championship, winning his first championship in AEW. After his win, Allin teamed with Rhodes. They feuded with Team Taz. Powerhouse Hobbs turned heel by attacking Rhodes and Allin on the November 18, 2020 episode of Dynamite. Allin and Rhodes would defeat Hobbs and Ricky Starks at Winter Is Coming. After the match, Team Taz went to attack them but they were saved by a debuting Sting. Sting would then take Allin as a protege. He would manage him and sometimes tag with him. Allin would lose the TNT Championship to Miro on the May 12, 2023 episode of Dynamite. On September 5, 2021 at All Out, Allin was defeated by CM Punk. This was Punk's first professional wrestling match in AEW and his first match in 7 years. Allin would win the TNT Championship for second time when he defeated Samoa Joe on the January 4, 2023 episode of Dynamite. He later lost it back to Joe on February 1 edition of Dynamite. On the February 7, 2024 episode of Dynamite, Allin and Sting would defeat Ricky Starks and Big Bill to win the AEW World Tag Team Championships. This was Sting's first championship in AEW. At Revolution, Allin and Sting would successfully defend their championships against The Young Bucks (Matthew and Nicolas Jackson). This was also Sting's retirement match and with his retirement, the championships would be vacated. ==Personal life== When he was five-years-old, Rasch got into a car accident. He was riding in the passenger seat on a car when his uncle was drunk driving. His uncle ended up crashing and dying. Ratsch paints half of his face in a skull when he wrestles because he says that he has been \"half dead\" ever since. This event is also why he is straight edge. Ratsch is also a fan of skateboarding. He skates down the ramp to the ring during his entrance and sometimes uses it as a weapon. Ratsch was married to professional wrestler Priscilla Kelly until they divorced on August 10, 2020. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:All Elite Wrestling people Category:American professional wrestlers Category:American skateboarders Category:Sportspeople from Seattle",
