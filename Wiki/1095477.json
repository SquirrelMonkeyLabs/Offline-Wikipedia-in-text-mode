 "text": "Marble Madness is a platform racing video game. It was both published and developed by Atari Games. It was released in December 1984 in arcades, not too long after the video game crash of 1983. Outside of arcades, Marble Madness would also be released for many consoles including the Master System, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Sega Genesis home consoles. It would also be released for the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Game Gear handheld consoles. As well as the Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Java ME, IBM PC, X68000, and ZX Spectrum home computers. In the game, the player controls a marble and has to move it through a maze. The player has to get the marble through the end of the racecourse maze before the timer runs out. The mazes are inspired by artwork by M. C. Escher. A sequel titled Marble Man: Marble Madness II was planned and at least 12 prototype boards were produced but the game was never released. ==Reception== When the game was released in arcades, it was very well liked by game critics. Critics said they liked the hard difficulty of the game, graphics, visuals, designs, and soundtrack. It has often been placed on Top Games lists. The game was also very popular and was the highest-earning game in arcades for the first six weeks of its release. ==References== Category:1984 video games Category:Atari video games Category:Midway video games Category:Amiga games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Apple II games Category:Arcade games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Game Boy games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Game Gear games Category:Marble video games Category:Master System games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Platform games Category:Racing video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Single-player video games Category:Trackball video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:ZX Spectrum games",
