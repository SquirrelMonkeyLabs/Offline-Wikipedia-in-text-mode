This caused a tremendous increase in radio traffic across the Atlantic Ocean. The General Electric corporation made the acquisition of Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America in 1919. With this they formed the Radio Corporation of America (RCA).Eric P. Wenaas, Radiola: The Golden Age of RCA, 1919-1929 (Chandler, AZ: Sonoran, 2007), p. viii In 1926, RCA created the first nationwide broadcast network, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). After the golden age of radio had passed, RCA began to decline. In 1982 they ended most of their public affairs programs. Finally, in 1986, General Electric bought back RCA, along with NBC, for $6.28 million. In 1988, General Electric sold the right to use its brand on consumer electronics, as well as various assets of RCA, excluding NBC, to Thomson. == References == Category:1919 establishments in the United States Category:1986 disestablishments in the United States Category:Companies based in New York City",
