 "text": "Associative property is a property of mathematical operations (like addition and multiplication). It means that if you have more than one of the same associative operator (like +) in a row, the order of operations does not matter. For example, if you have 2+5+10\\ , there are two plus signs (+) in a row. This means we can add it in either this order: : (2+5)+10=(7)+10=17\\ Or this order: : 2+(5+10)=2+(15)=17\\ The answer comes out the same both ways because addition is associative. In other words, associativity means: : (2+5)+10=2+(5+10)\\ Not all operations are associative. Subtraction is not associative, which means: : (10-5)-2 e10-(5-2) This is true because: : (10-5)-2=(5)-2=3\\ : 10-(5-2)=10-(3)=7\\ And: : 7 e3 Also, associativity is different from commutativity, which lets you move the numbers around.
