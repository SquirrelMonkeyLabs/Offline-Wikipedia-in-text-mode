 "text": "The Glaspaleis (English: Glass Palace) is a building in Heerlen (Dutch Limburg), built in the years 1934-1935 and serves as the cultural centre. Most part of the building is covered with glass. It belongs to the architecture of Het Nieuwe Bouwen, a style more or less comparable to that of the Bauhaus, Modernism and International Style. Architect is Frits Peutz, largely responsible for reshaping Heerlen in a modern way. The Glaspaleis is one of the top thousand buildings of the twentieth century. == References == * Rijckheyt Category:Heerlen Category:Buildings and structures in the Netherlands",
