S. 23 South of the park is the separate Werakata State Conservation Area. == History == Werakata National Park was opened on 26. February 1999 from a 1130 acres of Cessnock State Forest (State Forest No. 874) formed. On the 1st January 2003 came another 478 acres from the state forest, as well as the Aberdare State Forest (State Forest No. 981) with 531 hectares. The Werakata State Conservation Area with 2257 hectare area was created in 2007. The Hunter River area was inhabited by the Aboriginal countries of Awabakal, Worimi, Wonnarua, Geawegal, Birripai and Darkinjung, but little is known about their use of the land near what is now the national park after European settlement in the 19th century. In the 19th century, forestry was practiced and sawmills were built in and near today's park. Most of the wood was used to expand the mines in the area. In 1942, the Cessnock State Forest was established as a sanctuary, followed by the Aberdare State Forest in 1963. The logging continued until it was rededicated in the national park.
