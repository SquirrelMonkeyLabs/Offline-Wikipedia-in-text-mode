The strike took place while Hezbollah leaders were meeting at a headquarters located underground residential buildings in Haret Hreik in the Dahieh suburb to the south of Beirut. The attacks were done by the Israeli Air Force using F-15I fighters. The operation involved dropping more than 80 bombs, including US-made bombs. These destroyed the underground headquarters as well as nearby buildings. On 28 September 2024, the IDF announced his death; his body was found from the rubble two days after the strike. His death was confirmed by Hezbollah on the same day. The attack resulted in at least 33 fatalities and more than 195 injuries, including civilians. ==References== Category:September 2024 events Category:Hezbollah Category:2024 in Lebanon Category:History of Beirut",
