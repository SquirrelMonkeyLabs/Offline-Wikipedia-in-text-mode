 "text": "Phasmahyla spectabilis is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 850 meters above sea level. This frog lives in rainforests. The adult frog lives in bromeliad plants. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over water, and the tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch. Scientists do not believe this frog is in danger of dying out because the place where it lives is not in danger. Human beings grow trees that the frogs can live in to make shade for cacao cabrucas farms. Scientists think this frog can make useful chemicals in its skin. But they do not think anyone catches this frog to take the chemicals. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
