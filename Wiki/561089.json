It is a suburban area with many houses that is about 34 miles (55 kilometers) from Chicago. == History == The area where Lincolnshire is used to be have many Potawatomi Native Americans lived. European people began living there starting in 1834. These people named the place Half Day. Farmers began buying land in what is now Lincolnshire after World War I. A businessman named Roger Ladd bought a lot of land in the area in 1955 to build houses. The area became a village in 1957. For about the next 20 years, Lincolnshire was a quiet place. However, as the other towns in the area were making lots of money from shops and offices, Lincolnshire started to allow businesses in the village in the 1980’s and 1990’s. It became a town with many houses, stores, and offices, as it is today. == References == Category:Villages in Illinois",
