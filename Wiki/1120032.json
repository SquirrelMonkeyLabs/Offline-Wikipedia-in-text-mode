 "text": "A gravity gun is a weapon or tool in video games that uses the game's physics engine to pick up and throw objects. The first and best recognized version of a gravity gun appeared in Half-Life 2. Many games released after that have similar items. In Half-Life games, the gun is used to pick up and launch items at enemies. It is also used to push large and unbreakable objects out of the way. Other types, for example the Garry's Mod Physics Gun, allow the player to pick up, move, and throw moveable items. Category:Fictional weapons",
