 "text": "Unbinilium is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the periodic table. It is also known as eka- radium. Its atomic number should be 120 and is has the symbol Ubn. The name Unbinilium and the symbol Ubn are temporary IUPAC names (meaning \"one-two-zero-ium\" in Latin). This name and symbol exists until a permanent name is decided and the element is discovered. It is expected to be a s-block element and an alkaline earth metal. It is the second element in the eighth period of the periodic table. This element has not been synthesized (obtained or discovered) yet. A German team at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research attempted a research on 2011. It suggested a possible production of 299Ubn. But it couldn't be done. Attempts were planned by the Russian, Japanese, and French teams. Attempts were made in 2017-2020 and the experiments from the attempts showed that 8th period elements were difficult to synthesize. Unbinilium is expected to be the last element that can be synthesized through current technology. == Uses == As of 2025, it is still a theoretical element and has no uses. ==References== Category:Hypothetical chemical elements",
