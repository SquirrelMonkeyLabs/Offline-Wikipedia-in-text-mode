It was inside a tartan suitcase. The body had been in the water for a long time, and had started to decompose. The local police set up a crime scene which was investigated by NSW Police Forensic Services Group. The forensic evidence and investigation led to the boy's mother, Rachel Pfitzner, who lived in nearby Rosemeadow. Police later arrested her. She was charged with Dean's murder and sentenced to 25 and a half years in jail. ==References== Category:2005 births Category:2007 deaths Category:2007 crimes Category:Murdered children",
