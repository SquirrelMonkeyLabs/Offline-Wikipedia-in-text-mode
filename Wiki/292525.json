 "text": "Sir John Richard Hicks (8 April 1904 – 20 May 1989) was a British economist. He contributed to the fields of consumer demand theory in microeconomics. In 1937, he developed the IS/LM model which summarizes a Keynesian view of macroeconomics. His book Value and Capital (1939) significantly extended general-equilibrium and value theory. The compensated demand function is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1964. In 1972 he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (jointly) for his pioneering contribution to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory. Hicks died on 20 May 1989 at his home in the Cotswold village of Blockley at the age of 85.john hicks – British Academy Retrieved 15 January 2018. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1989 deaths Category:British economists",
