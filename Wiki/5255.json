Athena is often shown wearing her helmet and holding her shield. The shield later had Medusa's head on it, given to Athena by Perseus after he killed Medusa. Athena is also the protector of Athens, Greece, a city named after her. The Parthenon, on the Acropolis in Athens, is her most famous temple. She is also seen with Nike, the goddess of victory. == Folklore == ===Birth=== In Hesiod's Theogony, Zeus married Metis. The Oracle of Delphi said Metis would give birth to Athena and a son who would overthrow Zeus, just as Zeus overthrew Kronos, and Kronos overthrew his father Uranus. To prevent this, Zeus swallowed Metis while she was pregnant. Inside Zeus's head, Metis made a helmet, armor, and a robe for Athena, causing Zeus severe headaches. Hephaestus split Zeus's head open, and Athena emerged fully grown and armored. ===Lady of Athens=== As a war goddess, Athena fought alongside Greek heroes. Athena is considered the protector of the safety of kings, meaning she safeguards the wellbeing and security of kings. She offers wisdom and strategic counsel to keep them safe. Athens was a powerful sea force, winning against the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis. In another legend, Poseidon gave the Athenians their first horse, while Athena gave them the first olive tree. Athena was declared the patron goddess of Athens. The olive tree brought wood, oil, and food, becoming a symbol of Athenian growth. ===Patron of heroes=== Athena helped heroes like Jason and the Argonauts, and Perseus in his quest to kill Medusa. She gave Perseus tools to kill Medusa, such as her polished bronze shield.

In military training or initiation ceremonies, she represents wisdom, courage, and strategic thinking. \"Athena Parthenos\" (meaning \"Athena the Virgin\") emphasizes her independence and purity. These titles highlight the qualities expected of young men and women entering adulthood. Athena was frequently confused with Aphaea, a local goddess of Aegina, Artemis, and the nymph Britomartis. In Arcadia, she was worshiped as Athena Alea. Temples to Athena Alea were located in Mantineia and Tegea. The temple of Athena Alea in Tegea was an important center of ancient Greece.

This emphasizes her independence and wisdom from birth. * Metis: In Hesiod's \"Theogony,\" Zeus swallowed Metis, who was pregnant with Athena, to prevent a prophecy that his child would overthrow him. Later, Athena was born from Zeus' head, fully grown and wearing armor. Athena's association with Athens comes from a myth where she competed with Poseidon to be the city's patron deity. She won by offering the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity. ==Modern representations== One of Sigmund Freud's most valued items was a small, bronze statue of Athena on his desk.
