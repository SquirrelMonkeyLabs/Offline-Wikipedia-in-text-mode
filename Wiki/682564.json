 "text": "In computer science, a holographic algorithm is an algorithm – a set of steps – that uses a holographic reduction. A holographic reduction always takes the same amount of time, and makes a big problem easier to solve. Holographic algorithms are not like laser holography, except metaphorically. People have used holographic algorithms to find polynomial-time (\"efficient\") ways to solve problems related to mathematical graphs, like satisfiability. Holographic algorithms may be connected to the P versus NP problem or computational complexity theory. Holographic algorithms are like quantum computation in some ways, but they work with completely normal computers. == References == Category:Algorithms Category:Computer science",
