 "text": "Sustainable energy is energy that is created in an environmentally friendly way. It involves both energy efficiency and renewable energy. Both resources help to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Efficient energy use allows energy demand to slow so that rising clean energy supplies can make big cuts in fossil fuel burning. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Unless clean energy supplies grow rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions. Reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. Any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables. ==Types== * Geothermal energy * Hydroelectricity * Hydropower * Nuclear powerAccording to IAEA * Solar power * Tidal power * Wave power * Wind power ==References== ==Related pages== *Sustainable biofuels *Sustainable development Category:Energy Category:Sustainable development",
