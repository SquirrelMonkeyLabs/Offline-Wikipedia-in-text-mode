 "text": "Yuxisaurus is an extinct genus of basal armoured (thyreophoran) dinosaurs. Its remains were found in the Lower Jurassic of southwestern China. The type species is Yuxisaurus kopchicki.eLife. 11: . The find was in Yuxi, Yunnan Province, China. The holotype of the taxon, CVEB 21701, is a partial skeleton including parts of the skull and at least 120 osteoderms. It is a typical Ankylosaur in its general appearance and probable lifestyle. The discovery of Yuxisaurus shows that thyreophorans were present in what is now Asia during the early Jurassic. Their later spread is not surprising, considering that all the continents were so close together. == References == Category:Ankylosauria",
