He is the identical twin brother of Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback Ronde Barber. ==College career== Barber played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers. ==NFL Playing Career== ===New York Giants=== In 1997, Barber was drafted by the New York Giants. By all field accounts, Barber's NFL career was a success. He got the Giants to a Super Bowl XXXV appearance and became the team's all-time leading rusher. Barber, however, surprised many when he decided to retire after the 2006 season. In 2007, the Giants won Super Bowl XLII without Barber. ===Attempted Comeback=== In the 2011 offseason, Barber announced that he would seek an NFL comeback. The statement was not received well by nearly anyone, since Barber was 35 years old, well beyond the normal age that famous runningbacks retire. Barber talked about going to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and joining his twin brother Ronde Barber, but a Tampa Bay front office executive promptly said \"no way.\" Barber was brought in by the Miami Dolphins for a tryout, but was not signed. ==Controversy== Barber has drawn critics on and off the field. He has been criticized for remarks he made about Giants teammates Michael Strahan and Eli Manning. Barber also divorced is wife while she was pregnant to marry a woman he had a relationship with while married. ==Children's Author== Tiki and twin brother Ronde Barber have written several children's books about their childhood and how they grew up.
