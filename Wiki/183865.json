 "text": "Wouter Jacob Bos (born July 14, 1963) was a Dutch minister of finance, deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Dutch Labour Party. He won the election of Dutch Labour Party leader, defeating Jouke de Vries. He led the party until March 12, 2010, the day he left. His successor is Job Cohen, who used to be the mayor of Amsterdam. He left because he wanted to spend more time with his family. He left as minister of finance and deputy Prime Minister because the government felt over the decision of Uruzgan. The Dutch Labour Party was in the coalition, together with Christen Democraten App√®l and the ChristenUnie, both Christian parties. The Dutch Labour Party did not agree and stepped out of the coalition. == References == * Bio at Parlement.com Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Deputy government ministers of the Netherlands Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of the Netherlands Category:Leaders of political parties in the Netherlands Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands Category:Government ministers of the Netherlands Category:Labour Party (Netherlands) politicians Category:People from Vlaardingen Category:Politicians from South Holland",
