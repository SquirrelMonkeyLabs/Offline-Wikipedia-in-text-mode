 "text": "Anxious-preoccupied attachment is a form of attachment with a strong wish for intimacy, a fear of being ignored, and the constant need for reassurance. Those with anxious-preoccupied attachment tend to be sensitive to emotional cues and external pain. * Ainsworth, M. D. S. (1992). A consideration of social referencing in the context of attachment theory and research. In S. Feinman (Ed.), Social referencing and the social construction of reality (pp. 349â€“367). New York: Plenum. * * * * ==Causes== Psychologists believe that such attachment is caused by the increased activation of a person's amygdala during social appraisal tasks, making him or her more likely to project his or her \"actual self\" onto others. ==Research== Research found that younger adults had higher levels of anxious-preoccupied attachment than older adults. ==References== Category:Life Category:Health Category:Psychiatry Category:Personality Category:Psychology Category:Psychoanalysis",
