 "text": "The Rugby World Cup is the most important tournament in the sport of rugby union. The first one was in 1987. The cup happens every four years. The competition is one of the biggest sporting events in the world (along with the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics). There are only 20 spots available in a Rugby World Cup, so teams must compete for them in a qualifying competition. Teams that reached the knockout stages of the previous tournament automatically qualify for the next tournament. The 2019 competition was held in Japan, with South Africa winning. The current 2024 champions are South Africa. == Results by nation == Team Champions Runners-up Third place Fourth place Top 2 Top 4 South Africa 4 (1995, 2007, 2019, 2024) — 2(1999, 2015) — 2 4 New Zealand 3 (1987, 2011, 2015) 1 (1995) 2 (1991, 2003) 1 (1999) 4 7 Australia 2 (1991, 1999) 2 (2003, 2015) 1 (2011) 1 (1987) 4 6 England 1 (2003) 2(1991, 2007) — 1(1995) 3 4 France — 3(1987, 1999, 2011) 1(1995) 2(2003, 2007) 3 6 Argentina — — 1(2007) 1(2015) 0 2 Wales — — 1(1987) — 0 1 Scotland — — — 1(1991) 0 1 == Other websites == * – official site *World Rugby Category:Rugby union",
