The movie was very successful, making $553.7 million worldwide at the box office against its $140 million movie budget and becoming the highest-grossing movie of 1998 and the highest-grossing movie to be released by Touchstone Pictures. The movie received mixed reviews from movie critics. Armageddon was released in the same summer as the similarly themed Deep Impact, which was also very successful but earned less than Armageddon at the box office, while astronomers described Deep Impact as being more accurate. == Related pages == * Deep Impact (movie) - another impact event-based movie released in 1998 * Impact event * Impact crater == Other websites == * * * * Category:1998 movies Category:1990s disaster movies Category:1990s science fiction movies Category:Science fiction action movies Category:American disaster movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:Movies about impact events Category:1990s English-language movies Category:Movies about astronauts Category:Movies about nuclear war and weapons Category:Movies set in Florida Category:Movies set in Houston Category:Movies set in Istanbul Category:Movies set in New York City Category:Movies set in Paris Category:Movies set in Washington, D.C.
