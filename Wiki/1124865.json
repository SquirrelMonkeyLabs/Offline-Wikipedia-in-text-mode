 "text": "Certified Lover Boy is the sixth studio album by Canadian rapper Drake. Certified Lover Boy was released on September 3, 2021. In April 2019, Drake announced that he was working on a new album. On a December 10 DaBaby concert in Toronto, Drake showed up as a guest. He announced to the crowd that he was putting the finishing touches on the album. Before the release of Dark Lane Demo Tapes, he would announced the new album and set a release date for late in 2020. However, Drake would pushback the release of the album twice after he injured his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The official release date of September 3 would be revealed during an episode of SportsCenter. Drake would dedicate the album to the memories of his friends Nadia Ntuli and Miss Mercedes Morr. The album's cover art was made by artist Damien Hirst and features twelve pregnant emojis which would garner some controversy. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, selling 613,000 album-equivalent units. It was the largest debut-week units for the year. With the release, Drake gained a total of ten number-one albums, becoming the eighth artist in Billboard 200 history to do so. The album would break the biggest opening-day streams record for both Apple Music and Spotify. Certified Lover Boy would be certified 3Ã— Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album would be nominated for Best Rap Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards but Drake would withdraw from contention. It would win Top Rap Album at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards. The album features the singles \"Way 2 Sexy\" which was released on September 3, 2021, \"Girls Want Girls\" on September 28, 2021, and \"Knife Talk\" on November 16, 2021. ==Songs== ==References== Category:2021 albums Category:Drake (musician) albums Category:OVO Sound albums",
