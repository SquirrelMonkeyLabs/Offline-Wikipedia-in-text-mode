It is build as a direct clone of the Apple Mac Mini, which was launched 7 years before in January 2005. It is built to be a very small PC that can be used for basic computer jobs like word processing and internet reading. It can also be used to play most computer games. Some people use the NUC as a home theater computer because of its small size and how quiet it is. ==History== The Intel NUC is on its sixth generation. The generations were called, in order from oldest to newest, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Bay Trail, Haswell, Broadwell/Braswell, and Skylake. The names come from the processor that is on the motherboard of the NUC. ===Models=== Sandy Bridge Kit Board DCCP847DYE DCP847SKE Ivy Bridge Kit Board DC3217IYE D33217GK DC3217BY D33217CK DC53427HYE D53427RKE Bay Trail Kit Board DN2820FYKH DN2820FYB DE3815TYKHE DE3815TYBE Haswell Broadwell / Braswell Skylake ==References== Category:Computers",
