The words were written by Hugh Sherlock and the music was composed by Robert Lightbourne and arranged by Mapletoft Poulle. ==Lyrics== Eternal Father, bless our land, Guide us with Thy mighty hand, Keep us free from evil powers, Be our light through countless hours. To our leaders, Great Defender, Grant true wisdom from above. Justice, truth be ours forever, Jamaica, land we love. Jamaica, Jamaica, Jamaica, land we love. Teach us true respect for all, Stir response to duty's call, Strengthen us the weak to cherish, Give us vision lest we perish. Knowledge send us, Heavenly Father, Grant true wisdom from above. Justice, truth be ours forever, Jamaica, land we love. Jamaica, Jamaica, Jamaica, land we love. ==Other websites== * Jamaican Government site on the Anthem (with lyrics) and Pledges * Sound file (mp3) * Category:1962 songs Category:North American anthems Category:National symbols of Jamaica",
