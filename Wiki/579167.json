 "text": "A WHO working definition for sexual health is that it \"is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.\" However, while used by WHO as well as other organizations, this is not an official WHO position, and should not be used or quoted as a WHO definition. ==References== ==Related pages== *Reproductive rights Category:Human sexuality Category:Health",
