 "text": "\"For the Gambia Our Homeland\" is the national anthem of the Gambia. The words were written by Virginia Julia Howe and the music composed by Jeremy F. Howe. It is based on the traditional Mandinka song \"Foday Kaba Dumbuya.\" It was adopted after an international competition to produce a state anthem (and flag) before the country declared independence in 1965. ==Lyrics== English original Wolof translation For the Gambia, our homeland We strive and work and pray, That all may live in unity, Freedom and peace each day. Let justice guide our actions Towards the common good, And join our diverse peoples To prove man's brotherhood. We pledge our firm allegiance, Our promise we renew; Keep us, great God of nations, To the Gambia ever true. Gambia mede sunyu rewe. Nyu nge jaim di liggaye de nyan Ndakh nyun nyep nyu bolloh nek a bena Am sunyu affier ak jama base bu neka. Na degga sama sunyu jefye Nyeal jef yu bakh ye ngu digalleh Tay bolleh sunyu girr ye Ndakh wonneh ni dom adama wara nekeh bena. Nyunge tailleh Sunyu degga deggi nangu Tei essal sunyu diggeh Yalla mu maggame omba askanwe Sahal nyu chi Gambia beh fau. ==References== Category:1965 works Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of the Gambia",
