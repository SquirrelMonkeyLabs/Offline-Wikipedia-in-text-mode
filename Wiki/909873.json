 "text": "Sidrapong Hydroelectric Power Station (a.k.a. Sidrapong Hydel Power Station), located from Darjeeling town, is the oldest hydroelectric power plant in India. Opened on 10 November 1897, its original capacity was 2 Ã— 65 kW, which was expanded to a total 1000 kW in 1916. Having reached the limit of the water supply, the equipment was replaced in 1931 for triple-phase transmission. The station uses water from the streams Kotwali, Hospital and Barbatia, moved through a network of flumes to reservoirs, then passed down penstocks to the generators. West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) took over operation of the station and Darjeeling Electric Supply in 1978. In the 1980s, the station was damaged due to a landslide and remained closed for a decade, but was re- opened in 1997. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in West Bengal Category:Dams in Asia Category:Economy of India",
