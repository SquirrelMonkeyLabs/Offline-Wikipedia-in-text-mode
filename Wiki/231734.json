 "text": "\"Swing Life Away\" is a song by hardcore punk band Rise Against. It is from their 2004 album Siren Song of the Counter Culture. It was first written by Tim McIlrath and Neil Hennessy, the song is different from most of Rise Against's other songs because it is performed and recorded acoustically. The lyrics are happy and speak of happiness with a less-than-perfect life, although they maintain the band's characteristic themes of self-analysis and hope. At a show at Festival Hall in Melbourne, Australia, McIlrath stated the song was written about a good friend of the band who helped them whilst they were lesser known.
