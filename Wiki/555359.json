The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of the Hautes-Alpes are: Arrondissements of the Hautes-Alpes INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 051 Briançon Briançon 35,752 2,138.1 37 052 Gap Gap 104,131 3,410.5 130 ==History== Since its creation, the Hautes-Alpes department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the department with four districts: Briançon, Embrun, Gap and Serres; the capital was Chorges but in the same year it was moved to Gap. * 1800 : creation of three arrondissements: Gap, Briançon and Embrun. * 1926 : the arrondissement of Embrun was eliminated. ==Related pages== *Arrondissement of Briançon *Arrondissement of Gap *List of arrondissements of France ==References== Hautes-Alpes",
