 "text": "Crown green bowls is a type of bowls. It is played outdoors on grass or artificial turf. It is named crown green because of the raised center of the grass. Crown green bowls is played in the Midlands, Northern England, and North Wales. ==History== The game of bowls started in 3200 BC in Ancient Egypt. It was a type of boules. Crown Green was developed from the 15th to 18th century. Rich players wanted to play bowls in gardens. Poorer players played the game in parks. The less flat surfaces led to Crown Green rules. The British Crown Green Amateur Association was created in 1907. This association created standard rules for the game. Lancashire is the oldest bowling county association in England. ==Playing the game== ===Equipment=== The game has very little equipment apart from the playing surface. It has a small ball called a \"jack\". The jack is the target to throw at. The jack can be white or yellow. The players roll larger balls (known as \"bowls\" or \"woods\") at the jack. The bowls were historically black or brown. Recently, these can be in any colour. The bowls are heavier on one side. The heavier side is known as the bias. When rolled forward, the bowl will turn left or right towards the bias. At the end of the area where the game is being played is a small channel called the \"ditch\". There is also a rectangular carpet called a \"mat\". The person playing has to stand on the mat. Unlike other types of bowls, the playing surface isn't flat. ===Rules=== The player has to stand on the mat. Teams of up to four players compete. The players are named by what position they are in order. The first player is the \"lead\". The next two are \"second\" and \"third\". The last player being called a \"skip\". The skip usually starts at the other end of the area until their turn to play. The bowls are heavier on one side. The heavier side is known as the bias. When rolled forward, the bowl will turn left or right towards the bias. == References == Category:Bowls Category:Sport in the United Kingdom Category:British culture",
