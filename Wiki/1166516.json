 "text": "Hasbaya District is one of the four districts of the Nabatiyeh Governorate of Lebanon, located in the southeast. Under Ottoman suzerainty, the town was historically the seat of the Chehab family, who ruled the area. The Chehabi Citadel, a notable feature in the town, was constructed by them. == Population == It has a population of 37,784 as of 2017 consensus. == Nearby Borders == It has borders with Israel to the south and Syria to the east. == History == Hasbaya was one of several towns that the Druze assaulted during the civil war in Mount Lebanon in 1860. After a protracted siege, the Christian residents were largely routed and massacred. Scholars also claim that the Druze killed seventeen Muslim Shihab emirs because they defended the Christians. Sa'id Janbulat's sister, Sitt Nayfa, was commended by the French consul for her efforts to defend Christian emirs' wives. However, the Druze did not attack American missionaries, who were not connected to the Maronites, nor did they plunder the Protestant church in Hasbayya. Because of the American mission in Beirut, several of the local Orthodox Christians converted to Protestantism in 1844. == References == Category:Lebanon templates Category:Lebanon geography Category:Lebanon",
