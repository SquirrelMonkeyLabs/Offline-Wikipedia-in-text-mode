The pavilion was called Pavilion 70 and later Moscow Pavilion. == History == Before the World Exhibition was held in Canada in 1967 the Soviet architects hoped that the World Exhibition would be held in Moscow. In the early 1960s they offered to adapt the exhibit to the Soviet Union's to document the history of the country for the \"50th anniversary of the October Revolution\" in 1967 with an emphasis on \"progress and peace.\" Moscow's chief architect Mikhail Pusuchin proposed to create a spherical pavilion the size of: \"Moscow State University Main Building\" on an artificial lake. However, Nikita Khrushchev's forced resignation and financial problems due to heavy costs led to the Soviet Union's refusal to organize the exhibition. The Bureau of International Exhibitions finally decided to entrust the task to the City of Montreal in Canada on the anniversary of the founding of Montreal. In 1970 the building began to move to Moscow and construction took five years. In 1977, the Pavilion was inaugurated on the site of the Moscow Exhibition Center. == Gallery == File:Expo 67, sculpture Faucille et marteau, aux abords du pavillon de l'URSS.jpg| File:Pavillon URSS (6).jpg| File:Pavillon URSS (3).jpg| File:Pavillon URSS (2).jpg| == Other websites == * Moscow Pavilion in the All-Russia Exhibition Centre website * Moscow Pavilion in the \"westland\" website * Moscow Pavilion in the \"architectuul\" website Category:Convention and exhibition centers in Moscow",
