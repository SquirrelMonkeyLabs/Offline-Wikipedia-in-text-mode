 "text": "The Chicago Bears are a professional American football team in the National Football League based in Chicago, Illinois. The Bears were founded in Decatur, Illinois, by George Halas, in 1919. They were first called the Decatur Staleys, after the A.E. Staley Starch Company which owned the team for its first two seasons. The team has won nine NFL Championships, with the last being in 1985 (Super Bowl XX). They also played in Super Bowl XLI in 2006 against the Indianapolis Colts, but they lost 29-17 to Peyton Manning and the Colts. The team is owned by Virginia Halas McCaskey, and the general manager is Ryan Pace. The team's current head coach is Matt Nagy since 2018. The Bears play their home games at Soldier Field. They played there from 1974 to 2001 and then 2003-present (Soldier Field was being made new in 2002). The Bears had played at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970. Wrigley Field is the home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, and the Bears were named after the Cubs.
