 "text": "Electrostar is the name given to a group of similar electric multiple unit passenger trains made by Bombardier Transportation, formerly ADtranz. Since the privatisation of British Rail, it has become the most common new EMU type in Britain, with different variants referred to as Class 357, Class 375, Class 376, Class 377, Class 378, Class 379, Class 387. They are most common on the high-volume commuter routes in South London and to the Sussex, Kent & South Essex coasts. It shares the same bodyshell and core structure as the Turbostar, which is in turn the most common post-privatisation diesel multiple unit family. All of the Electrostar fleet were assembled at Bombardierâ€™s Derby works. Category:Bombardier multiple units Category:Adtranz multiple units Category:British Rail electric multiple units",
