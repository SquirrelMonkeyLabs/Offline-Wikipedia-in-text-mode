 "text": "The Eras Tour was Taylor Swift's sixth concert tour. It began on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona. It will finish on December 8, 2024, in Vancouver. The tour is for all of her albums. Each concert was over three hours, and Taylor Swift sang more than 44 songs. == Background == The last tour before the Eras Tour was the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. Swift was going to do a tour called Lover Fest in 2020 for her album Lover (2019) but it got cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic (due to this, places like Brazil that had a show schedule that got cancelled, got a pre-selling day). On the week Swift released her album Midnights, her website in the United Kingdom said she was going to go on tour. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on October 24, 2022, Swift said that she \"should [go on tour]\" and that \"when it's time, [she will] do it\". Then, 4 days later, on The Graham Norton Show, she said a tour would happen \"soon-ish\". On November 1, 2022, Swift announced the Eras Tour on Good Morning America and she said it is \"a journey through the musical eras of [her] career\". She started the tour in the United States in 2023. At each concert, there are two opening acts and they change every few days. == Ticketmaster controversy == With the exception of two cities, the tickets for the concerts were sold only on Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment. Because a lot of people tried to buy tickets to the concert, the website had a lot of issues and it was very hard to get tickets. They said \"the site was unprepared to accommodate the sheer force of hundreds of thousands of Swift fans\" and that hundreds of thousands of tickets were sold. Some congresspeople, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Amy Klobuchar, said that Ticketmaster violated competition laws. The United States Department of Justice started investigating Ticketmaster. == Movie == The Eras Tour Los Angeles concert at SoFi Stadium was recorded and made into a movie. It was played at movie theaters in North America for four weekends starting on October 13, 2023. It was directed by Sam Wrench. A second Eras Tour movie is speculated to be in the works after fans noticed film crews present onstage during all three final shows in Vancouver, Canada. Many have suggested that this second edition of the film may aim to include the Tortured Poets Department set, which was not featured in the original film. Others believe it could be part of a documentary about the making of the Eras Tour, as film crews were also spotted backstage filming Swift after the show. == Set list == === March 2023 to March 2024 === These are the songs that Taylor Swift performed on the first night of the tour. Most of the tour was similar, but sometimes she changes the setlist. All changes are listed below, and so are the surprise songs.

Since then, she has played \"The 1\" instead of \"Invisible String\". The only other time since then that she sang \"Invisible String\" was at Nashville night 2, because they named a bench after her. * On the days that Phoebe Bridgers was at the show, Bridgers and Swift sang \"Nothing New\" together after the song \"I Knew You Were Trouble\". * Since July 7, 2023, \"Long Live\" has been played after \"Enchanted\" because of the Speak Now (Taylor's Version) album.
