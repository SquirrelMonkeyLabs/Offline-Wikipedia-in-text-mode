 "text": "Amerant Bank Arena is a sports arena in Sunrise, Florida. It opened on October 3, 1998. It is the current home to the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). The arena was also known as the Broward County Civic Arena in 1998, the National Car Rental Center from 1998 to 2002, Office Depot Center from 2002 to 2005, BankAtlantic Center from 2005 to 2012, BB&T; Center from 2012 to 2021, and FLA Live Arena from 2021 until 2023. The most recent name change was in September 2021, when the naming rights contract between the arena and the financial services company BB&T; ran out. By that time, BB&T; had merged with SunTrust Banks to form Truist Financial Corporation. The merged company decided to not renew the naming rights agreement, and the arena now has the temporary name of FLA Live Arena until a new rights partner is found. On September 19, 2023, Amerant Bank bought the naming rights for the arena and it would be renamed to Amerant Bank Arena. The arena currently seats 20,737 for basketball and 19,250 for hockey. The arena was also home to the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA from 2005 to 2006 and the Florida Bobcats of the AFL from 1999 to 2001. On June 27, 2018, an open casket public funeral service for rapper XXXTentacion was held at the arena. Thousands of fans showed up including rappers Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Yachty. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Sports buildings in Florida Category:Buildings and structures in Miami Category:1998 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Florida Category:Florida Panthers",
