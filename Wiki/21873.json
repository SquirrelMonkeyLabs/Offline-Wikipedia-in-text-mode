 "text": "A landlocked country is country with no access to any oceans or seas. As an example, Austria is landlocked. France is not landlocked because it has access to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean. A sea is also landlocked if does not have access to an ocean. This is also called an endorheic basin. As an example, the Caspian Sea is landlocked. The Gulf of Mexico is not landlocked because it has access to the Atlantic Ocean. If a country is landlocked by landlocked countries (surrounded by landlocked countries), then it is doubly landlocked. Liechtenstein and Uzbekistan are the only two doubly landlocked countries in the world. == List of landlocked countries and landlocked de facto states == Country Area (km2) Population Continent Region Neighbouring countries Number of countries Number of countries with ocean access 652,230 33,369,945 Asia Southern Asia China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan 6 3 468 77,543 Europe Southern Europe France and Spain 2 2 29,743 3,000,756 Asia Western Asia Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and Turkey 4 3 83,871 9,027,999 Europe Western Europe Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland 8 3 86,600 10,353,296 Asia Western Asia Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Russia, and Turkey 5/6 4 207,600 9,255,524 Europe Eastern Europe Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine 5 5 38,394 691,141 Asia Southern Asia China and India 2 2 1,098,581 12,054,379 Americas South America Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru 5 4 582,000 2,384,246 Africa Southern Africa Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe 4 2 274,222 21,935,389 Africa Western Africa Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Togo 6 4 27,834 11,865,821 Africa Eastern Africa DR Congo, Rwanda, and Tanzania 3 2 622,984 5,454,533 Africa Middle Africa Cameroon, Chad, the Congo, DR Congo, South Sudan, and the Sudan 6 4 1,284,000 17,963,211 Africa Middle Africa Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Libya, Niger, Nigeria, and the Sudan 6 4 78,867 10,516,707 Europe Eastern Europe Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia 4 2 17,364 1,160,164 Africa Southern Africa Mozambique and South Africa 2 2 1,104,300 113,656,596 Africa Eastern Africa Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Somaliland, South Sudan, and the Sudan 6/7 5/6 93,028 9,689,010 Europe Eastern Europe Austria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine 7 4 2,724,900 19,644,100 Asia Central Asia China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan 5 2 10,908 1,806,279 Europe Southern Europe Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia 4 2 199,951 6,071,750 Asia Central Asia China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan 4 1 236,800 7,749,595 Asia South-eastern Asia Cambodia, China, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam 5 5 30,355 2,281,454 Africa Southern Africa South Africa 1 1 160 35,789 Europe Western Europe Austria and Switzerland 2 0 2,586 502,202 Europe Western Europe Belgium, France, and Germany 3 3 118,484 20,091,635 Africa Eastern Africa Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia 3 2 1,240,192 21,473,764 Africa Western Africa Algeria, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal 7 5 33,846 3,559,500 Europe Eastern Europe Romania, Transnistria, and Ukraine 2/3 2 1,566,500 3,227,863 Asia Eastern Asia China and Russia 2 2 147,181 30,666,598 Asia Southern Asia China and India 2 2 1,267,000 24,484,587 Africa Western Africa Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Libya, Mali, and Nigeria 7 4 25,713 1,836,713 Europe Southern Europe Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, and Serbia 4/5 3 406,752 7,356,409 Americas South America Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil 3 2 26,338 12,955,736 Africa Eastern Africa Burundi, DR Congo, Tanzania, and Uganda 4 2 61 31,716 Europe Southern Europe Italy 1 1 88,361 6,690,887 Europe Southern Europe Albania (via Kosovo and Metohija), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Romania 8 5/6 49,035 5,460,185 Europe Eastern Europe Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine 5 2 3,900 72,000 Asia Western Asia Georgia and Russia 2 2 644,329 11,544,905 Africa Eastern Africa The Central African Republic, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Sudan, and Uganda 6 3 41,284 8,636,896 Europe Western Europe Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Liechtenstein 5 3 143,100 9,119,347 Asia Central Asia Afghanistan, China, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan 4 1 4,163 505,153 Europe Eastern Europe Moldova and Ukraine 2 1 488,100 5,636,011 Asia Central Asia Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan 4 1 241,038 45,853,778 Africa Eastern Africa DR Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Tanzania 5 3 449,100 36,001,262 Asia Central Asia Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan 5 0 0.49 826 Europe Southern Europe Italy 1 1 752,612 19,610,769 Africa Eastern Africa Angola, Botswana, DR Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe 8 5 390,757 15,121,004 Africa Eastern Africa Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia 4 2 Total 14,776,228 475,818,737 N/A Percentage of the World 9.9% 5.9% : Has a coastline on the inland saltwater Caspian Sea : Has limited international recognition : Landlocked by a single country : Doubly landlocked == Related pages == * Endorheic basin Category:Political geography",
