 "text": "Neutralization occurs when a base is reacted with an acid. The OH- ions in the base react with the H+ ions in the acid to form H2O, water. In this reaction, the base is protonated and the acid is deprotonated. To neutralise a substance (e.g alkali substance), you must put an equal amount of an acid into the alkali in order for it to become neutral (has a pH of 7). Titration uses neutralization to measure chemical concentrations. ==Related pages== *Base (chemistry) *Acid *Buffer solution *Protonation *Deprotonation *Alkali Category:Physical chemistry Category:Analytical chemistry Category:Thermodynamics",
