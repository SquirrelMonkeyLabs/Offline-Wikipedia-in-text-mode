 "text": "Promiscuity is the practice of having casual sex frequently with different partners. In cultures where sexual activity happens only in exclusive committed relationships, promiscuity is criticized as a bad activity. A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous is a one-night stand. What sexual behavior is considered promiscuous varies between cultures, as does the frequency of promiscuity. A study published in 2005 found that promiscuous men and women are judged equally harshly. A recent poll showed that both genders tend to express strong preference for sexually conservative partners. However, later studies show evidence for a double standard.http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1155&context;=psych_honproj Promiscuity is common in many animal species.Lipton, Judith Eve & Barash, David P. 2001. The myth of monogamy: fidelity and infidelity in animals and people. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman. Some species have promiscuous mating systems, ranging from polyandry and polygyny to mating systems with no stable relationships. Many species form stable pair bonds, but still mate with other individuals outside the pair. == References == Category:Sexuality Category:Free love",
