 "text": "The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a major event in the American Civil Rights Movement. It happened in Montgomery, Alabama, where city transportation was segregated. Black passengers were required by law to ride in the back of the bus. On December 1, 1955 Rosa Parks, an African American woman, refused to give her bus seat to a white person. She was arrested, jailed, and fined 14 dollars. In protest about 40,000 black people boycotted the Montgomery city buses, refusing to ride. The boycott lasted 381 days.Joyce A. Hanson, Rosa Parks: A Biography (Westport, CT: Greenwood; Brighton: Roundhouse, 2010.), p. xi On November 13, 1956, the United States Supreme Court ruled that buses should be de-segregated. In response, the city of Montgomery passed a law allowing black passengers to sit anywhere on the buses. The boycott ended on December 20, 1956. Many important people in the civil rights movement took part in the boycott. This included Reverend Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Abernathy.Cheryl Fisher Phibbs, The Montgomery Bus Boycott: A History and Reference Guide (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2009), p. 89 == References == Category:1955 in the United States Category:1956 in the United States Category:American civil rights Category:Civil disobedience Category:20th century in Alabama",
