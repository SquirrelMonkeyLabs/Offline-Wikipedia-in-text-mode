 "text": "Saturn (Latin: Sāturnus) is a Roman god of agriculture. In Roman mythology, Saturn is the father of Ceres, Jupiter, Veritas, and others. He is associated with time, wealth, and liberation. He is also identified with the Greek titan Kronos, whose rule, often called the Golden Age, is seen as a time of peace and abundance. ==Temple of Saturn== The Temple of Saturn located at the Roman Forum housed the state treasury. In December, the festival of Saturnalia, perhaps the most famous of all the Roman festivals, was held in his honor — it had a public banquet, role reversals, private gift-giving and revelry. The planet Saturn is named after him and the modern English weekday Saturday bears his name. ==Related pages== * Greek mythology * Classical antiquity ==Footnotes== Category:Time and fate gods Category:Roman gods and goddesses",
