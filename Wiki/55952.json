 "text": "Electric power is defined as the power dissipated by an electric circuit. Electric power is a measurement of the rate at which energy is used over a period of time. The SI unit for power is the watt, the unit for energy is the joule, and the unit for time is the second. For a direct current circuit, electric power equals the electric current multiplied by the voltage. When electric current flows through a circuit, it is slowed down by the resistance in the circuit. Devices can convert this current to useful forms of work, such as heat radiation, light emission, mechanical motion, or acoustic vibrations. == Related pages == * Electric power transmission * Electric power distribution * Electrical generator ==References== * Reports on August 2003 Blackout, North American Electric Reliability Council website * * Category:Electricity Category:Electromagnetism",
