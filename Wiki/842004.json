 "text": "The second cholera pandemic is also known as the Asiatic cholera pandemic. It was a cholera pandemic that spread from India to the entire West Asia, then to the United Kingdom and the Americas, and then to China and Japan. The cause of cholera was not known until later in the 19th century. Cholera and typhus are bacterial diseases. Cholera spread by the absence of, or defective, sewage treatment or defective water supply systems. Typhus is spread by lice, chiggers and fleas. == Related pages == *For the disease, see cholera and John Snow. *For the development of modern water treatment, see Joseph Bazalgette. *For another cause of pandemics, see typhus.
