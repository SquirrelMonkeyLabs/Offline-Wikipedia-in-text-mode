 "text": "Butterscotch is a confection (like candy) made from brown sugar, butter and cream. It is a bit like toffee but is made differently. Butterscotch is made by boiling sugar until it is at the \"soft crack\" stage, which is a slightly lower temperature than for toffee. Butterscotch can be used as a sauce for desserts like ice cream. ==Other websites== Category:Candy",
