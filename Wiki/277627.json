 "text": "In particle physics, the electroweak interaction or electroweak force is the description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature which are electromagnetism and the weak interaction. Though different, the theory models show them as two different parts of the same force. It proves that if the universe is hot enough, then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into a combined electroweak force. Sheldon Glashow,Glashow, S. (1959). \"The renormalizability of vector meson interactions.\" Nucl. Phys. 10, 107. Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their works to the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction. ==References== Category:Physics",
