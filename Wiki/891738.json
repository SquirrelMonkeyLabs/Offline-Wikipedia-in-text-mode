 "text": "In the United States and Canada, Mexican Coke, or Mexican Coca-Cola refers to Coca Cola imported from Mexico. It is called Coca Cola de Vidrio (Glass Coca Cola, Coca Cola in a glass bottle) or simply Mexicoke. It has a different taste, because cane sugar is used to make it. In the United States, high- fructose corn syrup is used. A similar situation exists in New Zealand: The local variant uses cane sugar, and the version imported form the US uses high- fructose corn syrup. Category:Soft drinks",
