 "text": "Pier Paolo Pasolini (5 March 1922 â€“ 2 November 1975) was an Italian movie director, poet and writer. Pasolini was born in Bologna and raised in Veneto and Fruili. His poetry was first published when he was 19 years old. He wrote many novels and essays. He wrote his first screenplay in 1954. The first movie he directed was Accattone in 1961. This and many of his other works were controversial during his lifetime. In the years since his death, however, Pasolini has come to be valued by many as a visionary thinker and a major figure in Italian literature and art. Literary critic Harold Bloom considered Pasolini to be a major European poet and a major voice in 20th-century poetry. Pasolini was gay. He was murdered on 2 November 1975. He was run over several times with his own car. He died on the beach at Ostia, near Rome. He was buried in Casarsa, in Friuli. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Pasolini on Filmgalerie451 Category:1922 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Actors from Emilia-Romagna Category:Italian communists Category:Gay men Category:Italian LGBT people Category:Italian movie actors Category:Italian movie directors Category:Italian murder victims Category:Italian poets Category:Italian screenwriters Category:LGBT actors Category:LGBT directors Category:LGBT poets Category:LGBT screenwriters Category:People from Bologna Category:People from Veneto Category:People murdered in Italy Category:Unsolved murders Category:20th-century Italian writers",
