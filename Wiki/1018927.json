 "text": "The Mike Pence 2024 presidential campaign began on June 5, 2023, when former Vice President of the United States Mike Pence filed his candidacy for the 2024 United States presidential election with the Federal Election Commission. He officially announced his campaign at a rally in Iowa on June 7, 2023. Polling put Pence far behind former President of the United States Donald Trump and incumbent Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis. This caused political analysts to say that his chances of winning the Republican Party nomination were rather low. Pence ended his campaign on October 28, 2023 after low polling numbers. == References == Pence",
