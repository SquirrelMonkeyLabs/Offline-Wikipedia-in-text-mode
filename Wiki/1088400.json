 "text": "Hamas of Iraq (Arabic: حَمَاسُ الْعِرَاقِ) is a Sunni militant group from Iraq, being created from a split in the 1920 Revolution Brigades in 2007. The group has released videos of them attacking US troops. The 1920 Revolution Brigades say that they work with the US army against Al-Qaeda. The group later helped free cities from Daesh in 2015 and gave them to the Iraqi army. The group is mainly made out of former 1920 Revolution Brigades members who were formerly members of Saddam Husayn (ra)'s army. The goal of the group was to free the country from foreign troops such as the US military. ==References== Category:Militant groups Category:Islamist militant groups",
