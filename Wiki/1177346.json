It lives in Mérida, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog used to live near streams on mountains in cloud forests, but people cut down most of these forests. Scientists first found the frogs under rocks near a small stream near a town called Piñango. Scientists saw the frog 2325 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog near Sierra de La Culata National Park but they did not see it inside the park. ==Young== Now, people hear male frogs calling from next to roads. Scientists think this frog has young the way other frogs in Aromobates do: The female frog lays eggs on land. The male frog carries the tadpoles to water after the eggs hatch. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms and make places to raise animals, for example cows. Scientists think bad chemicals in the water could also hurt this frog and that trout fish that people brought to the frog's home could be hurting the frogs too. Other frogs that live nearby, for example Atelopus pinangoi are catching the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, so scientists think A. walterarpi could catch the disease too. In 2011, scientists went back to the frog's home to look for it and did not find any adults or tadpoles. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
