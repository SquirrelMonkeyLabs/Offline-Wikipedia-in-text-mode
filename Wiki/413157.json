 "text": "Saving Mr. Banks is a 2013 biographical comedy-drama movie. It is based on the real life events during the making of the 1964 Disney movie Mary Poppins. Saving Mr. Banks stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P. L. Travers. Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, Kathy Baker, Rachel Griffiths and Colin Farrell also appear in the movie. Meryl Streep was the first choice to play Travers. Thompson took the part because the studio could not get Streep. Thompson has said the role of P. L. Travers was the most difficult one she's played. Photography began in September 2012. The movie was filmed in the Los Angeles area, and the Disney Studios. Care was taken to keep any post-1964 rides from being caught on film. Saving Mr. Banks was given its world premiere at the London Film Festival on October 20, 2013. It has received much critical praise. The Hollywood Reporter said the movie was an \"affecting if somewhat soft-soaped comedy drama, elevated by excellent performances.\" ==References== Category:2013 drama movies Category:2010s biographical movies Category:American biographical movies Category:American drama movies Category:Disney movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies set in the 1960s",
