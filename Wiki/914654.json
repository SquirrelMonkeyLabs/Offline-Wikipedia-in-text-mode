It included the American Jobs Plan and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as a $3.5 trillion Democratic package that would focus on climate change and social policy. The price was lowered to about $2.2 trillion. The bill was passed 220â€“213 by the House of Representatives on November 19, 2021. However, it did not pass the United States Senate since there is no majority support among Democrats and Republicans. ==References== Category:Joe Biden Category:2021 in the United States",
