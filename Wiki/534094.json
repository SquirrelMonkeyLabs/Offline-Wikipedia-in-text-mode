A salary is where the employer pays an arranged amount at regular intervals (such as a week or month) regardless of hours worked or amount of work done. Commission is usually an extra payment based on the performance of the worker or product. Waged employees may also receive \"tips\" paid directly by clients. They will usually not get the same benefits as those paid with a salary, such as annual leave and sick leave. Wages are usually paid by the hour. This is called an hourly wage. Wages paid by the day are still common. Wage rates may be influenced by market forces (supply and demand), laws, and tradition. Market forces are perhaps more dominant in the United States, while tradition, social structure and seniority, perhaps play a greater role in Japan. â€“ Education 2020 Homeschool console, Vocabulary Assignment, definition entry for \"wage rate\" (may require login to view) In many countries, laws set a minimum wage that all employers must pay their workers.
