 "text": "Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 â€“ 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler turned author. He was known as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases. At his peak he smuggled as much as 30 tons, and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and handed a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 different aliases, he became known as \"Mr Nice\" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice. After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation. On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer. He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.\"'Mr Nice' Howard Marks dies aged 70\", The Guardian, 10 April 2016 ==References== Category:1945 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Welsh writers Category:Drug traffickers Category:British criminals",
