 "text": "Demonic is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Testament. It was released in 1997. The lyrics deal with occult themes more like their 1980s efforts instead of the political topics covered on more recent releases. Musically, Testament takes a slower, almost death metal oriented approach with grinding guitar riffs and Chuck Billy's vocal work consisting primarily of death growls. This album also marked the first time, as Testament, that the band used the old Legacy pentagram graphic. ==Track listing== # \"Demonic Refusal\" – 5:21 # \"The Burning Times\" – 5:15 # \"Together as One\" – 4:17 # \"Jun-Jun\" – 3:43 # \"John Doe\" – 3:11 # \"Murky Waters\" – 3:00 # \"Hatred's Rise\" – 3:15 # \"Distorted Lives\" – 3:36 # \"New Eyes of Old\" – 3:00 # \"Ten Thousand Thrones\" – 4:37 # \"Nostrovia\" – 1:32 # \"Rapid Fire\" (Judas Priest cover) (2008 reissue bonus track) - 3:42 ==Credits== * Chuck Billy: Vocals * Eric Peterson: Guitar * Derrick Ramirez: Bass * Gene Hoglan: Drums * Glen Alvelais: Lead guitar on track 9 * Dave McKean: Album cover artwork Bonus Track: Rapid Fire * Greg Christian: Bass * James Murphy: Lead guitar * Chris Kontos: Drums Category:1997 albums",
