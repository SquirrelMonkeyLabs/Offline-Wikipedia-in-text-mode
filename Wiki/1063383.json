 "text": "Pseudophilautus zal is a frog. It lived in Sri Lanka. The adult male frog was 24.2-25.4 mm long from nose to rear end. Scientists do not know what color this frog was when it was alive. When it is in liquid that stops its body from rotting, this frog looks light brown with five white spots on its back and a yellow belly. This frog is extinct. All the frogs of this species are dead. Scientists believe this is because human beings changed the places where the frog needed to live. This frog's scientific name zal comes from a Polish word meaning \"very big sadness.\" The scientists named it \"zal\" because they were sad that so many frogs and other animals in Sri Lanka had died. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
