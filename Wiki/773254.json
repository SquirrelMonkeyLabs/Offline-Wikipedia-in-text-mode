 "text": "Cock and ball torture is a sexual activity that is based on causing pain to the male genitals. It is used in BDSM. Cock and ball torture works by constricting or hurting the penis or the scrotum. Methods for cock and ball torture include wax play (dripping low-temperature wax on the body to create a burning sensation), kicking, and mild electric shocks. The person who enjoys having these things done to them may feel physical pleasure from cock and ball torture because of masochism, or emotional pleasure from knowing that the torture gives pleasure to a sadistic partner. Many cock and ball torture activities carry the risk of injury to the person being tortured. == References == Category:BDSM Category:Sexual acts Category:Paraphilias Category:Male reproductive system",
