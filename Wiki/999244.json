 "text": "A drinking game is a game that takes place in a social setting. In a drinking game, people have to drink alcoholic beverages, according to certain rules. If the drinking game is happening in a bar, or a restaurant, these rules also include who has to order the drinks, and who has to pay for them. Drinking games are dangerous, because peer pressure can make people drink more than they should. This is one of the reasons why drinking games are popular with young people. Drinking games have existed since antiquity. Usually a drinking game includes several of the following: * Chance / Luck: there's a random event, and if it has a certain outcome the player is lucky. * Rituals: A candidate in a group has to perform a certain ritual * Skill: A given problem needs to be solved using skill (such as balancing something) * Sports games: like carrying a case filled with beer bottles over a given distance, and having to empty all bottles before reaching the target line",
