 "text": "The flag of Abkhazia contains 7 stripes alternating from green to white. In the top left corner of the flag is the open palm of a right hand, placed on top of a red background. Above the hand are 7 stars shaped as a semicircle. The stars represent the 7 main historical Abkhazian regions. == History == The flag of Abkhazia was designed by the Abkhaz artist Valery Gamgia in 1991. Gamgia was inspired by the flag of the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus (MRNC) which, just like Gamgia's flag, featured a design of 7 stripes and 7 stars. Gamgia's design became the official flag of Abkhazia on July 23, 1992; the same day Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia. == References == Abkhazia Category:Abkhazia",
