Today, the little landmark is in use as a symbol for the German town Flensburg.Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: Flensburg, 29 == History == In 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its town wall. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called Norder Porte. It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor.Werner Scharnweber: Flensburg, 29 This marked the northern boundary of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night.Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: Flensburg, Glossary: Nordertor On the north side of the gate are two plaques. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King Christian IV, 1577-1648 and the Latin words: „Regna Firmat Pietas“ — Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the German words: „Friede ernährt, Unfrieden verzehrt“ — Peace nurtures, strife devours. There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was restored in the time of Christian VII, 1749-1808.Compare Flensburger Straßennamen.
