 "text": "A Khachkar or Khatchkar (\"Խաչքար\" in Armenian, meaning \"cross-stone\", pronounced as ) is a carved memorial stone found in Armenia. It has a crucifix or cross, with a rosette or sun circle below it. Other parts can be filled with patterns of leaves, grapes or knots. Sometimes it has a ledge at the top with saints' or characters from the bible. Much of the time a khachkar is put up for religious reasons such as the salvation of the soul of a living or a dead person. They have also been removed for other reasons, such as to show a military win, building of a new church, or as a protection from natural disasters. Most Khachkars are in graveyards. But Armenian gravestones take many other forms, and only a small are khatchkars. ==Gallery== File:Armenian 'khachkar'.jpg|Armenian Khachkar File:Armenian 'khachkar' 1.jpg|Armenian Khachkar == Other websites == * Khachkar.am * Khatchkar collection at Armenica.org Category:Armenian culture Category:Monuments and memorials",
