 "text": "Vaginal lubrication is wetness when a woman is sexually excited. This wetness is useful for when a woman wants to have sex. If she is not wet the sex may become painful for her. Vaginal lubrication is also good for stopping injuries or tearing of the inner vagina. If a woman doesn't have enough lubrication naturally, she can buy lubricant which is similar to natural lubricant. == References == == Other websites == *Mayo Clinic - Vaginal dryness *Menopause Symptoms - Vaginal dryness Category:female reproductive system",
