This resolution asked for greater Muslim autonomy of Muslim majority states such as Punjab, Bengal, Sindh and NWFP within British India. However, later on most people thought of this as a call for a separate Muslim state, Pakistan.Christoph Jaffrelot (Ed.) (2005), A History of Pakistan and Its Origins, Anthem Press, The resolution was presented at Minto Park (now renamed 'Iqbal Park'), in Lahore, by Maulvi A.K. Fazlul Huq on the instructions of the Working Committee.Atiq Zafar Sheikh (1994) The Lahore Resolution 1940 Islamabad: National Archives of Pakistan Publications, p.89 In fact, from the declaration made in this resolution in 1940 onwards, the goals of the Muslim League became increasingly fixed upon achieving an independent nation-state. Today, the resolution's importance is remembered in Pakistan, by the Minar-e-Pakistan structure that stands in the Greater Iqbal Park, Lahore. So fair ideas of Muslims separated had been floating in Indian political atmosphere. == Committee == The following is the full list of the 25 original, formally designated members of the Special Working Committee of the All India Muslim League, 1940, which met between 21 and 24 March 1940,Programme of the All India Muslim Leagues 27th Annual Session, to be held at Lahore 21st to 24th March 1940, at the National Archives of Pakistan, Islamabad, the Quaid-e-Azam Papers, File 1354 and which largely drafted the Lahore Resolution.Atiq Zafar Sheikh, The Pakistan Resolution and the Muslim League's Working Committee 1940 Islamabad: NAP Publications, 1994, pp. 87-91 * Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah * Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan * Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan * Sir Shahnawaz Khan Mamdot * Amir Ahmed Khan Raja Sahib of Mahmudabad * Sher-e-Bangla A.K.
