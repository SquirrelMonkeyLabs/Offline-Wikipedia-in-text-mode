 "text": "A deputy prime minister is a government minister who can take the position of the current prime minister when the prime minister is not available. For example, the vice prime minister is often asked to do the prime minister's work if the prime minister dies or is incapacitated (cannot do the job due to illness, injury, etc.), has too much work or does not have the time, to do every duty. In some countries, a prime minister has more than one deputy prime minister. == Related pages == * Vice president 2 Category:Government occupations",
