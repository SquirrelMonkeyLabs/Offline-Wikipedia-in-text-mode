He began piano at age 14. He studied piano at the Curtis Institute of Music, with Mieczyslaw Horszowski and composition with Constant Vauclain. In December 1966, he made his debut in New York at The Town Hall concert theatre, playing mostly his own compositions. In 1970, Eastman joined the Center for the Creative and Performing Arts at SUNY Buffalo, where he met the Czech-born composer, conductor, and flute player Petr Kotik. Eastman and Kotik played together in the early to mid 1970s. Eastman was a maker of the S.E.M. Ensemble. From 1971 he performed and traveled with the group. In 1974, Eastman was nominated for a Grammy award for his vocal performance of Eight Songs for a Mad King by Peter Maxwell Davies.
