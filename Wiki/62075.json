Estimated dates vary from 284 to 314. Garsoïan (op.cit. p.82), following the research of Ananian, favours the latter. That occured in the early 4th century and is traditionally dated to 301 (after Mikayel Chamchian 1784). The church teaches that Gregory was imprisoned by Tiridates in an underground pit, called Khor Virab, for 13 years, and then treated Tiridates of an incurable disease, which made him accept Christianity. The church's tradition is that it originated in the missions of two Apostles of Jesus Bartholomew and Thaddeus, in the 1st century. The church would therefore be one of the oldest denominations of Christianity. == References == ==Related pages== * Hnevank * Armenian Catholic Church == Other websites == * The Armenian Church * Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia * Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem * Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople * Araratian Patriarchal Diocese * Diocese of the Armenian Church of Canada * Diocese of the Armenian Church of America (Eastern) * The Diocese of the Armenian Church of America (Western) * New Armenian Apostolic Church Library of Books and Video * Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) Church Library Online: English | Armenian | Russian * Prayer Book of the Armenian Church * Armeniapedia - Armenian Apostolic Church * Some information * Basic info * Embassy of the Republic of Armenia to the US General Information * Directory of Armenian Churches Worldwide Category:Oriental Orthodoxy Category:3rd-century establishments",
