Notable incidents include 2022 missile explosion in Poland, the 2023 Belgorod Oblast incursions, and the Wagner Group rebellion. == In Russia == === June 2023 === On 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group rebelled against the Ministry of Defense after Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation were attacked Wagner forces in Ukraine. In response, Wagner seized control of Rostov-on-Don and began advancing northwards along the M4 highway towards Moscow. By 24 June, Wagner rebels had shot down four Russian Air Force helicopters and captured Voronezh. Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the rebellion as treasonous. After entering Moscow Oblast, Wagner halted their advance and entered negotiations with Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Following the negotiations, Wagner withdrew from occupied territory and relocated their base of operations to Belarus. == References == Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine",
