 "text": "Pig iron is iron with a high carbon content. Pig iron is made by smelting iron ore into ingot form, in a blast furnace. Itâ€™s called pig iron because when being cast, each ingot being cast looks like a Piglet suckling milk from a sow. ==History== Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese knew about pig iron, and were producing it as early as 1100 BC. ==Uses== Pig iron is refined into Wrought iron by melting it and blowing hot air through it. Pig iron can also be turned into gray iron. ==Modern Uses== Originally, pig iron was poured out the bottom of the furnace and shipped to a steel mill for processing. Now, we turn the metal into pellets before shipping it. Category:Iron",
