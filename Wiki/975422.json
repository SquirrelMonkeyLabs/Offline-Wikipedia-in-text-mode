 "text": "NGC 55 is a Magellanic type barred spiral galaxy located about 6.5 million light years away in the constellation Sculptor. Along with its neighbor NGC 300, it is one of the closest galaxies to the Local Group, probably lying between the Milky Way and the Sculptor Group. It has an estimated mass of (2.0 ± 0.4) × 1010 M☉. == Nearby galaxies and group information == NGC 55 and the spiral galaxy NGC 300 have permanently been identified as members of the Sculptor Group, a nearby group of galaxies in the constellation of Sculptor. However, recent distance measurements point to that the two galaxies actually lie in the foreground. It is likely that NGC 55 and NGC 300 form a gravitationally bound pair. == References == Category:Barred spiral galaxies",
