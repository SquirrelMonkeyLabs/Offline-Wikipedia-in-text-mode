 "text": "Phoebus (means shining-one) was first appeared in the Illiad a name of the Greek god Apollo. But later, in Roman era, Apollo was conflated with Helios, who was the Sun god in Greece. As both gods were merged (became one) in that period, their myths also conflated. Ovid refered to both as \"Phoebus\", so we could see this name in Ovid's myths of Helios and Apollo.
