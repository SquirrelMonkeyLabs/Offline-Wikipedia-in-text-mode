 "text": "Ameerega shihuemoy is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog is 19.2 to 21.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 21.5 to 25.7 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is black in color with bumps and some copper-brown color near the middle of the back. There is a stripe or orange spot from the rear end to the tops of the back legs. The stripe then goes over the eye to the nose. The sides of the body can be blue-green or black in color. There is a white stripe from the mouth over the eyes and nose to where the front leg meets the body. The tops of the legs are brown in color with some black and green. The frog's belly and bottoms of the legs and feet are blue with some black marks or black with blue marks. ==Home== This frog lives in forests in low places and on hills. It lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that were gone and are growing back. People see it near rocky streams and near water that is not there all year. This frog hides in holes, between big rocks, and under roots. People have seen it between 340 and 850 meters above sea level. The frog lives near one protected park, Manu Biosphere Reserve. ==Young== The male frog sits on top of a rock or on the dead leaves on the ground and calls to the female frogs. He does this all year. The female frog lays eggs in holes in rocks. She lays 22-25 eggs at a time. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, he carries the tadpoles to water that does not move fast. The tadpoles are dark brown in color with black spots. Their tails are clear with dark spots. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms to grow their own food, to build roads, to get wood to build with even though this is against the law, and to dig good rocks out of the ground. Some of the digs are legal and some are against the law. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
