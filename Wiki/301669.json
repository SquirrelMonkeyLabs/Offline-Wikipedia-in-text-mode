 "text": "Nawaz Sharif (, ; born 25 December 1949) is a Pakistani politician and businessmen. He served as the 12th Prime Minister of Pakistan for three non- consecutive terms from November 1990-July 1993, February 1997-October 1999, and June 2013-July 2017. He is the longest-serving prime minister of Pakistan, having served a total of more than 9 years across three tenures. He was the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1985 to 1990. Born into the upper-middle-class Sharif family in Lahore, Nawaz is the son of Muhammad Sharif, the founder of Ittefaq and Sharif groups. He is a wealthy businessman and a conservative politician. His first term was shortened after the Pakistan Army pressured him to resign. In 1997, he was overwhelmingly elected for a second term by a wide margin. During his second term, he notably ordered Pakistan's first nuclear test in response to India's aggressive nuclear tests. He was ousted in an October 1999 military coup by Pervez Musharraf. He returned to Pakistan in late 2007 after eight years of exile. He successfully called for Musharraf's impeachment and the reinstatement of former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chuadhry. On 28 July 2017, after a direct ruling from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Sharif resigned as Prime Minister due to his role in the Panama Papers case. In December 2019, Sharif was diagnosed with heart disease. == Sources == Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Anti- communists Category:Billionaires Category:Pakistani businesspeople Category:Government ministers Category:Pakistani lawyers Category:Pakistani Muslims Category:Prime ministers of Pakistan Category:Politicians from Lahore",
