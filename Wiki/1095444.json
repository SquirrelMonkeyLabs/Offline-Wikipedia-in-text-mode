 "text": "The Sam Browne belt is a type of military and police belt, which has a strap that passes diagonally over the right shoulder. It was designed by British General Samuel Browne of the British Indian Army in the 19th century. Browne had lost his left arm, making it difficult for him to draw his saber. To draw the saber, the sheath had to be stabilized with the other hand at the same time as the weapon was drawn. To solve this, Browne came up with the idea of inventing a strap that would pass diagonally over the shoulder opposite the scabbard. Other officers began wearing similar equipment and it eventually became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, it was copied by other troops and eventually became standard. In the second half of the 20th century, its use is not common, only being worn in gala uniformity. Category:Military uniform",
