This usually includes things like how to make babies, how to protect against unwanted pregnancies, and how not to get any of the sexually transmitted diseases there are. It should also include the fact that men and women are anatomically different, how the sex organs work, and what happens during puberty, when children change into adults In many cultures speaking about sex or sexual education is a taboo. Some level of sex education is also done in school; in many places, the government passed laws that say that sex education must be done in school. Some parts of sex education vary by culture, e.g. the moral and ethic aspects. == Other websites == * SIECUS Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States Category:Human sexuality",
