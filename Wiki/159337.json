 "text": "Sir John de Menteith (c. 1275 – c. 1323) was a Scottish nobleman. On August 3, 1305, William Wallace was captured at Robroyston, near Glasgow. His captor, Sir John Menteith, the ‘false’ Menteith, has gone down in Scottish legend as the betrayer of Wallace. It is believed he acted as many others would have under the pressure of King Edward II of England. Menteith was no English lackey, and in 1320 he put his seal to the Declaration of Arbroath. == Other websites == * History of the Earldom of Menteith (Electric Scotland) Category:1270s births Category:1320s deaths Category:Scottish politicians Category:Signatories to the Declaration of Arbroath",
