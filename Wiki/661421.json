 "text": "\"Louie Louie\" is a rhythm and blues song written by Richard Berry in 1955 and best known for the 1963 hit version by The Kingsmen. It is a rock standard. \"Louie Louie\" tells, in simple verse–chorus form, the first-person story of a Jamaican sailor returning to the island to see his lady love. The Kingsmen's cover recording was the subject of an FBI investigation about the supposed but nonexistent obscenity of the lyrics, an investigation that ended without prosecution. Ironically, the recording notably includes the drummer yelling \"Fuck!\" after dropping his drumstick at the 0:54 mark. While the Kingsmen's version did not top the Billboard chart, it did reach #1 on Cashbox for two weeks, and it was the last #1 before Beatlemania hit the United States with \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". The Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie\" is considered the epitome of garage rock and is often considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time.
