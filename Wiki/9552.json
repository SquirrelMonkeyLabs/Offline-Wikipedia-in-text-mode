 "text": "Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch, is a creature in folklore. It is said that they are primates living in remote areas of Canada and the United States (US), most commonly in the Pacific Northwest. ==Spotting== There have been many claims of Bigfoots being seen, but no one has ever captured one, or found a dead body. So, most people do not believe in Bigfoot. Bigfoot is said to be very tall, from 7 to 9 feet (about 2 to 2.75 meters) and covered in brown, black, red, or sometimes even white fur or hair. They are said to have very big feet, about 13 inches long (0.3 meters), which is the reason why they are named Bigfoot. ==Naming== The name Sasquatch comes from the Halkomelem language, a Central Salish language in the Salish language family. Stories of this type of creature are known among a number of First Nations groups in south-western British Columbia, Canada. ==Similar mythical creatures== Bigfoot is similar to another mythical creature, the Yeti of the Himalayas.
