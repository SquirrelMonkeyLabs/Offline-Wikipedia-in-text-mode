 "text": "A role (sometimes spelled r√¥le) or a social role can be described as an expected behaviour of an individual. More precisely one could say it is a set of connected behaviours, rights and duties that a person has to follow in a social situation. It depends on social status. Role confusion is a situation where an individual has trouble to decide which role he/she should play. For example, one could be a student who would attend a meeting of a particular recreational interest and find her teacher there. They would be in conflict between behaving as a student and as an enthusiast who shares the same interest as the teacher. Category:Sociology",
