The headquarters of the campaign is in Burke, Virginia. ==Background== On November 19, 2014, Webb announced the formation of an exploratory committee in preparation for a possible bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. He reaffirmed his moderate stances as a strength to a potential candidacy, including some criticisms of the Affordable Care Act despite having voted for it, and emphasized his belief that the Democratic Party had been neglecting the \"white, working-class\" vote in favor of pandering to minorities. ==Campaign== Webb formally announced his candidacy on July 2, 2015 via his campaign website. He suspended his campaign and withdrew from the election on October 20, 2015. ==References== Webb",
