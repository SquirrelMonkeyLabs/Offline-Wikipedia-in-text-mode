According to the relevant Basic Law, the elections were required to be held no later than the third Tuesday of the Hebrew month of Cheshvan four years after the previous elections, making the latest possible date 31 October 2023. However, due to the failed attempts to form a government by 11 December after the September elections, early elections were called, the third within a year. On 20 April 2020, Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu announced that an agreement on a unity government had been reached following the election. The deal would involve both parties splitting power and Gantz and Netanyahu taking turns being prime minister. The deal says Gantz will be Vice Prime Minister until October 2021, by then he will become Prime Minister. ==References== Category:2020 elections in Asia Category:March 2020 events 2020 Category:2020s in Israel",
