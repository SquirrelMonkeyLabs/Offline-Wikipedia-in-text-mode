In this conflict Devapala of Pala Empire came into Conflict with the tibetans like his father Dharmapala. ==Background== During the period when Dharmapala's reign was ending and Devapala's reign was beginning, the Pratihāra ruler Nagabhatta attacked the Palas and the Tibetan Empire was allied with the Pratihāras in their attack on the Palas. The Tibetans, led by Mu-tig Btsan-po, claims to have defeated Dharmapala, while his successor Ralpacan claims that they had successfully subdued Gangāsāgara. These events took place near the end of Dharmapala's rule and the start of Devapala's reign. Devapala also engaged in conflict with the Tibetan kings like his father Dharmapala. ==Conflicts== Devapala successfully expelled the Pratiharas from the western regions of Bihar, as evidenced by his grants issued in the Patna region (known as Srinagara bhukti) and in the Gaya regions (Gaya district). The Emperors of Tibet, Khri-srong-lda-btsan (Trisong Detsen) and his son, Mu-teg-btsan-po (Ralpacan), who claimed to have conquered India and made Dharmapāla submit, fought against Devapala, the son of Dharmapala. In this battle, the Tibetan Emperors were defeated by Devapala. An inscription belonging to Devapāla states that he freed all of the Himalayas from Tibetan rule. According to Chinese historical records, Tibetan control over the Himalayas was lost during Devapāla's reign, from 839 to 848 AD. == Aftermath == Devapala's conquest of the Himalayas is confirmed by the Dullu inscription of King Prithvimalla, which mentions fifteen Pala rulers ruling over Nepal. The first Pala king, Adipala, started a new lineage of rulership, continuing for sixteen generations. ==References== Category:Pala Empire Category:Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty Category:Battles involving the Pala Empire",
