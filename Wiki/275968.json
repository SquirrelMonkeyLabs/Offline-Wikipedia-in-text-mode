 "text": "Andrew Lee Isaac Vowles (born 10 November 1967, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, England), also known as Mushroom, is a founding member of British trip-hop band Massive Attack. ==Early years== Vowles grew up in Bath. The same time to Massive Attack, Vowles, along with Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall, Nellee Hooper, and others were The Wild Bunch crew, named after a western by Sam Peckinpah. Several members of The Wild Bunch formed Massive Attack. ==Career== Vowles stayed a member of Massive Attack until shortly after the release of their third full-length album, Mezzanine, in 1998. Interviews with band members have pointed to differences of opinion in the direction the band should go; Vowles liking a hip-hop direction while Robert Del Naja and Daddy G leaned more towards darker electronica themes. He also had expressed a dislike for touring, an activity which he characterised as \"pimping\". ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:British musicians Category:Massive Attack Category:Trip hop musicians",
