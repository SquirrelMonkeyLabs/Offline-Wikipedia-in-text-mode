 "text": "Eleanor of Aquitaine (c. 1122 – March 31, 1204) was the daughter of William X of Aquitaine. She had a younger sister called Petronilla of Aquitaine. She brought the province of Aquitaine to England when she married Henry II of England. It stayed under English control for 300 years. ==Life== Eleanor inherited land in France at the age of 15. She married Louis VII of France on July 22, 1137, and had two daughters: * Marie of France * Alix of France The marriage was later annulled, as there were no male children. Eleanor then married Henry II of England on May 18, 1152, and had eight children, including: * William, who died at the age of 3. * Henry the Young King * Richard I of England * John I of England * Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony * Joan/Joanna of England * Eleanor of England Eleanor was greatly known for her work in the Second Crusade, for she inspired many people to join. Eleanor supported a revolt by her children against their father's rule in 1173. This revolt was unsuccessful, and King Henry II was so angry that he locked her away in a prison. In 1189, after King Henry II died and her son, Richard, came to be the king, Eleanor was freed. Ten years later, in 1199, Richard died so she supported her youngest son John to take the English throne against the claim of her grandson Arthur of Brittany. In 1202 during the campaign at Mairebeau, she continued to oppose Arthur. Upon John’s ascension, Eleanor retired to Aquitaine, spending most of her remaining life at a monastery. She died there on April 1, 1204.\"Eleanor of Aquitaine.\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. Detroit: Gale, 1998. Biography In Context. Web. 27 Feb. 2013. \"Eleanor of Aquitaine.\" World Book Advanced.
