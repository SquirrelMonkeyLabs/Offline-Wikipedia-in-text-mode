 "text": "The Taita warty frog or Taita Hills warty frog (Callulina dawida) is a frog. It lives in Kenya. It lives in forests high in the Taita Hills. People have only seen it higher than 1400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog can be as big as 35 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be as big as 55 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is warty and can be dark brown, light brown, dark gray, light gray, or orangish or yellowish in color. This frog lays eggs during the dry season. The female frog lays eggs on the ground in the forest. The female frog sits on the eggs until they all hatch. Small frogs called froglets hatch out of the eggs. They are never tadpoles. Two of the reasons this frog is critically endangered are because it lives in a small place and because human beings change that place. ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
