 "text": "The WAGR Ra class were a total of 14 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1909 to 1948. The Ra class came about as a result of the need for more powerful engines on lightly-laid lines in rural areas. A trailing set of wheels was fitted behind the driving wheels to allow the standard R class to traverse the lighter rails, becoming the Ra class. Several locos were converted to Ra and then converted back to R and then converted to Ra again depending on the needs of the WAGR. Withdrawals for the Ra began in the 1920s as part of a program to replace and upgrade the WAGR's aging fleet of locomotives which resulted from a 1922 Royal Commission. Curiously the Ra designation was abolished in 1933 but those that remained continued operating with Ra specifications under the R designation. No. 174 has been preserved but was converted into its original R class form shortly after withdrawal to represent the class in its original condition, it is now on display at the ARHS Rail Heriateg W.A. Bassendean Railway Museum. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
