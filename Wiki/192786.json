It traditionally was called the \"King of Terriers\" because before the creation of the Black Russian Terrier, the Airedale was largest of the terrier breeds. The breed has also been called the Waterside Terrier, because it was bred to hunt otters in and around the valleys of the River Aire in Airedale.
