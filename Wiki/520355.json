 "text": "A Jesus piece is a spiritual or religious piece of jewelry which shows the face of Jesus. Jesus pieces are popular in the Hip-Hop community. Many Hip-Hop artists and celebrities like The Notorious B.I.G. usually wear Jesus pieces, and will have them decorated with rare or expensive gems (jewels). Less expensive Jesus diamond pieces are also sold. They are made of things like wood or inexpensive metals. ==History== ===The Notorious B.I.G.=== The first Jesus piece was worn by Christopher Wallace (The Notorious B.I.G.). It was made by Tito Caicedo, Wallace's jeweler (jewelry-maker). Wallace had Caicedo make many more Jesus pieces, paying him about $10,000 for each. Wallace had worn some of these Jesus pieces himself, and gave others pieces to his peers. The Jesus pieces were decorated with expensive gems, especially on Jesus's hair. ==References== Category:Jewelry",
