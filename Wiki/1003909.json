 "text": "The inauguration of Benjamin Harrison as the 23rd president of the United States happened on March 4, 1889. It was the start of the only term of Benjamin Harrison as president and Levi P. Morton as vice president. A public ceremony happened on the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The event was the 26th presidential inauguration. Chief Justice Melville Fuller administered the oath of office to Harrison. John James Ingalls administered the vice presidential oath of office to Morton. The inauguration happened during a rainstorm in Washington D.C. Harrison's speech was short, and he spoke about the growth of the United States due to education and religion. He also told the states that harvested cotton and did mining to use the industrial technology the eastern part of the United States had. Harrison also talked about the territories to become US states, and for a raise in pension for veterans. He also talked about the Monroe Doctrine, as well as wanting a better and more modern Navy. John Philip Sousa's band played at the Inaugural Ball. After the inauguration, Harrison stated his desire for an office separate from the White House, saying \"There is only a door – one that is never locked – between the president's office and what are not very accurately called his private apartments. There should be an executive office building, not too far away, but wholly distinct from the dwelling house. For everyone else in the public service there is an unroofed space between the bedroom and the desk.\" == References == == Other websites == * Text of Benjamin Harrison's Inaugural Address Category:1889 in the United States Harrison, Benjamin Category:Benjamin Harrison",
