 "text": "Motoori Norinaga (; 21 June 1730 â€“ 5 November 1801) was a Japanese scholar and poet during the Edo period. Norinaga's most important works include the Kojiki-den (Commentaries on the Kojiki), created more than 35 years ago, and his comments on the Tale of Genji. Motoori was born in what is now Matsusaka in Ise Province (now part of Mie Prefecture). At the age of 22, Motoori went to Kyoto to study medicine. Although best known as a Kokugaku scholar, Norinaga worked as a doctor for 40 years in Matsusaka. He was the first to use the term Mono no aware, which is now an important concept in Japanese culture.
