 "text": "The Pinocchio Paradox, considered a spinoff of the classic Liar paradox, has used the fictional character, Pinocchio. == Paradox introduction == In the fairy tales, Whenever Pinocchio says a lie, his nose grows, and since then people have thought of a paradox that fits it. The Paradox states that Pinocchio says, \"My nose will grow now!\" and since he can't magically grow a nose, it would grow, right? Well, then it wouldn't grow because then his statement would be true, and it wouldn't grow, but by not growing, it's a lie and it's supposed to grow and the cycle repeats. The paradox was invented by Veronique Eldridge Smith, who thought of it as a counter-example to the Liar paradox. == Solution == Pinocchio's nose is a paradoxical bit, but we can put an end to this paradox, by simply assuming that what Pinocchio said is a false prediction. Pinocchio said that his nose would grow, but what he said is only a false assumption, and merely just a guess. Category:Logical paradoxes",
