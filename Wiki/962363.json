The \"3x + 1\" problem also known as the Collatz conjecture was named after him, and is still not solved. The Collatz–Wielandt formula for the Perron–Frobenius theorem was also named after him.

He received his doctorate in 1935 for writing a paper about linear differential equations. He worked as an assistant for the university. Then, he worked at the Technical University of Karlsruhe in 1935. He habilitated (achieved the highest university degree in European countries) in 1937. He worked as a Privatdozent (sign of position given to special students in Europe) from 1938 to 1943. He worked with Alwin Walther at the Institute for Practical Mathematics. Collatz worked at the University of Hamburg from 1952 until 1978. There, he created the Institute of Applied Mathematics. After leaving his job, he continued to be active. ===Honors=== For his work in mathematics, Collatz earned honors, such as: *being elected to the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna and the Academy of Modena in Italy. *becoming an honorary member of the Hamburg Mathematical Society *getting honorary degrees from the University of São Paulo, the Technical University of Vienna, the University of Dundee in Scotland, Brunel University in England, the Leibniz University Hannover in 1981, and the Technical University of Dresden. ===Death=== He died without knowledge from a heart attack in Varna, Bulgaria, while in a mathematics conference. ==Works== * Das Differenzenverfahren mit höherer Approximation für lineare Differentialgleichungen (= Schriften des mathematischen Seminars und des Instituts für angewandte Mathematik der Universität Berlin – Band 3/Heft 1), Leipzig 1935 * Eigenwertprobleme und ihre numerische Behandlung.
