It started off as the World League of American Football and had 3 teams in Europe, 6 in the USA and one in Canada. After 2 years the league was put on hold, so there were no 1993 or 1994 seasons. The league came back in 1995 as a purely European league, with the 3 original European teams plus 3 new ones. In 1998 the name of the league was changed to NFL Europe and then in 2007 it became NFL Europa. After the 2007 season, the NFL ceased operations of the league.
