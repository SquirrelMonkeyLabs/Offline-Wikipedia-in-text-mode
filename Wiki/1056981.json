 "text": "A nutritionist is someone who helps others focus on eating healthy food and have a healthy nutrition in their diets. They also talk about the impacts of what they eat and their health. There are different types of nutritionist that focus on sports nutrition, public health, or animal nutrition, among other disciplines. Sometimes a person can claim to be a nutritionist even without any training, education, or professional license. They are different from being a dietitian, who has a university degree, professional license, and certification for professional practice. A nutritionist specializes in guiding individuals toward healthier eating habits by creating personalized nutrition plans based on lifestyle, health goals, and medical needs. They promote balanced diets, disease prevention, and overall well-being through proper food choices. Nutritionists often collaborate with healthcare providers and stay updated on dietary research to ensure effective, evidence-based recommendations for their clients' health. ==References== Category:Nutrition",
