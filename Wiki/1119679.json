 "text": "The Mabu forest is in Mozambique. It was 'discovered' by Professor Julian Bayliss in 2004. Its size at made Mabu the largest single block of rainforest in southern Africa. A single visit turned up 25 new species, and others which have never been catalogued. These animals and insects have no way of breeding with other populations. They evolve in isolation into animals unique and new to science. Mabu is effectively a sky island, with isolated mountains surrounded by lowlands. Deforestation is not too far gone, but some of the animals are being hunted and eaten. Category:Mozambique Category:Forests",
