It resulted in the Conservatives, led by the current Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home losing. The Labour Party won the election. This meant Harold Wilson would become the new Prime Minister. Labour got a overall majority of four seats. The Labour Party got a lot more votes in Scotland than before. This was the start of them winning most seats in Scotland. They did this until Scottish National Party won more at the 2015 general election. == References == Category:1964 in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom general elections",
