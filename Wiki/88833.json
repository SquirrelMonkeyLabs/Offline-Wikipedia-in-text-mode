 "text": "Pi (uppercase/lowercase Π π), is the letter of the Greek alphabet, used to represent the \"p\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it had a value of 80. Letters that came from it include the Roman P and Cyrillic П. In mathematics, the uppercase pi is used for the Pi product operator (for example. \\Pi_{i=1}^5 i = 5!), similar to the way summation is used. The lowercase pi is used as the mathematical constant pi, also known as Archimedes's constant. == Related pages == * Phi * Tau == References == Category:Greek alphabet",
