 "text": "Andrew of Wyntoun (also known as Andrew de Wyntoun and Andrew Wyntoun) (), was a Scottish poet, a canon of St. Andrew's and a prior (higher-up within the Church) of St. Serf's Inch in Loch Leven. Wyntoun and John Barbour (The Brus, 1375) were the first people to write about history in the Scots language. He wrote a long poetic history of Scotland, called the Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland, which included Scotland's mythical pre-history and finished when King James I came to power. == References == Category:1350s births Category:1420s deaths Category:Scottish poets Category:Historians",
