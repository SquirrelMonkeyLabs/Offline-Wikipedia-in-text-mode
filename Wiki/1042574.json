 "text": "The discography of American R&B; and pop singer and dancer Paula Abdul consists of three studio albums, one remix album, five compilation albums, eight video albums, eighteen singles, and seven other appearances. Having found success as a choreographer for artists such as Janet Jackson, Abdul launched her own music career with the release of her debut studio album Forever Your Girl (1988). The album topped the Billboard 200 chart, and to date holds the record for the longest climb to number one for an album. The project spawned a number of successful singles, and is one of only nine albums to have four singles top the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It went on to earn a seven-times platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). ==Albums== ===Studio albums=== List of studio albums, with selected details, chart positions, sales, and certifications Title Album details Peak chart positions Certifications US AUS CAN For peak positions of Abdul's albums in Canada, use a link depending on a title: * FRA For peak positions of Abdul's albums in France, use the link below searching her name in the field Les \"Charts Runs\" de chaque Album Classé: * GER JPN http://ranking.oricon.co.jp/free_contents/search/ranking_list.asp?itemcd=298361&samecd;=1&chart;_kbn=11A&linkcd;=30009423 NLD NZ SWE UK Forever Your Girl * Released: June 15, 1988 * Label: Virgin (#90943) * Formats: LP, CD, cassette 1 1 1 12 24 95 19 19 6 3 *RIAA: 7× PlatinumFor sales certifications received by Abdul in the US, use the RIAA link: *US - Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) *ARIA: Platinum *BPI: PlatinumFor sales certifications received by Abdul in the UK, use the BPI link: *UK - British Phonographic Industry (BPI) *MC: 7× PlatinumFor sales certifications received by Abdul in Canada, use the CRIA link: *Canada - Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) *RMNZ: Platinum Spellbound * Released: May 14, 1991 * Label: Virgin (#91611) * Formats: LP, CD, cassette 1 3 6 36 17 12 45 14 6 4 *RIAA: 3× Platinum *ARIA: Gold *BPI: Gold *MC: 2× Platinum Head over Heels * Released: June 13, 1995 * Label: Virgin (#40525) * Formats: LP, CD, cassette 18 27 21 — — 32 74 — — 61 *RIAA: Gold \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. ===Compilation albums=== List of compilation albums, with selected details and chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions US R&B; The Greatest * Released: 1998 * Label: Virgin (#VJCP 51044) * Formats: CD — Greatest Hits * Released: September 26, 2000 * Label: Virgin (#48980) * Formats: CD — Greatest Hits: Straight Up! * Released: May 8, 2007 * Label: Virgin (#90527) * Formats: CD, digital download 86 10 Great Songs * Released: June 14, 2011 * Label: Virgin (#83249) * Formats: CD, digital download 46 Icon * Released: October 8, 2013 * Label: Virgin (#B0018870-02) * Formats: CD — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. ===Remix albums=== List of remix albums, with selected details, chart positions, and certifications Title Album details Peak chart positions Certifications US AUS CAN FRA GER NLD NZ SWE UK Shut Up and Dance: Mixes * Released: May 8, 1990 * Label: Virgin (#91362) * Formats: LP, CD, cassette 7 16 14 44 37 29 4 24 40 *RIAA: Platinum *MC: Platinum *RMNZ: Gold ==Extended plays== List of extended plays with selected details Title EP details The Singles * Released: January, 1992 * Label: Virgin (#VJCP 14038) * Formats: CD (Japan exclusive) ==Singles== List of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions and certifications, showing year released and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US AUS Australian (ARIA) singles chart peaks: *Top 50 peaks: *\"Forever Your Girl\" and \"Knocked Out\" (1989 release): *\"Cold Hearted\": N.B.
