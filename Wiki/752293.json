 "text": "The European polecat (Mustela putorius) is a species of mustelid native to western Eurasia and north Morocco. It is also known as the common polecat, black or forest polecat, European ferret, wild ferret, foumart, fitch, or simply polecat. It is dark brown, with a pale underbelly and a dark mask across the face. Occasionally, there are other color variations, such as albinos. The family it is in also contains minks and other weasels. Compared to them, the polecat has a shorter, more compact body; a more powerfully built skull and teeth; and is less agile. It is well known for its ability to secrete a particularly foul-smelling liquid to mark its territory. It is much less territorial than other mustelid. Animals of the same sex frequently share home ranges. Like other mustelids, the European polecat is polygamous, with pregnancy occurring after mating, with no induced ovulation. It usually gives birth in early summer to litters consisting of five to ten kits, which become independent at the age of two to three months. The European polecat feeds on small rodents, birds, amphibians and reptiles. It occasionally cripples its prey by piercing its brain with its teeth and stores it, still living, in its burrow for future consumption. The European polecat originated in Western Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. its closest living relatives are the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret and the European mink. It can produce fertile offspring with the steppe polecat and the black-footed ferret.Davison, A., et al. (1999) Hybridization and the phylogenetic relationship between polecats and domestic ferrets in Britain , Biological Conservation 87 :155-161 Hybrids of polecat and mink tend to be sterile, and are distinguished from their parent species by their larger size and more valuable pelts. The European polecat is the only ancestor of the ferret, which was domesticated more than 2000 years ago for hunting vermin. The species has otherwise been historically viewed negatively by humans. In the British Isles especially, the polecat was persecuted by gamekeepers, and became synonymous with promiscuity in early English literature. During modern times, the polecat is still scantly represented in popular culture when compared to other rare British mammals, and misunderstandings of its behaviour still persist in some rural areas. , it is classed by the IUCN as Least Concern due to its wide range and large numbers. == Local names == === Dialectal English names === Indigenous names for Mustela putorius Linguistic group or area Dialectal name Anglo-Manx Foul- cat Craven/Leeds/South Lancashire Pow-cat Durham Foomart Herefordshire Fitchuck Lancashire FoomurtCobham, Alan (n.d.)
