 "text": "A linga or a lingam is a revered symbol in Hinduism, embodies the essence of formless Shiva. As described in ancient scriptures and texts, the Linga represents an abstract manifestation of Shiva's infinite consciousness and cosmic energy. Its cylindrical shape signifies the boundless and eternal nature of the divine, transcending physical form. Within the sanctum sanctorum of temples and in worship rituals, devotees venerate the Linga as a symbol of the unmanifest aspect of Shiva, recognizing it as a focal point for spiritual reverence and connection to the formless essence of the divine. Thus, the Shiva Linga serves as a potent reminder of the omnipresent and timeless presence of Shiva, beyond the confines of physical attributes or limitations. https://www.shankaracharya.org/shiva_manasa_pooja.php https://sairhythms.sathyasai.org/song/shivaya-namah-shiva-lingaya-namah It is associated with Shiva, supreme god in main gods of the Hindus.
