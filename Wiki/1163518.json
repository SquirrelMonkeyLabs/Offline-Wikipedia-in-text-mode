 "text": "The Evansville Triplets were a Minor League Baseball team from Evansville, Indiana, that played from 1970 to 1984. They played baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball (MLB), against other baseball teams in the American Association. Their home stadium was called Bosse Field. The Triplets were partnered with three MLB teams: the Minnesota Twins (1970), Milwaukee Brewers (1971–1973), and Detroit Tigers (1974–1984). Evansville won the American Association championship in 1972 as the Triple-A partner of the Milwaukee Brewers. They won two more championships with the Detroit Tigers (1975 and 1979). The 1975 team also won the Junior World Series, a competition against the champions of the International League, the Tidewater Tides. In 1984, the Triplets were sold to Larry Schmittou and other owners of the Nashville Sounds, a Double-A team of the Southern League, for a reported sum of US$780,000. They moved the team to Nashville, Tennessee, for the 1985 season. Schmittou planned to move the Double-A Southern League team to Evansville. However, the league did not like the idea, and the City of Evansville did not want to upgrade Bosse Field. == References == == Other websites == * Statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:Baseball teams in the United States",
