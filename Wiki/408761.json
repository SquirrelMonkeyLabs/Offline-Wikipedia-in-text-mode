 "text": "::This is a list of compositions by Frédéric Chopin by genre. There is a separate list by opus number. Most of Frédéric Chopin's compositions were for solo piano. He also composed piano concertos (his concertos No. 1 and No. 2 are two of the romantic piano concerto repertoire's most often-performed pieces) as well as some other music for ensembles. This listing uses the traditional opus numbers where they apply; other works are listed by number from the catalogues of Maurice J. E. Brown (B), Krystyna Kobylańska (KK), and Józef Michał Chomiński (A, C, D, E, P, S). == Piano solo == === Ballades === * Op. 23: Ballade No. 1 in G minor (composed 1835-36) * Op. 38: Ballade No. 2 in F major (1836–39) * Op. 47: Ballade No. 3 in A-flat major (1841) * Op. 52: Ballade No. 4 in F minor (1842–43) === Études === Fanciful nicknames have been given to most of Chopin's Études from time to time, although Chopin himself never used nicknames for these pieces, and none are authentic. Only about three such nicknames are widely used: Op. 10, No. 5 Black Keys; Op. 10, No. 12 Revolutionary; and Op. 25, No. 11 Winter Wind. A number of occasionally suggested nicknames are shown below. * Op. 10, 12 Études: ** No. 1: Étude in C major, Waterfall (composed 1830) ** No. 2: Étude in A minor, Chromatic (1830) ** No. 3: Étude in E major, Tristesse, or L'adieu (1832) ** No. 4: Étude in C-sharp minor, Torrent (1832) ** No. 5: Étude in G-flat major, Black Keys (1830) ** No. 6: Étude in E-flat minor (1830) ** No. 7: Étude in C major, Toccata (1832) ** No. 8: Étude in F major, Sunshine (1829) ** No. 9: Étude in F minor (1829) ** No. 10: Étude in A-flat major (1829) ** No. 11: Étude in E-flat major, Arpeggio (1829) ** No. 12: Étude in C minor, Revolutionary (1831) * Op. 25, 12 Études: ** No. 1: Étude in A-flat major, Aeolian Harp, or Shepherd Boy (composed 1836) ** No. 2: Étude in F minor, The Bees (1836) ** No. 3: Étude in F major, The Horseman (1836) ** No. 4: Étude in A minor (1832–1834) ** No. 5: Étude in E minor, Wrong Note (1832–1834) ** No. 6: Étude in G-sharp minor, Double Third (1832–1834) ** No. 7: Étude in C-sharp minor, Cello (1836) ** No. 8: Étude in D-flat major, Sixths (1832–1834) ** No. 9: Étude in G-flat major, Butterfly (1832–1834) ** No. 10: Étude in B minor, Octave (1832–1834) ** No. 11: Étude in A minor, Winter Wind (1834) ** No. 12: Étude in C minor, Ocean (1836) * Trois nouvelles études (1839): ** No. 1: Étude in F minor ** No. 2: Étude in A-flat major ** No. 3: Étude in D-flat major === Impromptus === * Op. 29: Impromptu No. 1 in A-flat major (1837) * Op. 36: Impromptu No. 2 in F-sharp major (1839) * Op. 51: Impromptu No. 3 in G-flat major (1843) ==== Posthumously published ==== * Op. posth. 66: Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor (1834) === Mazurkas === * Two Mazurkas (unnumbered; 1826; pub. 1826, without Op. number; B. 16, KK IIa/2-3, S 1, No. 2): ** a.
