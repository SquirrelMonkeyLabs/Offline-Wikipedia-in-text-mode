 "text": "Bass instrument amplification is an amplifier used for bass guitars, double bass and similar instruments. It makes the sound they make louder. It is different from other types of amplification systems because it is difficult to reproduce low-frequency sounds (bass). Bass amps need strong loudspeakers, and a relatively larger speaker cabinet. Speaker cabinets for bass instrument amplification usually have larger (or more) loudspeakers than those used for the amplification of other instruments. The loudspeakers themselves must also be sturdier to handle the higher power levels. Category:Electronic musical instruments Category:Music technology",
