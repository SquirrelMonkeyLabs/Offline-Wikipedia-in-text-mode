 "text": "We pass through many problems in our life life some are financial, physical, mental or many more ..But they all have the same procedure to solve .SO, what is a problem ?it is nothing but an obstacle which avoids us to go through a straight line. Let us take a situation, you are walking on a straight route towards your destination but there is a rock in between ..What would you do?.. So here the rock is an obstacle so you start with a thinking how would you get rid of this ..This thinking is called as problem solving and the rock is called as the problem .so now you think how this is related to your stream in computer science.?.. Well! this is a quiet good question ..you see many apps like what s app, mails ,twitter , face book, are all these kinds of stuffs which you use do you know how these are made? through programming languages .. So since the computer only understands its own language.. So we humans need to know this language in order to solve our problems .So,for the system the problem solving can done in two different ways . 1\\. Algorithmic Approach- it is a step by step process to solve a particular problem .for example if you want to make tea then you have follow a step by step procedure : first add water then add the tea leaves then add some milk and sugar then there you have it ..so this is an algorithmic approach. 2.Experimental Approach- this is also called as an IDEAL approach let me explain.. I-identify D-define E-explore A-action and L- lookback this goes on a loop. the steps involved to write a programming languages are: defining and analising writing codes compilation and execution - the compilation process converts the source code written using a programming languages debugging and testing documentation",
