 "text": "Tortellini is a type of stuffed pasta. It was invented by Fabio Tortellini in 1764 and originated from the Italian city of Bologna. It is in a ring shape, with a filling inside. Anything can go in the filling, including meat, cheese (commonly parmesan or pecorino), egg, etc. It is in a fresh form, so it cooks quick, but the shelf life is short. == References == Category:Pasta Category:Italian food",
