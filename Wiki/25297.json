 "text": "The Renaissance is a period in European history that followed the Middle Ages and ended in the 17th century. Renaissance is a French word for “cultural rebirth.” During this period, there was a “rebirth” of classical learning. People started relearning the teachings of scholars from Ancient Greece, Rome, and other ancient societies. The Renaissance is often said to be the start of the modern age. During the Renaissance, there were many advances in art, literature, the sciences, mathematics, and culture. Many famous artists, writers, philosophers, and scientists lived during this period. A person who is clever at a great number of things is sometimes called a \"Renaissance man.\" The most famous Renaissance man was Leonardo da Vinci, a painter, scientist, musician, and philosopher. The Renaissance started in Italy but soon spread throughout Europe. In Italy, the period is divided into three parts: * the Early Renaissance * the High Renaissance * the Late Renaissance (also called the \"Mannerist period\") Following the Mannerist period was the Baroque period, which also spread across Europe starting around 1600. Outside Italy, it can be hard to tell when the Renaissance period ended and the Baroque began. == Causes == === Reading and printing === In the Middle Ages, most artistic, legal, and historical production took place in and around books. Monasteries, churches, universities, and rich people them produced and owned books. They were produced entirely by hand and so were called manuscripts; illuminated manuscripts include handcolored, drawn, and gilded pictures. Most books were written in Greek or Latin, which was used in the Catholic Church. Only priests and well-educated people could read Latin. People were forbidden by church law from translating the Bible into Italian, English, German, French, or other local languages. Around 1440, the first printed books were made in Europe. The printing press made it possible to print copies of large books like the Bible and to sell them cheaply. It took 300 calf skins or 100 pig skins to print the Bible. Printers soon began to print everything that they thought was interesting: Ancient Greek and Roman writings, poetry, and plays; stories about the lives of the saints; mathematics textbooks; medical textbooks; Christian stories; erotic stories; books about animals and monsters; maps of the world; and advice to princes about on to rule. Before the invention of the printing press, knowledge had belonged to priests, monasteries, and universities. Suddenly many thousands of people, even merchants, could learn far more than they ever could before. === Ancient Roman things === From about 400 BC to 400 AD, Europe experienced a Golden Age. In Ancient Greece and Rome, there were many philosophers, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and mathematicians. Things were beautiful, well-organized, and well run. However, by the year 1400, the city of Rome was in ruins. Inside the broken walls, which had been smashed in 410 AD, were the remains of huge temples, sports arenas, public baths, apartment blocks and palaces. Nearly all of them were half-buried and ruined and so they could not be used. Many were pulled down to use as building stone. Among the ruins of the once-great city, the people of Rome lived in cottages. They still went to church in the huge churches (basilicas) that had been built by the first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great, in the 4th century. They still held market day in the ancient Roman market place of Campo dei Fiori (\"Field of Flowers\"). In 1402, Filippo Brunelleschi and the teenager Donatello came to Rome. They were probably the world's first archaeologists. They were fascinated by everything that they saw. They measured ancient ruined buildings, drew things, and dug around for weeks looking for bits of broken statues and painted pottery that they could put back together. When they went back home to Florence, they knew more about ancient Roman architecture and sculpture than anyone had known for about a thousand years. Brunelleschi became a very famous architect, and Donatello became a very famous sculptor. === Money and politics === The Renaissance really began in the city of Florence. In those days, Italy was not one single country but was made of many little states. All of them were governed in different ways and were constantly making alliances and fighting one other. Rome was politically powerfu, because the city had the Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Because of his very great importance as a spiritual leader, most people and most cities did not want to argue with him. After a pope died, a new pope was elected. Rich and powerful people hoped that a member of their family would be chosen. It was always a good idea to have several young men in the family trained as priests just in case. It also helped to be good friends with other rich families. One way to do so was to have many daughters and to get them to marry rich and powerful men from different cities, which was how politics then worked. There were other powerful cities in Italy. Venice had a large and powerful navy. Milan controlled trade with Northern Europe and was very rich. Genoa was also very rich because it controlled trade with France and Spain. Florence, where the Renaissance is said to have started, was another important city. Florence’s strength came from a strong army, strong fortress, or control over trade but came from banking. The ruling Medicis were an important banking family and helped to make Florence a powerful city and the centre of Renaissance learning. == List of important events of the Renaissance == === In art === * 1401: Lorenzo Ghiberti wins a competition to create the Florence Baptistry Doors.
