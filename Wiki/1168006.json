 "text": "Sarit Sarak () or Sharit Sharak () is a classical Meitei traditional martial art form. It is originated from the Ancient Kangleipak (present day Manipur state). It is practised without using any weaponry. It is also defined as \"hand to hand combat.\" It is considered as the sibling of Thang Ta, which uses weapons. Sarit-Sarak is a form of unarmed combat that includes techniques like Khutlon (hand and arm movements) and Khonglon (foot and leg movements). These techniques help improve strength, agility, and self-defense skills without using weapons. It is a unique style of unarmed combat that stands out from other martial arts. It is perfect in both avoiding attacks and launching its own, making it superior to other martial arts in the same category. In ancient times, Sarit-Sarak was an important part of Meitei society, helping warriors stay strong and ready, even without weapons. It taught important skills like offense, self-defense, and planning. Sharing the lessons from Sarit-Sarak with the current generation keep these traditions alive and improve physical and mental strength. == Word origin == The term \"Sarit-Sarak\" is derived from two Meitei language words: \"Sha-lit\" and \"Sha-lak.\" \"Sha-lit\" refers to escaping from an animal, while \"Sha-lak\" means taming the animal. The combination of these words reflects the system’s focus on both evading attacks and controlling or neutralizing threats, similar to how one would escape from or tame a wild animal. == Associations and organizations == === National level in New Delhi === The Sarit-Sarak Federation of India, in collaboration with the Sarit-Sarak Association of New Delhi, organized the First National Sarit-Sarak Championship at the Akhil Bharat Hindu Maha Sabha Auditorium in 2024.
