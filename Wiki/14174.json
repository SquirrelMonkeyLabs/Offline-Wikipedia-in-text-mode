 "text": "Titanium is a very strong metal that is used in special applications. The most common isotope has 26 neutrons. Titanium was discovered in 1791 by William Gregor. It is chemical element number 22 on the periodic table. Its symbol is Ti. It has 22 electrons and 22 protons. Its name comes from the name of the strong Greek gods called Titans. Titanium can combine with other chemicals to make different materials. When titanium mixes with oxygen from the air, it forms titanium dioxide (TiO2) or titania, which forms a hard passivation layer around the metal that prevents corrosion. Titanium dioxide is a white pigment that is often used to make things less transparent, brighter, or rougher - because it does not react with chemicals inside the human body, it is safe to use in foods and other applications, like toothpaste. Titanium alloys are used in aerospace engineering to make very strong and light parts of aeroplanes. These alloys can replace steel because they are almost as strong as steel but much lighter. They are also much stronger than aluminium alloys, but only a little heavier, meaning that titanium parts can be thinner and lighter, while still withstanding the same forces. It does not corrode in most conditions, even when exposed to sea water or chlorine. However, it can burn at high temperatures, and like many metal powders, titanium dust is extremely flammable. More than a third of the world's titanium in 2021 was produced by a Russian firm, VSMPO-AVISMA, which has factories in many countries including one in Redditch, England. == References == Category:Titanium",
