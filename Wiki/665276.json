 "text": "Kivitoo was an Inuit community. It was also a whaling station. It was on the northeast shore of Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. The Inuit families that lived in Kivitoo moved to Qikiqtarjuaq in the 1950s. Qikiqtarjuaq is south of Kivitoo. ==History== In the 20th century, the Sabellum Trading Company created a whaling post at Kivitoo. This was to help the whalers that would stop there. The post was abandoned in 1926. Kivitoo was a Distant Early Warning Line site. It's code was FOX-D. Right now, it is a North Warning System site. A short airstrip was built near Kivitoo around the time it became a Distant Early Warning Line site. The people that were living in Kivitoo were moved to Qikiqtarjuaq in the 1950s by the Canadian government. This was supposed to be for their safety because three people that lived in Kivitoo were killed when ice broke under their igloos. The people never came back to Kivitoo. The government had already demolished most of the buildings in Kivitoo. A documentary that was made by Zacharias Kunuk talked about Kivitoo. It is called Kivitoo: What They Thought of Us. ==References== ==Other websites== * Photos of Kivitoo in 2008 Category:Nunavut Category:Ghost towns in Canada",
