In 1948 he was awarded the USSR State Prize for the Motherland cantata, a graduation piece he wrote as a student at the Moscow Conservatory. He has continued to win acclaim at home and abroad for his works, many of which are quickened by the folk traditions of Armenian music. Some of Arutiunian's works for wind instruments, notably the 1950 concerto for trumpet, the concerto for tuba, and the brass quintet Armenian Scenes, have secured their place in the international repertory, having been performed by conductors such as Valeri Gergiev, who has recorded his Symphony for large orchestra, composed in 1957 with the Symphony orchestra of the Russian All- Union Radio. In 1988, he composed his Violin Concerto \"Armenia-88\". == Filmography == === Music for Films === * Nahapet (1977) (as Life Triumphs in USA) * Za chas do rassveta (An Hour Before the Dawn, 1973, TV) * Sirtn e yergum (The Heart Sings, 1957) * Urvakannere heranum en lernerits (Ghosts Leave the Peaks, 1955) * Aleph, lectures contades (2000) Italian TV episode (soundtrack: \"Concerto for trombone and orchestra\") === As Actor === * Lalvari vorskane (Lalvar Hunter, 1967) as Zako == Other websites == * www.alexanderarutiunian.com * List of works * Arutiunian's 85th Birthday Concert in Yerevan * Arutunian at IMDB == References == Category:1920 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Armenian composers Category:People from Yerevan Category:20th-century composers Category:21st-century composers Category:Pianists Category:20th-century Armenian people",
