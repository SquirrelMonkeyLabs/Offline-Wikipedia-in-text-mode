 "text": "In polymer chemistry, a cross-link is a chemical bond or small group of bonds that connects two bigger polymer molecules. Making cross-links is called cross-linking or curing, and is an important part of making many different materials. A chemical that creates cross-links in a polymer is called a cross- linking agent. If sulfur is used as the cross-linking agent, the process is sometimes called vulcanization. Oxygen from the air can also be a cross- linking agent; chemicals that are cross-linked by oxygen are called drying oils. The amount of cross-links in a sample can change properties like strength, density, and flexibility. The amount of cross-links is also linked to the swelling capacity, which is used to measure how cross-linked something is. == Sources == Category:Polymer chemistry",
