 "text": "The Toyota Prius is a hybrid vehicle from the Japanese automobile producer Toyota. It is called 'hybrid' because it has two different engines: a gasoline engine (combustion engine) and an electric motor. Because of the electric motor, it uses less fuel than a normal gasoline automobile when driving at low speeds (for example in the city). The electric motor uses batteries for its power, and these batteries are charged by a dynamo when the gasoline engine is used at higher speeds. == First generation (XW10) == File:Toyota PRIUS (NHW10) front.JPG|Toyota Prius NHW10 File:Toyota PRIUS (NHW10) rear.JPG == Second generation (XW20) == File:Toyota Prius NHW20.jpg|Toyota Prius NHW20 File:Toyota Prius NHW20 rear.jpg File:2007 Toyota Prius interior.jpg|Interior == Third generation (XW30) == File:Toyota Prius -- 07-14-2011.jpg|Toyota Prius XW30 File:2010 Toyota Prius rear.JPG File:2012 Toyota Prius -- 07-08-2012 1.jpg|Facelift File:2012 Toyota Prius (ZVW30R MY12) i-Tech liftback (2012-10-26) 02 (cropped).jpg File:2009 Toyota Prius 03.jpg == Fourth generation (XW50) == File:2016 Toyota Prius (ZVW50L) Hybrid liftback (2016-04-02) 01.jpg|Toyota Prius XW50 File:2016 Toyota Prius (ZVW50L) Hybrid liftback (2016-04-02) 02.jpg File:2019 Toyota Prius AWD-e in Super White, Front Left.jpg|Facelift File:2019 Toyota Prius AWD-e in Super White, Rear Right.jpg File:Prius4 Dashboard IMG 6871.JPG == Fifth generation (XW60) == File:Toyota Prius (XW60) Plug-in Hybrid Automesse Ludwigsburg 2023 1X7A0004.jpg|Toyota Prius XW60 File:Toyota Prius (XW60) Plug-in Hybrid Automesse Ludwigsburg 2023 1X7A0006.jpg File:2023 Toyota Prius Z 2.0L HEV (2).jpg == References == Category:1990s automobiles Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles Category:2020s automobiles Prius",
