Selsey is at the southernmost point of the Manhood Peninsula, almost cut off from mainland Sussex by the sea. It is bounded to the west by Bracklesham Bay, to the north by Broad Rife (rifeParish. A Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect. pp. 96-97 being the local word for stream or creek), to the east by Pagham Harbour and ends in the south at Selsey Bill. There are significant rock formations beneath the sea off both of its coasts, named the Owers rocks and Mixon rocks. Coastal erosion has been an ever-present problem for Selsey.SCOPAC.
