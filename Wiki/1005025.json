 "text": "Sancerre is a medieval hilltop town and commune in the Cher department, France overlooking the river Loire. It is noted for its wine. It is a natural fortress 312 meters in height. The Counts of Champagne built fortifications there in the 12th century. During the French Wars of Religion the Huguenot people were besieged there for 8 months in 1572/3. About 500 people died, mostly of starvation. The siege of Sancerre was written about by a Protestant minister Jean de LÃ©ry, who survived the battle, in The Memorable History of the Siege of Sancerre (1574). A mansion was built on the ruins of the original Chateau de Sancerre in 1874. In 2008 there were 1697 people living there. == References == Category:Communes in Cher",
