In the book, Luther claimed there is a \"Jewish conspiracy against Christianity\". Some influencers still promote these views. In his book, Luther classified Jews as the biggest threat to Christianity and called for these actions against them:\"Luther, Martin\", JewishEncyclopedia.com; cf. Luther's Works, American Edition, 55 vols., (St. Louis and Philadelphia: Concordia Publishing House and Fortress Press, 1955–86) 47:267. > First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools [...] This is to be done > in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are > Christians [...] Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and > destroyed. [...] Sixth, I advise that [...] all cash and treasure of silver > and gold be taken from them [...] But if we are afraid that they might harm > us [...] then let us emulate the common sense of other nations such as > France, Spain, Bohemia [and] eject them forever from the country. In his sermon Warning against the Jews on February 18, 1546, Luther said:Martin Brecht, Martin Luther, 3 vols. (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 3:371. Later, in the 20th century, Luther became a folk hero in Nazi Germany.Richard Steigmann-Gall, The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.138. Nazi teachings which glorified Luther and repeated his antisemitic beliefs were widely circulated among the public. Statues of Luther were built across Nazi Germany. In 1933, Adolf Hitler made \"German Luther Day\" a national holiday, and it was celebrated regularly. Johannes Wallman (1930–2021), a professor of church history at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, wrote in 1987: Richard Steigmann-Gall, a history professor at Kent State University, wrote in his 2003 book The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945: ===Nazi Germany=== In Nazi Germany (1933‒45), \"criticism\" of Judaism was a major theme in state propaganda. Nazi intellectuals, under the pretence of academic study, made detailed attacks on Judaism in the newspaper Der Stürmer (1923‒45) based on distortions of the Talmud. Top Nazi racial theorist Alfred Rosenberg justified intellectual attacks on Judaism: Rosenberg and other Nazis saw the Jewish emphasis on following the commandments for small details in life as a sign of \"lack of moral understanding\". They accused Jews of using \"double moral standards\" in their dealings with gentiles. Some Nazis were experts on Judaism themselves, which made their attacks on the religion more convincing to the public. ===James Edwards=== On February 20, 2007, American radio host James Edwards accused Jews of \"hating Christianity\" and \"using pornography as a subversive tool against us\". ===Radical traditionalist Catholics=== A minority of conservative Catholics, commonly called the radical traditionalist Catholics, * * * * share Luther's antisemitic views even though they disagree with him over theology. According to American civil rights group Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), radical traditionalist Catholics tend to hold these views: * Catholics cannot trust Jews * Jews are the \"perpetual enemy\" of Christ * Jews have \"infiltrated\" the Catholic Church to make changes for themselves * Jews are responsible for Jesus' death, and this broke their covenant with God Radical traditionalist Catholics do not get along with the Vatican because they oppose the 1965 Vatican II reforms. As part of these reforms, Pope Paul VI said that the Jews were not responsible for Jesus's death: * * * ==Public views== ===Anti-Defamation League=== Regarding the matter, American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) noted: The ADL also criticized antisemites – including David Duke, Elizabeth Dilling and Michael A. Hoffman II – for quoting passages from the Talmud and Midrash out of context, judging them by recent moral standards and ignoring the fact that they were written two thousand years ago by those in different cultures. ===Rabbi Rowe=== Rabbi Rowe, the former executive of Aish UK, said the Talmud was \"the most natural target for antisemitism\", which has been \"going on for centuries\". The Talmud has been targeted because the Torah is the Old Testament of Christianity. Because of the Talmud's secret nature, it is harder for laymen to know enough about it to refute false claims made by antisemites. Rabbi Rowe noted that antisemitism was always about demonization ‒ making Jews look hateful and demonic ‒ to justify emotional hatred of Jews. In addition, Rabbi Rowe cautioned that what used to be only Neo-Nazi propaganda was going mainstream due to social media influencers like the Armenian-American businessman Dan Bilzerian. Bilzerian has millions of followers on Twitter from across the political spectrum. He has been exploiting the recent war in Gaza to link Israel with their twisted view of Judaism in order to prevent the ignorant from sympathizing with the Jews. ==False claims about Judaism== Below are some (but not all) false claims made by antisemites about Judaism. Aspect Summary Gentile humanhood Myth 1: \"Judaism says non-Jews are subhumans.\" Fact: Mainstream Judaism has never seen non-Jews as subhumans.Mishnah (Avoth 3:14) and Talmud (Avoth 9b): [רבי עקיבא] היה אומר: חביב אדם שנברא בצלם. חיבה יתרה נודעת לו שנברא בצלם, שנאמר (בראשית ט:ו), \"כי בצלם אלקים עשה את האדם.\" [Rabbi Akiva] used to say, “Beloved is man, for he was created in God’s image; and the fact that God made it known that man was created in His image is indicative of an even greater love. As the verse states (Genesis 9:6), ‘In the image of God, man was created.’)” It believes that everyone is equal, because everyone is created by God in His image. Treatment of gentiles Myth 2: \"Jewish law allows Jews to kill non-Jews.\" Fact: Antisemites cite a line allegedly from the 2nd-century Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai. However, the line refers only to the situation of war. Simeon lived at a time when Jews were forced to fight non-Jews, especially in the Bar Kochba revolt, due to persecution by Roman Emperor Hadrian. Child sex abuse Myth 3: \"Judaism allows sexual abuse of young girls.\" Fact: This claim was made by Russian Catholic Reverend I.B. Pranaitis. He distorted Talmud writings to demonize Jews. The Talmud actually treats child sex abuse as rape.\"פיתוי קטנה אונס נינהו.\" One who seduces an underage girl is considered as if he had raped her [i.e., the laws applicable to rapists would apply to the molester]. The distorted writings came from a chapter in the Ketubot discussing victims of child sex abuse. The chapter actually stated that a girl who was sexually abused before age three should be seen as a virgin and deserving of higher status. Study of Torah Myth 4: \"Non-Jews studying the Torah are worthy of death.\"J. David Bleich, Contemporary Halakhic Problems vol. 2 (New York: Ktav, 1983), pp. 311-340. Fact: This claim was made by David Duke, the former KKK leader and a Holocaust denier. He cherrypicked a single line from a whole passage. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yohanan said that the misquoted passage did not refer to Jews but the generic \"Man\", who is supposed to be studying the Torah as a believer rather than making it a subject of study without spiritual commitment, which would be a form of blasphemy. Non-Jews studying the Torah are respected if they are studying it as a matter of faith. Honesty Myth 5: \"According to Libbre David 37, a Jew must give non-Jews a false explanation about the Talmud, or the Jew will be put to death.\" Fact: Libbre David 37 does not exist. It was made up by Neo-Nazis who run several disinformation websites. Gentile acts towards Jews Myth 6: \"If a Goy hits a Jew, he must be killed.\" Fact: This claim is based on the distortion of Sanhedrib 58b. It does not incite Jews to kill non-Jews. It actually discusses options for dealing with non-Jewish attacks on Jews. Socialization Myth 7: \"Tosfot Yevamot 84b says that a Jew eating with a Goy is the same as eating with a dog.\" Fact: This is a falsification. Lost items Myth 8: \"Bava Matzia 24a says that a Jew does not need to return an item lost by a Goy.\" Fact: This claim is based on the distortion of Bava Matzia 24a, which discusses options for dealing with items found lost after a flood or a wild animal encounter. ==Related pages== * Jewish deicide * Antisemitism in Europe * Anti-Judaism and antisemitism ==References== Category:Racism Category:Catholicism Category:Lutheranism Category:Disinformation Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:History of Christianity",
