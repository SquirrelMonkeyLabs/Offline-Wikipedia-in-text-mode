 "text": "The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the leader of His Majesty's Government. They chair Cabinet meetings. It is the highest civil office in the United Kingdom. The present prime minister has been Keir Starmer since 5 July 2024. == The procedure == The appointment of a prime minister by the monarch is based on advice. However, though the advice is technically informal, the monarch would create a constitutional crisis if they did not comply. Therefore, in practice, what is decided in the House of Commons is the decisive event. The voters elect Members of Parliament (MPs), and the MPs choose the prime minister. The system grew in stages as the Commons grew in power and the monarch's authority dwindled. == List of prime ministers == Name Time in office Political party Keir Starmer 2024 - present Labour Rishi Sunak 2022 – 2024 Conservative Liz Truss 2022 Conservative Boris Johnson 2019 – 2022 Conservative Theresa May 2016 – 2019 Conservative David Cameron 2010 – 2016 Conservative Gordon Brown 2007 – 2010 Labour Tony Blair 1997 – 2007 Labour John Major 1990 – 1997 Conservative Margaret Thatcher 1979 – 1990 Conservative James Callaghan 1976 – 1979 Labour Harold Wilson 1974 – 1976 Labour Edward Heath 1970 – 1974 Conservative Harold Wilson 1964 – 1970 Labour Alec Douglas- Home 1963 – 1964 Conservative Harold Macmillan 1957 – 1963 Conservative Anthony Eden 1955 – 1957 Conservative Winston Churchill 1951 – 1955 Conservative Clement Attlee 1945 – 1951 Labour Winston Churchill 1940 – 1945 Conservative Neville Chamberlain 1937 – 1940 Conservative Stanley Baldwin 1935 – 1937 Conservative Ramsay MacDonald 1929 – 1935 Labour Stanley Baldwin 1924 – 1929 Conservative Ramsay MacDonald 1924 Labour Stanley Baldwin 1923 – 1924 Conservative Andrew Bonar Law 1922 – 1923 Conservative David Lloyd George 1916 – 1922 Liberal Herbert Asquith 1908 – 1916 Liberal Henry Campbell-Bannerman 1905 – 1908 Liberal Arthur Balfour 1902 – 1905 Conservative Marquess of Salisbury 1895 – 1902 Conservative Earl of Rosebery 1894 – 1895 Liberal William Ewart Gladstone 1892 – 1894 Liberal Marquess of Salisbury 1886 – 1892 Conservative William Ewart Gladstone 1886 – 1886 Liberal Marquess of Salisbury 1885 – 1886 Conservative William Ewart Gladstone 1880 – 1885 Liberal Benjamin Disraeli 1874 – 1880 Conservative William Ewart Gladstone 1868 – 1874 Liberal Benjamin Disraeli 1868 – 1868 Conservative The Earl of Derby 1866 – 1868 Conservative Lord John Russell 1865 – 1866 Whig Viscount Palmerston 1859 – 1865 Whig The Earl of Derby 1858 – 1859 Conservative Viscount Palmerston 1855 – 1858 Whig Earl of Aberdeen 1852 – 1855 Conservative The Earl of Derby 1852 Conservative Lord John Russell 1846 – 1852 Whig Sir Robert Peel 1841 – 1846 Conservative Viscount Melbourne 1835 – 1841 Whig Sir Robert Peel 1834 – 1835 Conservative Duke of Wellington 1834 Tory Viscount Melbourne 1834 Whig Earl Grey 1830 – 1834 Whig Duke of Wellington 1828 – 1830 Tory Viscount Goderich 1827 – 1828 Tory George Canning 1827 – 1827 Tory Earl of Liverpool 1812 – 1827 Tory Spencer Perceval 1809 – 1812 Tory Duke of Portland 1807 – 1809 Whig William Grenville 1806 – 1807 Whig William Pitt the Younger 1804 – 1806 Tory Henry Addington 1801 – 1804 Tory William Pitt the Younger 1783 – 1801 Tory Duke of Portland 1783 Whig Earl of Shelburne 1782 – 1783 Whig Marquess of Rockingham 1782 Whig Lord North 1770 – 1782 Tory Duke of Grafton 1768 – 1770 Whig William Pitt 1766 – 1768 Whig Marquess of Rockingham 1765 – 1766 Whig George Grenville 1763 – 1765 Whig Earl of Bute 1762 – 1763 Tory Duke of Newcastle 1757 – 1762 Whig Duke of Devonshire 1756 – 1757 Whig Duke of Newcastle 1754 – 1756 Whig Henry Pelham 1743 – 1754 Whig Spencer Compton 1742 – 1743 Whig Robert Walpole 1721 – 1742 Whig == References == * United Kingdom",
