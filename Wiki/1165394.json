 "text": "Laser cooling is a technique used to make atoms extremely cold by using laser light. It works by shining lasers at atoms in a way that slows them down, reducing their motion and lowering their temperature. This is possible because light can push on atoms, and by carefully tuning the laser's frequency, scientists can make the atoms lose energy and cool down. This method is used in experiments that require ultra-cold temperatures, such as quantum physics and atomic clocks. Category:Physics",
