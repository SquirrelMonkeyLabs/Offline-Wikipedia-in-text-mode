 "text": "The term \"Deep South\" refers to the lower states in the Southern United States. It is also part of the \"Bible Belt\". The core states of the Deep South are Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia. North Florida, East Texas and South Tennessee are often included as part of the \"Deep South\". These areas relied heavily on plantation farming with slaves in the pre-Civil War era. These states are racially diverse, where African Americans and White Americans form a majority or plurality in many areas. These states are generally socially conservative. Politically they are labelled as \"Red States\", because the people largely vote for the Republican Party, which is socially conservative and right-wing.
