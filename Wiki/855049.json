 "text": "Markook bread (), also known as khubz ruqaq (), shrak (), khubz rqeeq (), mashrooh (), and saj bread (), is a Middle Eastern type of unleavened flatbread. It is commonly eaten in the Levant and in Lebanon. It is baked on a convex metal griddle (a saj) or in a tannour. Markook shrek is a type of thin bread. The dough is unleavened and usually made with only flour, water, and salt. After it is rested, it is divided into round portions, flattened and spread across a round cushion until it is thin then flipped onto the saj. It is often folded in bags before it is sold. It is commonly compared to another Middle Eastern bread known as pita, although it is much larger and thinner. In some Arab countries, such as Lebanon, different names are given for the same flatbread, such as khamir, maluj and ṣaluf, depending on the regional dialects. ==Etymology== Markook مرقوق comes from the Arabic word raqiq رقيق meaning delicate, and raqiq رقيق also comes from the Verb Raq رق. == Related pages == * Gözleme * Naan * Pita ==References== Category:Lebanese food Category:Palestinian food Category:Syrian food Category:Middle Eastern foods Category:Jordanian food Category:Iraqi food Category:Israeli food Category:Saudi Arabian food Category:Flatbreads",
