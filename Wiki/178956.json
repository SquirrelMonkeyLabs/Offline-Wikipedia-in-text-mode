 "text": "A dodecahedron is a polyhedron (a three-dimensional shape) that has 12 faces. Each face is a pentagon (a polygon with five edges). It has 20 corners (also called vertices) and 30 edges altogether. A regular dodecahedron, which looks exactly the same from all faces, is a Platonic solid. The dual of a dodecahedron is an icosahedron. ==Surface area and volume== If a is the length of one of its edges, the surface area and volume of a regular dodecahedron are: :A = 3\\sqrt{25+10\\sqrt{5}} a^2 :V = \\frac{15+7\\sqrt{5}}{4} a^3 Category:Platonic solids",
