He was born on November 1, 1871 in Newark, New Jersey to Jonathan Townley Crane, a clergyman, and Mary Helen Peck Crane. He attended Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, but did not graduate. He moved to New York City in 1892 to write about the slum life of Manhattan. His major works include the novella Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893), the war novel The Red Badge of Courage (1895), and the short story \"The Open Boat\" (1897).
