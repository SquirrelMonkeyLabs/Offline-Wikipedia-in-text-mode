 "text": "\"You Don't Love Me Anymore\" is an original song by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. It was released for the album Off the Deep End in 1992. It is written as a soft ballad. It describes Yankovic and an unnamed girl's relationship. The couple were in love, but the girl has tried to kill Yankovic many times. She had done things like poison his coffee, leaving him for dead in a ditch, and putting a cobra in his underwear drawer. The humor in this song is the lyrics and the delivery. ==Formats and track listings== * Cassette single (Canada and United States) # \"You Don't Love Me Anymore\" – 4:00 # \"I Was Only Kidding\" – 3:31 * 12-inch single (Philippines) # \"You Don't Love Me Anymore\" – 4:00 # \"You Don't Love Me Anymore\" (dance mix) – 5:00 ==Charts== Chart (1992) Peak position Canadian Singles Chart (The Record) 26 ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Off the Deep End liner notes. * \"Weird Al\" Yankovic – vocals, keyboards, production, songwriting * Jim West – acoustic guitar * Tony Papa – engineering, mixing ==References== Category:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic songs Category:1992 songs",
