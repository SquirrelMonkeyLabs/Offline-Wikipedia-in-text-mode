The text was written by Johann Anton Mylius. It was discovered in 2005 in the Anna Amalia Library in Weimar. == History and background == Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar was born on 19 October 1662 (O.S.). He became co-ruler of Saxe-Weimar with his brother, Johan Ernst III in 1683. When Saxe-Weimar changed to using the Gregorian calendar, he chose 30 October to be his new birthday. In July 1708, Bach became the court organist at Weimar. Johann Samuel Drese and his son Johann Wilhelm were the court composers at the time. As an organist, Bach did not have to write music. Johann Anton Mylius was the superintendent of Buttst√§dt. He wrote an ode for Duke Wilhelm's birthday. It is based on the duke's motto. He asked Bach to write a melody for the ode. == Music == The aria is written for a soprano soloist, two violins, a viola, and basso continuo. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach Category:Arias",
