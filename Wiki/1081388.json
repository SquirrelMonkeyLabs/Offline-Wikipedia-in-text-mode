 "text": "Die Kunst der Fuge BWV 1080 is a musical work by Johann Sebastian Bach. The title translates to \"The Art of the Fugue\". It contains 14 fugues and four canons. Today, part of the work is lost. Bach wrote it during the last ten years of his life. He wanted to show what is possible to do using fugues. Like the Goldberg Variations, this is a work by Bach on one special subject. Bach didn't tell what instruments to use. Most works are for three or four instruments. Today, four different versions are known. They probably show an early version of the work. Each version has a different part of the work. The first prints are from 1751 and 1752. Bach died in 1750. ==References== Category:Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach",
