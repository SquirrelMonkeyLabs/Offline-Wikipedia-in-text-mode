Anne Frank's lyrical content is very dark. As it talks about killing, raping and mutilating her. The song is also sung by Jonas rather than Peter, because \"he [Peter] was so badly hung over he couldn't make it.\" == Track listing == == References == Category:1990 albums Category:Rock albums''' Category:Brainbombs songs",
