 "text": "A chopsticks landing is a way to catch and land a very big rocket. It was first done by SpaceX with their SpaceX Starship rocket in 2024. The name \"chopsticks\" comes from the two big arms that catch the rocket, which look a bit like chopsticks used for eating. == How it works == In a chopsticks landing, two big metal arms catch the rocket as it comes back to Earth. These arms are part of a tall tower. They move to grab the rocket and slow it down. This is different from how rockets used to land, which was often on their own legs or in the sea. The chopsticks can also lift the rocket and put it on the launch pad. This makes it easier to use the rocket again. == Alternate names == This method is also called the Mechazilla catch or the booster catching system. Some people call it the catching arms landing or mechanical arm recovery because the arms do the job of catching. Others may call it the tower catch landing or the Super Heavy catch system since it involves the tower catching the Super Heavy Booster. All these names describe the same idea of using arms to safely land the rocket without legs. == First chopsticks landing == SpaceX, a company that makes rockets, did the first chopsticks landing with their Starship rocket. This happened on October 13, 2024. It was a big step for space travel because it showed a new way to land very big rockets. == Why it matters == Chopsticks landings are important for a few reasons: * They can catch bigger rockets than before. * They make it easier to use rockets again. * They might make space travel cheaper. == References == Category:Rockets Category:SpaceX Category:Spaceflight",
