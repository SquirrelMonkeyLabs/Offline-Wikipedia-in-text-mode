Duane Nellis. ==Sports== The athletic teams of the university are called the Vandals. They have 16 varsity teams, almost all of which compete in the Big Sky Conference. The only exception is the women's swimming & diving team. Because the Big Sky does not sponsor that sport, that team competes in the Western Athletic Conference. ==Other websites== *University of Idaho's Official website Category:Big Sky Conference Category:Colleges and universities in Idaho Category:1889 establishments in the United States Category:1880s establishments in Idaho Territory",
