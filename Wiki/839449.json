The player controls Mario (or Luigi, found in an easter egg) to fight 34 other players. Defeating an enemy would cause it to go on someone else's screen. Most of them are defeated by stepping on them. If a player is the last Mario alive, then they win. == References == Category:2020 video games Category:Battle royale games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:Mario platform games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Nintendo Switch-only games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
