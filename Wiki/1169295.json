 "text": "The Manila Metro Rail Transit System (MRTS), commonly known as the MRT among Manilans, is a rapid transit system that primarily serves Metro Manila in the Philippines. Along with the Manila Light Rail Transit System and the Metro Commuter Line of the Philippine National Railways, the system makes up Metro Manila's rail transport infrastructure. The MRT serves an average daily ridership of 357,198, and an estimated annual ridership of 129,030,158 from a 2023 report. == Early planning == During the construction of the first line of the Manila Light Rail Transit System (LRT) in the early 1980s, Electrowatt Engineering Services of Zürich designed a comprehensive plan for a metro service in Metro Manila. The plan — still used as the basis for planning new metro lines — consisted of a network of rapid transit lines spanning all major corridors within 20 years. The study integrated two studies in the 1970s which recommended the construction of five heavy rail lines in Metro Manila, and another study in 1977 which was used as the basis for Manila's LRT Line 1. ==Network== There is currently one light rail metro line in operation and three heavy rail lines under construction. There are proposals to extend the system, with at least 49 stations across of track. Awaiting approvals are for MRT Lines 8, 10 and 11. A further proposal is for a circumferential–radial network for MRT Line 7. Line Termini Stations Type Length Ref.
