 "text": "Arizona Beverages USA (also known as AriZona) is an American company that sells iced tea and energy drinks. They are headquartered in Woodbury, New York. AriZona was first created by John Ferolito and Don Vultaggio of Brooklyn, New York on May 5, 1992. Santa Fe was first considered for the name of the drink but Vultaggio felt that the name did not look right on the can. The name Arizona was chosen because he felt that the state of Arizona had a more \"healthier and clean\" feeling compared his his hometown of Brooklyn. The drink was also launched to compete with fellow New York rival drink Snapple. Even through the rising inflation of the economy, founder Vultaggio has always wanted his iced tea to be priced at 99 cents. Saying in an interview with Today, \"Why have people who are having a hard time paying their rent have to pay more for our drink?\". Besides iced tea drinks, AriZona also makes many different products including juice, coffee, fruit snacks, tortilla chips, and wearable merchandise. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1992 establishments Category:Companies based in New York (state) Category:Soft drinks",
