According to Tatsumi, the murder attempt was done to protest what he considered to be the mistreatment of the indigenous Ainu people of Hokkaido. The incident occured amidst a larger of anti-Japanese terrorist attacks performed by pro-Ainu organizations like the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front. Giichi survived the attempt, and Tsatsumi was stopped. However, far-left violence in Japan failed to cease.
