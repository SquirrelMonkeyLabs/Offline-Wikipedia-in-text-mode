 "text": "Indigenous Australians are the native people of Australia. They include the Aboriginal Australians as well as Torres Strait Islanders and are often known together as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The first Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers who migrated from Southeast Asia. Scientists do not know exactly when (or how) they arrived, but it was at least 60,000 years ago.Hesp, Patrick A. et al 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. Australian Archaeology, No 49 (1999) Many Indigenous Australians suffered starting in 1788, when the first Europeans arrived. Many caught diseases from the Europeans (British and Irish people) and/or lost their hunting lands. ==History == The first people of Australia were nomads who came to what is now Australia from Southeast Asia at least 60,000 years ago. As hunter-gatherers, they used weapons like boomerangs, sticks, and spears to kill animals for food. When the British came to Australia in 1788, they called the native people \"aboriginals\", meaning people who have lived there since the earliest times. There are now about 650,000 Aboriginal people living in Australia.Australia census: Five takeaways from a changing country\". BBC News. 27 June 2017.Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 Census data == Beliefs == Aboriginal Australians believe in a process of creation called Dreamtime, when their animal, plant, and human ancestors created the world and everything in it. There are many songs and stories about Dreamtime, which generations of Aboriginal people have passed down to their children. == Art == Aboriginal Australians have their own type of art. Paintings of the people, spirits, and animals of Dreamtime cover sacred cliffs and rocks in tribal territories. Some of the pictures are made in red and yellow ochre and white clay. Others have been carved into the rocks. Many are thousands of years old. Modern Aboriginal art is mostly based on old stories about Dreamtime. == Boomerangs == Boomerangs are one of a group of weapons known as \"throwsticks\". The typical boomerang is designed to be self-returning, but it msut be properly thrown. Since boomerangs have been discovered in cultures with no connection with Australia such as in ancient Egypt,Valde-Nowak & others 1987. Upper Palaeolithic boomerang made of a mammoth tusk in south Poland. Nature 329: 436â€“438 (1 October 1987); doi:10.1038/329436a0 they probably developed separately. Modern computer- designed boomerangs may have three or four wings, instead of the traditional two.Jones, Philip 1996. Boomerang: behind an Australian icon. Wakefield Press. ISBN 9781862543829 == Land claims == When the British came to live in Australia, they decided that the land was empty and that nobody \"owned\" the land in the way that Europeans used the word. That was called \"terra nullius\", Latin words for \"empty land\". In 1976, the Australian government gave Aboriginal people the right to use the land where their tribes were originally located. On 3 Jun, 1992, the High Court of Australia said that the idea of terra nullius was wrong, and the government brought in new laws to set up native title. Under the new laws, an Aboriginal person can claim land as Aboriginal land if they can prove that: * They have always used that land. * The land has not been sold. * The land was never changed by government acts. ==Population by region== Region Population Percentage of region 798,365 3.3% 795 == Other websites == *Ceremony The Djungguwan of Northeast Arnhem Land *Aborigines win 'native title' over Perth *Australia's largest circulating Indigenous Affairs Newspaper *Latest Indigenous news from ABC News Online *Indigenous Australians - State Library of NSW *Aboriginal Studies Virtual Library *Department of Indigenous Affairs (Australian Government) *European Network for Indigenous Australian Rights *Indigenous Australia - Australian Museum educational site *KooriWeb *Norman B.
