He played 383 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, and Minnesota North Stars. Goegan started playing hockey on some Fort William teams and then moved for two seasons to the Northern Ontario Hockey Association until joining professional hockey in 1956. He played for two years in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Cleveland Barons, winning a Calder Cup, but in the 1957-58 season he debuted in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Red Wings. In the following seasons he became a defender for the Red Wings team, except for a loan in the Western Hockey League during the 1959-60 championship. In 1962 he played for a few months in the New York Rangers organization, winning another Calder Cup with the Springfield Indians farm team, but in October he returned to the Red Wings. He split five seasons between the NHL team and their AHL affiliate the Pittsburgh Hornets, with whom he won the third Calder Cup in his career. In the summer of 1967 in the NHL Expansion Draft Goegan was selected by the Minnesota North Stars, with which he played a season for a total of 46 games in addition to a Western Hockey League loan. He retired a year later in 1969 after playing in other North American leagues. == Other websites == * Category:1934 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Baltimore Clippers players Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Cleveland Barons (1937â€“1973) players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Minnesota North Stars players Category:New York Rangers players Category:Pittsburgh Hornets players Category:Sportspeople from Thunder Bay Category:Springfield Indians players",
