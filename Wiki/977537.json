 "text": "The South Carolina Gamecocks is the name for the sports teams at the University of South Carolina. The gamecock is also the mascot for the school. Men's sports teams used to be named the \"Fighting Gamecocks\", and women's sports teams used to be named the \"Lady Gamecocks\". The school later started calling all sports teams just \"Gamecocks\" so there was not sexism. All of the school's sports teams play in Division I of the NCAA. Every sport except men's soccer and women's beach volleyball are in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). This is because the SEC does not have these sports. Men's soccer plays in the Sun Belt Conference, and women's beach volleyball plays in the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association. The Gamecocks have won eleven national titles. Many Olympians have been Gamecocks. == References == Category:Organizations based in South Carolina",
