 "text": "Newton MRT station (NS21/DT11) is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station in Singapore. It is an interchange station between the North South MRT Line and Downtown MRT Line. The station was formerly known as Newton Circus. It is one of the stations that is not connected from North South line to Downtown line. The station transit area is public. ==History== The station was opened on 12 December 1987 and the original station code is N4. Downtown Line station was opened on 27 December 2015, reducing the need to take bus services 171 and 700/700A. On 5 October 2017, a Platform screen door on the North South Line platform did not work. The door, which is fitted with sensors to detect when the train doors opens, did not open when the train doors opened. SMRT staffs directed passengers to the nearest working door. A similar case happened at the Downtown Line platform at Botanic Gardens station. On 7 to 8 October, this station was the temporary terminating point for trains travelling from Marina South Pier. This was due to the Bishan tunnel flooding which caused train services to be suspended between Ang Mo Kio and Newton. Normal train services resumed at around 2pm on 8 October. As part of Exercise Station Guard 2018, a security exercise, X-ray machines and metal detectors are used in this station. It is also used as part of a trial in November 2018. ==Exits== *A: Balmoral Plaza, Goldbell Towers, Scotts Rd / Bukit Timah Rd, Sheraton Towers Singapore, Alliance Francaise De Singapour, Prudential@Scotts *B: Cairnhill Community Club, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (NEA, PUB, Newton Food Centre, Scotts Rd / Cairnhill Rd), Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) *C: Alliance Francaise De Singapour, Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road), Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), Balmoral Plaza, Barker Road Methodist Church, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ==Related pages== *Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations Category:1987 establishments in Singapore",
