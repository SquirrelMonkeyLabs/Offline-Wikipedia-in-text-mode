 "text": "Colostethus is a group of poison dart frogs. They live in Central and South America, from Panama to Colombia, to Ecuador, to northern Peru. People call them rocket frogs in English, but frogs not in Colostethus have this name too. ==Groups== In 2006, scientists said they had put too many species in Colostethus, 138. They looked at the genuses again and learned that many of these frogs were not alike enough to be in the same genus. They put some of these frogs in Aromobatidae (e..g., Anomaloglossus) and others to Hyloxalus and Silverstoneia. Some scientists think that some of the frogs in Colostethus should be in Ameerega instead. ==Bodies== The skin of the frog's back is brown in color. There are bumps near the rear end. The frogs have light colored stripes. Adult male frogs' third front toes are big. ==Species== There are 12 species in this genus: ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Poison dart frogs Category:Frogs of South America",
