 "text": "A bathroom (also known as a restroom, washroom, toilet or lavatory) is where people go for personal hygiene activities. This includes use of the toilet, wash their hands, brush their teeth, take a bath, or take a shower. The room may also contain a sink, often called a \"wash basin\", “hair basin” or \"hand basin\" (in parts of the United States) and often a \"lavatory.\" In the United States, \"bathroom\" mostly means \"a room containing a lavatory.\" In other countries this is mostly called the \"toilet\". The word \"bathroom\" is also used in the United States for a public toilet or \"restroom.\" Bathrooms also have bathroom cabinets. ==History== Baths go back to 3,000 B.C. Usually, a town would have a special building for people to take baths, which sometimes were part of a religious ceremony. Starting in the 16th century, public baths started declining. People at this time started building baths inside their homes. ==Variations== Usually, a full bath will have a toilet, a sink, a bathtub and/or a shower. If a bathroom has only a toilet and a sink, then it is called a half bath or a powder room. A master bath is connected to a master bedroom for the use of whoever lives in that bedroom and no one else. A Semi- Ensuit is a Bathroom connected to the master bedroom and also acts as the main bathroom to the rest of the house via a second door, usually found in smaller homes and units with 2-3 bedrooms. A \"Jack and Jill\" Bathroom is usually a bathroom connecting 2 kids bedroom directly to the bathroom via separate doors. Category:Rooms",
