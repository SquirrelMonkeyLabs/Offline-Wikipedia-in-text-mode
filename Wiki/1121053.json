 "text": "The Batsuit (or Bat-Suit) is the costume of DC Comics's fictional superhero Batman. There have been many variations over the years. The Batsuit has an electrical system that can shock assailants as a last resort. The Batsuit is made of triple-weave Kevlar centered around the most obvious target, the chest-mounted Bat symbol. That is partly to lure gunshots to the armor's thickest point. Though the suit has been drawn many different ways by different artists, and the stories themselves have described Batman as changing the details of his costume from time to time, it is most often shown as having a scalloped cape, a bat-like cowl, a pair of gloves, boots, a yellow utility belt, and a tight-fitting body suit with the image of a bat on the chest. Batman wears this costume both to hide who he is and to frighten criminals. Most versions of the Batsuit include some form of body armor, and often night vision, gas filters, and other things that help combat effectiveness or protection. All versions of the outfit have a utility belt containing a variety of crime fighting equipment. Category:Costumes Category:Batman",
