 "text": "Zürich Wilderness Park (Wildnispark Zürich in German) is a nature park located near the city of Zürich in Switzerland. It consists of two main areas: the Sihlwald forest and the Langenberg Wildlife Park. The Sihlwald forest is the biggest mixed forest in the Swiss Mittelland and the Langenberg Wildlife Park is the oldest wildlife park in Switzerland. These sites are located in the Sihl Valley, to the south of Zürich. == History == Hapsburgers gifted the Sihlwald forest to the city of Zürich in 1309 and again in 1524. It provided timber and firewood to the city for many years. Since the 1990s, the forest has been preserved by forest director Andreas Speich, who stopped cutting down trees to protect its unique composition. The Langenberg Wildlife Park was founded in 1869 by city forester Carl Anton Ludwig von Orelli. On August 28, 2009, the Sihlwald forest was named a \"regional nature park of national importance\" by the FOEN (Federal Office for the Environment). Zürich Wilderness Park was officially formed, bringing together the Langenberg Wildlife Park and the Sihlwald forest. Today, the park welcomes more than half a million visitors every year. Visitors can barbecue, hike, cycle, ride horseback through the park. == References == Category:Canton of Zürich Category:National parks in Switzerland",
