 "text": "TheManifesto on Three-Day Serf Labor, also known as Manifesto of three-day corvee was issued by Emperor Paul I of Russia on April 5, 1797. It was the first legal document in Russia aimed at limiting the work of serfs. The manifesto prohibited landlords from forcing serfs to work on Sundays and limited their labor to three days a week for the landlord's benefit. == Reasons for the Manifesto == The manifesto addressed growing concerns about the harsh conditions of serfdom in Russia. Before becoming emperor, Paul I introduced reforms on his estates, such as reducing serf obligations and providing financial support. He aimed to improve the treatment of serfs across the empire. == Interpretation and enforcement issues == Confusion in Implementation: While the manifesto's text outlined two key rules—no work on Sundays and a three-day labor limit—the accompanying decree from the Senate only emphasized the Sunday work ban, omitting the three-day limit. This led to inconsistent interpretations across regions. == Regional responses == Most regional authorities focused only on the Sunday ban. However, some officials, like those in the Vologda Governorate, attempted to enforce both rules, including fair distribution of labor days between serfs and landlords. == Impact and legacy == Despite its intentions, the manifesto had limited practical effect. Landowners often ignored its provisions, and enforcement was weak. The document, however, symbolized early attempts to regulate serfdom and influenced later reforms leading to the abolition of serfdom in 1861. Category:Feudalism in Russia",
