She began her career in 2013 as a contestant on the American version of The X Factor. She was eliminated from the show but was brought back with four other girl contestants to create the group Fifth Harmony. That group finished in third place. She launched a solo career in December 2016, leading to successful songs like \"Crying in the Club\" and \"Havana\", which became her first number- one song in the US. Havanna was number 1 in the UK for four weeks and it still is in the charts. Her debut solo album, Camila, was also at the top of the charts the same week as \"Havana\" did, making her only the third artist to have their first album and a single at the top of the charts at the same time. Loreal ads and commercials == Early life == Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao was born on March 3, 1997, in Cojimar, Cuba. Camila has Cuban and Mexican nationality and citizenship. When she was six, she moved to Miami, Florida, with her Cuban-Mexican mother and Mexican father. She has a younger sister, Sofia (born April 2, 2007). In 2012, at age 15, she entered the second season of the American reality-talent show X Factor where she was grouped with four other young female contestants to form the girl group Fifth Harmony. They ended up placing third in the show, then went on to have success in the mainstream music industry as well, with hits such as Worth It (2015), and Work from Home (2016). == Solo career (2016–present) == On December 18, 2016, Cabello announced that she was leaving Fifth Harmony. Cabello released several singles throughout 2017. Her most successful, \"Havana\", with rapper Young Thug, was released in August of that year, as the lead single from her first solo album. The song was at the top of charts in Canada, Australia, and the UK. After spending seven weeks at number two in the US, the song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending January 27, 2018. Her debut solo album, Camila, was released on January 12, 2018. It entered at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart in the US with over 119,000 combined streams and copies sold. With this, she became only the third artist in history to have their first number-one album and first number-one single in the same week. Only Beyoncé and Britney Spears have done this before in 2003 and 1999, respectively. ==Personal life== She began dating Canadian singer Shawn Mendes in July 2019. The relationship caused controversy, as both were accused of attempting to form a relationship for publicity, but Mendes insisted it was \"definitely not a publicity stunt\". The relationship was confirmed after the release of their song \"Señorita\". In November 2021, Cabello and Mendes announced their breakup. == References == == Other websites == * * * * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American pop singers Category:American R&B; singers Category:Singers from Miami Category:American singer-songwriters Category:People from Havana Category:Musicians from Havana Category:Actors from Havana Category:21st- century American singer-songwriters Category:MTV Video Music Award winners Category:American actors",
