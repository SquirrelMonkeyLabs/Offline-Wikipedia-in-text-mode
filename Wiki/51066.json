 "text": "Thrash metal is an extreme metal type of heavy metal music that is characterised by its high speed and aggression. ==Origins== The origins of thrash metal are generally traced to the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a number of bands began incorporating the sound of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal with elements of hardcore punk and more specifically Thrashcore, creating a new genre and developing into a separate movement from punk rock. This genre is much more aggressive compared to its relative, speed metal. ==Thrash metal bands== * Anthrax * Artillery * As I Lay Dying * Celtic Frost * Coroner * D.R.I. * Dark Angel * Death Angel * Deaths Head * Defiance * Destroyer 666 * Excel * Exodus * Flotsam and Jetsam * Forbidden * Hellhammer * Helloween * Kreator * Megadeth * Mercenary * Metal Church * Metallica * Mortal Sin * Nevermore * Overkill * Onslaught * Pantera * Sepultura * Sabbat * Sanctuary * Shadows Fall * Slayer * Suicidal Tendencies * Tankard * Testament * Trivium * Venom * Voivod ==References== Category:Heavy metal subgenres",
