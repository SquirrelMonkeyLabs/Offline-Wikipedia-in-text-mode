 "text": "One World Trade Center (also known as One WTC or Freedom Tower) is the main building of the new World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The building is tall making it the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. Since late 2013, it is the tallest building in the United States. It opened in late 2014. It is mostly used for offices. People can view the city from an observatory near the top. The building was designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The building has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The building was built on the spot where the original 6 World Trade Center once stood. Construction for the building started in 2006. On April 30, 2012, One World Trade Center became New York City's tallest structure, when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building. On May 10, 2013, the last piece of the skyscraper's antenna was put on, making the building's height 1,776 feet (541 m). The height of the building was done on purpose to refer to the year when the Declaration of Independence was signed, 1776. On March 26, 2009, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) said that the building would be officially known by its legal name of \"One World Trade Center\", rather than its colloquial name of \"Freedom Tower\". The building has 94 stories, with the top floor numbered 104. The new World Trade Center complex will have five high-rise office buildings built. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood, was also built. The construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex. ==Height controversy== On November 8, 2013, architects in Chicago and New York City began debating about the height of the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower. They were saying that there was a possibility that the Willis Tower is taller than the One World Trade Center. On November 12, a committee agreed that the antenna on top is part of the building, so One World Trade Center is taller than the Willis Tower. Even after removing the antennas from the measurement, One World Trade Center is about 325 feet (99 m) taller than the Willis Tower. == Gallery == File:Freedomtower_oct2006.jpg|October 7, 2006 File:Wtcsite-2007oct7.jpg|October 7, 2007 File:FreedomTowerFromWTC7.JPG|September 10, 2008 ==References== ==Other websites== * Freedom Tower news Category:2013 establishments in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 21st century Category:September 11 attacks Category:Skyscrapers in New York City Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan",
