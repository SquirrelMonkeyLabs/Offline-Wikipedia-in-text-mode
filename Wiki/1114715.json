 "text": "A dust mask is a type of mask that is used to protect someone from dust that might hurt them. Some say it is a respirator. But a dust mask lets a lot of dust in. This is not like most respirators. This is also not like a N95. A N95 has to be checked with a harder NIOSH rating. NIOSH used to check dust masks. When 42 CFR Part 84 was made, NIOSH stopped checking dust masks. In Europe, governments still check dust masks. They check dust masks under FFP1 rules. FFP1 is the lowest FFP rule. It lets 22% of air go by the filter. The filter here is the dust mask. Tuberculosis and viruses can go past a dust mask to the nose and mouth. ==References== ==Related pages== *NIOSH ratings *FFP rules Category:Protective clothing Category:Headgear",
