 "text": "Elections happened in Mauritania on 13 May 2023 and 27 May 2023. These elections happened to pick who was in the parliament. Elections for the leaders of municipalities and provinces happened too. These were the first parliamentary elections after the 2019 presidential election. That election was the first time the president of Mauritania changed without a coup happening. ==Behavior== CENI said while looking at the votes that it saw that someone messed with them in the El Mina department of Nouakchott. Some votes were moved from the null and neutral cards to one of the candidates. They said that they fixed it. Judicial procedures had happened after a candidate said that they did not like the results. ==Results== ===Overall=== Party National PR list Total Votes % Seats ± Seats ± El Insaf 342,153 35.26% 7 +3

Mohamed Bemba Meguett was picked in the first round. Candidate Candidate Party Votes obtained Required majority → Required majority → Required majority → 89 out of 176 Mohamed Bemba Meguett 137 Ahmedou Mohamed Mahfoudh M'Balla 27 Abstentions Abstentions 2 Null votes Null votes 3 Absentees Absentees Absentees 7 ===Arrest of Biram Dah Abeid=== Biram Dah Abeid was arrested on 24 May. He was the leader of the Democratic Alternation Coalition and re-elected deputy for Sawab+. He was arrested because he said that if the results of the elections are accepted, then \"the free Mauritanians will carry weapons against the current regime\" during a rally the day before. He also said in his speech that he was \"committed to peace\" but that he \"wouldn't lie to the Mauritanian people\" and that \"election fraud was the reason the army couped former president Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya\". Opposition parties RAG, Sawab, Hope Mauritania, the Union of the Forces of Progress, the Rally of Democratic Forces, and the People's Progressive Alliance said that the arrest was bad. ==References== Category:Politics of Mauritania Category:2023 elections Category:2023 in Africa Category:May 2023 events",
