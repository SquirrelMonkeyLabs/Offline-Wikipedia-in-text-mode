 "text": "The WAGR Pm class were a total of 18 express steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1950 to 1972. The Pm class were built by the North British Locomotive Coy in 1949 to specifications almost identical to the standard P class, with slight alterations. Although originally designated for express passenger traffic, due to having independently sprung wheels, which caused rough riding they were reassigned to goods work. Because of this, they were assigned to heavy and express goods on the Eastern Goldfields Railway and Great Southern Railway where they were well-suited, later serving on the South Western mainline until the end of steam on the WAGR, with withdrawals starting in 1970 and ending in 1972. Unlike the Pmr class, they had roller bearings on their trailing, leading and tender wheels, and not on their driving wheels. Two are preserved, No. 701 is displayed at the Bassendean Railway Museum and No. 706 was originally displayed at Narrogin before entering excursion service and is currently stored at Pinjarra on the Hotham Valley Railway due to weight restrictions on the line.
