The Geysers has 22 separate power plants that use steam from more than 350 producing wells. The Calpine Corporation operates and owns 19 of the 22 facilities. == History == The Geysers was found by European Americans. It was named in 1847 by John Fremont during his research. Between 1848 and 1854, Geysers worked as a spa complex The Geysers Resort Hotel. It was visited by such famous people as Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Twain. But in 1938, the main building was destroyed in a landslide. Five of the Geysers plants were destroyed in the Valley Fire of September 2015. The Geysers Geothermal Power Development project was named as a California Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. == Other geothermal power plants == Rank Station Country Location Capacity (MW) 1 The Geysers 1808 2 Cerro Prieto 958 3 Hellishei√∞i 303 4 Olkaria 260 5 Darajat 255 6 Malitbog 233 Energy Development Corporation: Geothermal Operating Sites , retrieved 24 March 2011 7 Wayang Windu 227 8 Kamojang 203 9 Navy 240 ==References== Category:Power plants Category:Energy in California Category:Geothermal energy",
