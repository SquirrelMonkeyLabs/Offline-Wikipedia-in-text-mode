 "text": "The Detroit Grand Prix is a car racing event held in Detroit, Michigan, USA. From 1982 to 1988 it was a part of the Formula One series. It has been a part of the IndyCar Series since 1988. In 1982, the U.S. became the first country to host three World Championship Grands Prix in one season. As of 2010, it is the only one to do so. In addition to the US GP West and Caesars Palace GP races, the new event was held on another street course, in the Renaissance Center of Detroit. The original circuit had seventeen corners in 2.493 miles, and included a tunnel and a railroad track crossing. For 1989, it was planned to move the Grand Prix to a new circuit at Belle Isle. However, an agreement could not be reached, and the Grand Prix moved to Phoenix in 1989. After Formula One stopped racing at Detroit, CART held a similar event in its place. The CART event was held on the same track except the 18th turn, a chicane, was removed. In 1992, the race was moved to Belle Isle, an island in the Detroit River. Since then, the race has been held in Belle Isle from 1992 to 2001, 2007 to 2008, and from 2012 to 2022. In 2023, the race track was moved roughly two miles to return to downtown Detroit. The race has been held on the street circuit since. ==Winners== === Repeat winners (drivers)=== Wins Driver Years won 3 Ayrton Senna 1986, 1987, 1988 ===Repeat winners (constructors)=== Wins Constructor Years won 2 Lotus 1986, 1987 2 McLaren 1982, 1988 ===Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)=== Wins Manufacturer Years won 3 Honda 1985, 1987, 1988 2 Ford * 1982, 1983 * Built by Cosworth === By year=== Year Driver Constructor Report John Watson McLaren-Ford Report Michele Alboreto Tyrrell- Ford Report Nelson Piquet Brabham-BMW Report Keke Rosberg Williams-Honda Report Ayrton Senna Lotus-Renault Report Ayrton Senna Lotus-Honda Report Ayrton Senna McLaren-Honda Report ==Broadcasting== ===United Kingdom=== Year Network Lap-by-lap Colour commentator(s) BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt ==Related pages== * United States Grand Prix * United States Grand Prix West * Caesars Palace Grand Prix * Dallas Grand Prix ==References== Category:Formula One Grands Prix Category:Detroit Category:1982 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Michigan Category:1988 disestablishments in the United States Category:20th-century disestablishments in Michigan",
