 "text": "Ingrian, also called Izhorian, is a Finnic language spoken in Ingria, Russia. It is almost extinct, as it only has about 142 native speakers left. Most of these are elderly. This has happened because many people who speak Finnish moved there, meaning most people in Ingria now speak Finnish. ==References== Category:Finnic languages Category:Languages of Russia",
