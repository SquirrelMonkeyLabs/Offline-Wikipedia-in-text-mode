 "text": "Hurricane Ike was one of the most damaging tropical cyclones in United States history, having caused about $38 billion dollars in damage. It was the sixth- costliest Atlantic hurricane in U.S. history. Hurricane Ike was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane and the most-intense hurricane of 2008 in terms of pressure. Ike may have caused up to 195 deaths. Most deaths happened in Haiti and the U.S. together. Haiti was still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Hanna. == Storm history == The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ike started near the west coast of Africa on August 28. The storm grew quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the storm formed into Tropical Depression Nine when the storm was over the central Atlantic Ocean. Later that day Tropical Depression Nine became Tropical Storm Ike. == After the storm == In spring 2009, the name \"Ike\" was retired due to severe damage it caused, particularly in Texas. It was replaced by \"Isaias\" for the 2014 season. == Notes and references == === Notes === === References === Category:2008 Atlantic hurricane season Category:2008 in the United States Category:2008 in Canada Category:2000s in Cuba Category:Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes Category:2000s in the Dominican Republic Category:2000s in Haiti Category:Hurricanes in the United States Category:2000s in the Bahamas Category:Turks and Caicos Islands Category:Natural disasters in Canada Category:Hurricanes in Texas Category:Hurricanes in Louisiana Category:History of British Overseas Territories Category:Retired tropical cyclone names",
