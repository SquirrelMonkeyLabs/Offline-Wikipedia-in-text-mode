 "text": "On 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin said that four Ukrainian oblasts would now be part of Russia. These are the oblasts Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. These oblasts make up about 15% of the territory of Ukraine. Before the annexation, the people were asked if they wanted to join Russia. Because this vote happened during a conflict, and was done by one of the parties involved in the conflict, it is against international law. Because of the conflict, much of the population had left. This annexation is the largest in Europe, beating Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. It also made a land connection between Crimea and European Russia. Because of the problems involved, no other state recognized this annexation except for North Korea. Ukraine, the European Union, the United States, and the United Nations have all said that the referendums and annexation had no legal basis or effect. As a response to the annexation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would apply to join NATO. The size of the territory annexed is about , comparable to the size of Hungary or Portugal. On 27 September, Russian officials claimed that the annexation \"referendum\" in Zaporizhzhia Oblast passed, with 93.11% of voters in favour of joining the Russian Federation.; Another problem is that fighting is still ongoing, and Russian forces do not control all of the territory they claim they annexed. == Reactions == A United Nations Security Council meeting was held on 30 September 2022 to vote on a resolution to punish Russia on annexation of these territories, resulting in 10 yes votes, 1 no vote and 4 abstentions. The resolution failed to pass due to Russia vetoing it. Brazil, China, Gabon, and India abstained from the vote. === Ukrainian response === On 7 August 2022, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that \"if the occupiers proceed along the path of pseudo-referendums they will close for themselves any chance of talks with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will clearly need at some point.\" After the ceremony of annexation, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would not negotiate with Russia \"as long as Putin is president\", and requested a \"fast-track\" NATO membership in response. == Related pages == * Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation ==Notes== == References == Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Category:Russo- Ukrainian War Category:September 2022 events",
