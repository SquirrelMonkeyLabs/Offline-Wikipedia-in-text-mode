 "text": "AIDS treatment is not a cure, but it stops the Aids virus from multiplying. The official name for the AIDS virus is the human immunodeficiency virus or viruses (HIV). The drugs keep sufferers alive, and also prevent them from passing in the infection to other people. There is at present no actual cure for AIDS. What is changed is the development of anti-viral drugs. Patients have to take the drug capsules for the rest of their lives. It is thought that some 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by the antiviral drug. The Lancet says \"Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications, clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades\".\" They are saying something like: \"AIDS will be with us a long time because this saves lives, but it's not a cure\". However, it is a first step towards a cure. == References == Category:HIV/AIDS",
