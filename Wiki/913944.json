Al-Jabr was important in the history of mathematics, the term \"algebra\" itself derived from Al-Jabr. == Area and volume == The book show ways of finding area and volume. These include approximations of pi (π), as 3 1/7, √10, and 62832/20000. This latter approximation, this equals 3.1416, which appeared in Āryabhaṭīya (499 CE).B.L. van der Waerden, A History of Algebra: From al-Khwārizmī to Emmy Noether; Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1985. ==References== Category:Mathematics books Category:9th-century works Category:Arabic literature",
