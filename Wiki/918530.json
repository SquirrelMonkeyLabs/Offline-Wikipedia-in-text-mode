 "text": "An inkanyamba is a kind of eel that is found in some legends. The legends tell about a gigantic, winged eel with a big appetite that is associated with extreme storms. The Inkanyamba is also a legendary serpent said to be living in a waterfall lake in the northern forests near Pietermaritzburg, most commonly in the base of Howick Falls, South Africa. The Zulu people of the area believe it to be a large serpent with an equine head. It is a very tall creature. It is invisible, so no one has ever seen it. Inkanyamba in English means the deity of tornadoes, taking the form of a black snake. Category:Legendary creatures",
