 "text": "Shurat Islam (Arabic: شُرَُیَعَتْ اِسْلَاَمْ), formerly known as Kharijites (Arabic: عَلْخَوَاَرِجْ), was a branch of Islam. It was one of the three main branches of Islam, along with Shia Islam and Sunni Islam. Though, the branch has no followers today, the Ibadi movement is seen as a moderate current demonization of Shurat Islam. However, Ibadis reject themselves being Shuratis. Initially, Muslims were divided into two groups, Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. After caliph Uthman's death, Ali and Muawiya I were warring. At this time, the Shurati Muslims emerged, who did not pledge allegiance to Ali or Muawiya I. Rather than allegiance, Shurati Muslims decided to attack Ali and Muawiya I's followers and takfir them. Sometimes, the term Kharijite (or Neo-Kharijite) is also used for some Islamic militant groups. Examples of such groups are the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or the Takfir wal-Hijra in Egypt. == References == Category:Islamic denominations",
