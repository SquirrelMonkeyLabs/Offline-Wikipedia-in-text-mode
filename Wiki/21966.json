 "text": "Ovaries (singular: Ovary) are organs found in female organisms. Ovaries are part of the reproductive system needed to reproduce sexually. Most vertebrate animals have two ovaries. Birds usually have only one working ovary; snakes have one ovary in front of the other. The ovaries are similar to testicles in male organisms. == Anatomy == Ovaries are shaped like ovals. They are around 3 cm by 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm. The ovaries are found in the side walls of the pelvis. Each ovary is attached to a fallopian tube, each of which is attached to the uterus. Usually each ovary takes turns releasing eggs every month. == Uses == : Ovaries have two purposes. They produce female sex hormones that help puberty take place. Ovaries also produce ova (also called \"egg cells\"), which are the female reproductive cells. === In menstruation === During menstruation, an ovum is released from the ovary and enters one of the fallopian tubes. There, the ovum can be fertilised. Ovaries have a certain number of eggs in them; when eggs stop being released, this is the start of the menopause. During this time, female hormones stop being produced. ==Related pages== * Cervix * Female reproductive system * Vagina == Other websites == * Merck Online Medical Library: Female Reproductive System Category:Anatomy of the female reproductive system Category:Female reproductive system Category:Pregnancy and childbirth",
