 "text": "Canon is the realm of work within a fictional series/franchise that is said to have \"actually happened\". It provides the groundwork and basis for all non- canon material to be based off of, as well as future canon material. Usually, that which makes a part of a fictional universe canon is determined by those with creative authority over the intellectual property, such as the original creator or the company that it belongs to. Examples of things that are not canon are derivative fanworks, \"what-if\" alternate scenarios, dreams or hallucinations of the characters, or other things that do not tie into the main story. Such things can be categorized as \"fiction fiction\", as it is fictional to the characters within the medium. It can be argued that real life has a canon, with events that actually happened being history and alternative scenarios/history being non-canon to real life. Category:Fictional universes",
