 "text": "The North–South Expressway is a toll road network on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It has two main routes, north and south, covering 772 kilometers (480 miles). The expressway goes through seven states and links Thailand and Singapore, making it vital for traffic. The idea for the expressway came in 1977 because of traffic jams on the old main road, federal route 1. But money problems delayed the project. It started again in 1981 when Mahathir Mohamad became Prime Minister. The expressway opened in parts from 1982, and the whole thing was finished in 1994. Tolls from the open sections paid for the rest of the construction. Category:Transport in Malaysia Category:Roads in Asia",
