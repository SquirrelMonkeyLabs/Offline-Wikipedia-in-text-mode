 "text": "The Cordillera Central tree frog (Hyloscirtus larinopygion) is a frog. It lives in Colombia and Ecuador on the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Occidental. Scientists have seen it between 1950 and 3100 meters above sea level. One female frog was 53.7 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin on the frog's back is brown. There are no stripes or spots on the back. Parts of the sides and legs are blue with black marks. There is a little webbed skin on the front feet and more on the back feet. This frog's head is as wide as its body. There are fewer of these frogs than there were in the past. Human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans cut down trees for wood and to make farms or places for animals to eat grass. Chemicals that people use to kill pests can also kill this frog. This frog's name comes from the Greek words \"larinos,\" whch is \"fat,\" and \"pygos,\" which means \"buttocks.\" Together, the name means \"frog with the swollen rear end.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
