 "text": "Brisbane Water National Park is a national park in the east of the Australian state of New South Wales, 47 kilometres northeast of Sydney. It lies north of the mouth of the Hawkesbury River and was named after the Brisbane Water lagoon between Gosford and Woy Woy, which borders the park to the east. The western and northern borders are formed by the Pacific Highway. The park consists of steep sandstone cliffs overgrown with forest. There are many hiking trails in the park that can be classified from easy to difficult. One route that is easily accessible by public transport is to Pindar Cave on the rock step above Wondabyne Station, a on-demand stop on the Central Coast Railway Line (Sydney-Newcastle) which is also the only train station in Australia inaccessible by road.Pindar Cave.
