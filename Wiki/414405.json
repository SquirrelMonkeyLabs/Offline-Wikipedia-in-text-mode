It was produced by Centropolis Entertainment, Emmerich's production company, and distributed by Columbia Pictures. It is based upon the 2012 phenomenon, which was a number of beliefs that destructive events would occur on or around December 21, 2012. It was released on November 13, 2009. Critics gave it mixed reviews. They liked its special effects, but were critical of its length (158 minutes) and screenwriting. It made $770 million worldwide. ==Plot== Neutrinos from a very large solar flare from the sun cause the temperature of Earth to increase at a very fast rate, eventually causing a very large geological and meterological disaster. The plot follows Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) as he tries to bring his children, Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate Curtis (Amanda Peet), and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy) to safety from the destructive events that occur. Among these events, a very large earthquake causes California to fall into the Pacific Ocean, the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, and a very large tsunami hits the United States. == Cast == * John Cusack as Jackson Curtis * Chiwetel Ejiofor as Dr. Adrian Helmsley * Amanda Peet as Kate Curtis * Thandie Newton as Laura Wilson * Oliver Platt as Carl Anheuser * Thomas McCarthy as Gordon Silberman * Danny Glover as the President Thomas Wilson * Woody Harrelson as Charlie Frost * Liam James as Noah Curtis * Morgan Lily as Lily Curtis * Zlatko Buric as Yuri Karpov * Beatrice Rosen as Tamara * Jimi Mistry as Dr. Satnam Tsurutani * John Billingsley as Professor West * Blu Mankuma as Harry Helmsley * George Segal as Tony Delgatto * Johann Urb as Sasha * Stephen McHattie as Captain Michaels ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:2009 movies Category:2000s disaster movies Category:2009 science fiction movies Category:2000s American adventure movies Category:American disaster movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:2000s English-language movies Category:Movies directed by Roland Emmerich Category:Post-apocalyptic movies Category:Movies set in France Category:Movies set in India Category:Movies set in Las Vegas Category:Movies set in London Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Movies set in Nevada Category:Movies set in New York City Category:Movies set in Paris Category:Movies set in the United Kingdom Category:Movies set in Vatican City Category:Movies set in Washington, D.C.
