 "text": "Naturist Christians are the Christians who practice naturism or nudism, and are a part of the clothes-free movement. They believe that the human body was the greatest making of God. It is not shameful and should not be covered. Naturist Christians can be found in almost all of the different groups of Christianity, called \"denominations\". They do not find any conflict with the teachings of the Bible, and living their lives and worshiping God without any clothing. However, most have various differences with New Age and man-centered philosophy (called \"humanism\") which is common among other naturists and wish to be separated from it. This includes not worshiping nature at all. ==Garden of Eden== In the Book of Genesis, Adam and Eve were living in the Garden of Eden as 'man and wife' . They ate the fruit not allowed by God, after being talked into it by the devil in the form of a snake. Then their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked. So, they gathered fig leaves to be used as simple clothing to cover their sexual organs. These became lacking very quickly, and Adam and Eve hid themselves from God in the trees. * God to Adam (with Eve) \"Who told you that you are naked?\" () naturism Category:Christian movements and denominational families",
