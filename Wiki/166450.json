 "text": "London Calling is the third studio album by the English punk rock band the Clash. It was released in 1979 (1980 in the U.S). The album represented a significant change in the Clash's musical style, which now featured major elements of ska, funk, pop, soul, jazz, rockabilly and reggae far more prominently than in their previous two albums.Guarisco, Donald A. [ \"Rudie Can't Fail Review\"]. Allmusic. Retrieved 18 February 2008. ==Track listing== All lead vocals by Joe Strummer, except where noted. * On the original version of the album, \"Train in Vain\" was not listed on the sleeve, nor the label on the record itself, but a sticker indicating the track was affixed to the outer cellophane wrapper. It was also scratched into the vinyl in the run-off area on the fourth side of the album. Later editions included the song in the track listing. ==References== Category:1979 albums Category:The Clash albums Category:Punk albums Category:Reggae albums",
