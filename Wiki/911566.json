 "text": "Neuter (, calque from Greek [ud√©teron], neither one nor the other) is a grammatical gender, a linguistic class of nouns triggering specific types of inflections in associated words. The neuter was present in most Indo-European languages together with masculine and feminine. It was perhaps originally used for objects. The distinction between masculinum, femininum and neuter was already clear to the Latin grammarians, who got this lesson from the Alexandrian grammarians. Neuter still exists in Germanic languages, Slavic languages and Greek. In the Romance languages it has almost disappeared. It is a neuter pronoun. Category:Grammar Category:Gender",
