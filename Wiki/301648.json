 "text": "Taglish and Englog are the names of the mixed language family that developed in Manila from the of English and Tagalog languages, the common languages of the Philippines. There are several versions of it, including Coño English, Jejenese and Swardspeak. There are attempts to differentiate the usage of Taglish and Englog where Taglish refers to the usage of English words in Tagalog syntax while Englog refers to the usage of Tagalog words in English syntax. Taglish and Englog are used by Filipinos in countries like Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It is used in text messages to write more quickly. ==Characteristics== Taglish (or Englog) is a language of Manila created by mixing the English and the Tagalog languages together.Wikang Taglish, Kamulatang Taglish, article by Virgilio S. Almario.PAGASA VOWS : No more jargon, just plain ‘Taglish,’ in weather reports . The Philippine Daily Inquirer. Posted date: March 23, 2011. The language is used because Tagalog words are longer than words in English. Example: English Tagalog Taglish / Englog Can you explain it to me? Maaaring ipaunawa mo sa akin? Maaaring i-explain mo sa akin? Can you shed light on it for me? Pakipaliwanag mo sa akin? Paki-explain mo sa akin? Have you finished your homework? Natapos mo na ba yung takdang-aralin mo? Finish na ba yung homework mo? Please call the driver. Pakitawag ang tsuper. Paki-call ang driver. English action words, and even some naming words, can be Tagalog action words. This is done by the addition of one or more prefixes or infixes and by the doubling of the first sound of the starting form of the action or naming word. The English action word drive can be changed to the Tagalog word magda-drive meaning will drive (used in place of the Tagalog word magmamaneho). The English naming word Internet can also be changed to the Tagalog word nag-Internet meaning have used the Internet. Taglish and Englog also use sentences of mixed English or Tagalog words and phrases. The conjunctions used to connect them can come from eany of the two. Some examples include: English Tagalog Taglish / Englog I will shop at the mall later. Bibili ako ako sa pamilihan mamayà. Magsya- shopping ako sa mall mamayà. Have you printed the report? Naimprenta mo na ba ang ulat? Na-print mo na ba ang report? Please turn on the aircon. Pakibuksan yung erkon. Pakibuksan yung aircon. Take the train to school. Mag-tren ka papuntang paaralan. Mag-train ka papuntang school. I am not going to relate to the topic of the lecture. Hindi ako makaintindi sa paksa ng talumpati niya. Hindi ako maka-relate sa topic ng lecture niya.Taglish is not the enemy . October 30, 2006 12:00 AM. The Philippine Star. Could you fax your estimate tomorrow.

This is a subculture in the Philippines, made up of people who try to change the English language to better suit Spanish and Filipino. Their alphabet, Jejebet, is based on Leet. Words are created by mixing letters in a word, mixed large and small letters, using the letters H, X or Z many times, and mixing of numbers in words. The spelling is the same as in Leet. ===Swardspeak=== Swardspeak is a kind of Taglish and Englog used by gay people. It is a form of slang. Swardspeak uses words from Tagalog, English, Spanish, Cebuano, Japanese, Sanskrit, and other languages. Names of Celebrities and trademark brands are also used. ===Coño English=== Coño English (tl: Konyo) or Colegiala English (es: ) is a creole of Taglish and Englog that originated from the children in rich families of Manila. The word coño itself came from the Spanish word coño. It is a form of Philippine English that has Spanish and Tagalog words. Unlike other forms of Taglish and Englog, Coño English sounds more gentle and feminine. The most common aspect of Coño English is the building of action words using the English action word make with the base form of a Tagalog action word. Examples: English Tagalog Coño English Let's skewer the fishballs. Tusukin natin ang mga pishbol. Let's make tusok-tusok the fishballs. Tell me what happened... Ikwento mo sa akin kung ano ang nangyari... Make me kwento about what happened... Sometimes, Tagalog interjections such as ano, naman, pa, na (or nah), no (or noh), a (or ha), e (or eh), and o (or oh) are placed to add emphasis. No and a (from the Tagalog word ano) are used for questions and are added to the end of a sentence only. Ano (meaning what) is also used for questions and is placed in the front or the end. E (added to answers to questions) and o (for statements) are used for exclamations and are added to the front only. Pa (meaning not yet, not yet done, to continue, or still) and na (meaning now, already, or already done) can be placed in the middle or end. Naman (same as na but mostly for emphasis only) is placed anywhere. The interjection no? (equal to the Spanish ¿no? and the German nicht?) is pronounced as or (with a pure vowel instead of the English glide), which shows influence from Spanish. English Tagalog Coño English It's so hot; can you please fan me? Naiinitan na ako; paypayan mo naman ako. Grabe, it's so hot; can you fan me naman ? Wait here first while I fetch my friend, all right? Hintayin mo ako habang sinusundo ko ang kaibigan ko, a? Wait here muna while I make sundo my friend, a? What, you're still gonna eat that apple after it fell on the floor? Ano, kakainin mo pa ang mansanas na'yan matapos mahulog na iyan sa sahig? O, you'll eat that apple pa after it fell on the floor? English description words are often replaced with Tagalog action words. The language also has many Spanish words or Spanish words like baño (\"bathroom\"), tostado (\"toasted\") and jamón (\"ham\"). English Tagalog Coño English They're really good! Magaling sila! They're so galing! Where's the bathroom? Nasaan ang CR? Where's the baño? Keep my ham on the grill. Itago mo lang ang hamon ko sa ihawan. Leave my jamón on the grill muna. I want my ham toasted. Gusto kong tostado ang hamon ko. I want my jamón tostado. Due to the feminine sound of Coño English, male speakers sometimes overuse the Tagalog word pare (which means \"pal\" or \"buddy\"), in order to make it sound more masculine. Sometimes tsong (whose meaning is the same) is used instead of pare or with it.Examples below: English Tagalog Coño English Dude, he's so unreliable. Pare, ang labo niya. Pare, he's so malabo. Dude, he's so unreliable. Pare tsong, ang labo niya. Pare tsong, he's so f**king malabo. ==References== Category:Austronesian languages Category:Dialects of English Category:Filipino culture Category:Romance languages",
