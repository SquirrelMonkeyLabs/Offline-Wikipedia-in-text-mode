Wilhelm retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages in baseball history. Wilhelm coached the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves many years after his retirement. He was a resident of Sarasota, Florida for a long time and died in a nursing home of heart failure in 2002. ==Early Life== Wilhem was born on July 26, 1922, in Huntersville, North Carolina. His parents, John and Ethel (née Stanley) Wilhelm, were tenant farmers and had eleven children. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There he started trying to throw the knuckleball. Because he could not throw very fast, he thought that being able to throw a knuckleball would make him successful. He used a tennis ball to practice. Wilhem started playing Minor League Baseball in 1942. He served in the United States Army during World War II. Wilhem fought in the Battle of the Bulge and was wounded. He also earned the Purple Heart award. In the military, Wilhem reached the rank of staff sergeant. He was nicknamed \"Old Sarge\" because he served in the military. After serving in the military, he returned to playing minor league baseball in 1946. The New York Giants drafted Wilhem in the 1947 minor league draft. This is when he started playing in the major leagues. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Sportspeople from North Carolina Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:California Angels players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame members",
