 "text": "The General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) is a set of exams taken in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and other British territories. They are usually taken by students aged 15â€“16, after two years of study. Some students can take their exams early if their teachers think the students are capable. Most students taking their GCSEs study between 5 and 25 subjects. All pupils have to study English, mathematics and science until they are 15-16. They do not have to take the GCSE exams, but the large majority do so. In Wales, students must also study Welsh until they are 14. Most schools require that a pupil passes 5 or more GCSE exams at grades 4 or 5 or above before they can move on to study A-levels. In 2020, the exams were cancelled for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51980831 == Subjects == Many of the subjects in this list are not offered by every school. ===Required=== In all schools students have to study Mathematics, Science, and English linguistics and literature. ===Creativity=== * Art * Art Textiles * Film studies * Textiles * Music * Design and Technology * Drama * Dance * Performing arts * Food technology ===Languages=== * Modern foreign languages including: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Spanish, Somali, Turkish, Tamil, Urdu and Welsh * Classical languages including: Classical Greek, Biblical Hebrew and Latin ===Technology=== * Electronics * Engineering and Manufacturing (Double Award) * Graphic products * Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ** Applied ICT (Double Award) * Product Design ** Electronics with Resistant Materials ** Resistant Materials ** Systems and Control Technology ** Textiles ** IT ===Humanities=== * Humanities * Geography * Religious Studies * History * Citizenship * Philosophy & Ethics * Economics * Hinduism * Islamic Studies ===People and society-related=== * Citizenship (Personal Social Health Education) * Health and Social Care (Double Award) * Home Economics: Child Development * Home Economics: Food and Nutrition * Law * Psychology * Social Science * Sociology ===Natural sciences=== * Astronomy * Geology * Human Biology * Human Physiology and Health * Physics * Chemistry * Biology ===Others=== * Further Mathematics (Further Pure Mathematics for Edexcel IGCSE) * Applied Business (Double Award) * Archaeology (may not currently be available as a separate GCSE ) * Business Studies * Business and Communication Systems * General Studies * Outdoor Pursuits - Birdwatching - Fishing * Physical Education (PE) * Sports Studies * Statistics * Media Studies == A-levels - Exams taken after GCSEs == *International GCSE - GCSE exams for students whose first language is not English. *Standard Grades - Similar exams taken in Scotland == References == ==Other websites== Category:Education in the United Kingdom",
