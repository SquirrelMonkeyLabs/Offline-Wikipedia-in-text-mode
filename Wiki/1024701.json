 "text": "The green flying frog, small flying tree frog, Reinwardti's frog, Reinwardti's flying frog, Reinwardti's tree frog, Reinwardti's gliding frog, or black- webbed tree frog (Rhacophorus reinwardtii) is a frog. It lives in Indonesia. Scientists think it might also live in India, Thailand, and Malaysia. Scientists have seen it as high as 1400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 41.6-52.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 55.4-79.6 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is dark green with spots. There is also a black stripe on the side with light blue spots. All four feet have webbed skin. The frog's belly is white in color. This frog lives high in the tree branches. Scientists think the frog eats insects there. The frog comes down to the ground to lay its eggs in pools of water. Many frogs come ot the same pool at the same time. The tadpoles can be as alarge as 60 mm. The tadpole is gray-brown with black spots. There are fewer of this frog than there were. Scientists think this is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. This frog needs forests to live in. Human beings turn forests into farms. The frog cannot live in forests that have had more than a little logging or building. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
