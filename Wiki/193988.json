 "text": "The Avro Vulcan (also Avro 698 Vulcan) is a delta wing bomber aircraft. It was part of the RAF V bombers which were used by the Royal Air Force as a nuclear deterrent during the Cold War. The other aircraft in the V bombers were the Vickers and Valiant. The Vulcan was also used for long-distance bombing runs during the Falklands War. ==Development== In 1947, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence said it needed a bomber aircraft that could fly a long way and very high. It also needed to carry a lot of bombs. The prototype Vulcan flew in 1948. It crashed in 1949, but development carried on. Over 100 aircraft were built between 1956 and 1965. ==Use== The crew of the Vulcan was made up of five people – two pilots, two navigators and one electronics officer. The Vulcan was originally used as part of the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent. It carried the United Kingdom's first nuclear weapon, called Blue Danube. The Vulcan was also used sometimes for reconnaissance. It was retired from the Royal Air Force in 1984. == Technical data (Vulcan B Mk.2)== Data Units Years of production 1956-1965 Manufacturer Avro Wingspan 33,80 m Length 30,40 m Hight 8,20 m Wing area 368,20 m² Weight (empty) - kg Max takeoff weight 113.398 kg Passangers - Crew 5 Speed 1038 km/h Service ceiling 19.810 m Range 7.400 km Powerplants 4*Rolls-Royce Olympus 301 turbine Flugzeuge-Die wichtigsten Flugzeuge der Welt ==References== ==Other websites== *Vulcan To The Sky Category:Royal Air Force aircraft",
