Literal translationTranslation by David Chikvaidze. Our icon is the homeland Trust in God is our creed, Enlightened land of plains and mounts, Blessed by God and holy heaven. Freedom we have learnt to follow Makes our future spirits stronger, Morning star will rise above us And lighten up the land between the two seas. Glory to long-cherished freedom, Glory liberty! My icon is my motherland, And the whole world is its icon-stand, Bright mounts and valleys Are shared with God. Today our freedom Sings to the glory of the future, The dawn star rises up And shines out between the two seas, So praise be to freedom, To freedom be praise! == Notes == == References ==",
