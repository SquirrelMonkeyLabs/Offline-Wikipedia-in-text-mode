 "text": "Ingvar Cronhammar (17 December 1947 – 20 May 2021) was a sculptor from Sweden and Denmark known for his large, dark, and provocative works. == Life == Ingvar Cronhammar was born in Hässleholm in the south of Sweden. He moved to Denmark in 1965, where he studied at the Jutland Art Academy in Aarhus. His early works were influenced by American environmental art. They featured live chickens with lamps strapped to their backs and chairs covered with pigskin. As his career progressed, Cronhammar created larger works. Examples include The Gate, a steel machine representing death, and Elia (1989–2001), a massive steel sculpture that spews fire. His interest in machines also led him to create artworks using animal bones, bird wings, and skin. In his pieces, he combined elements from nature and human culture. Cronhammar made his sculptures from materials like mahogany, steel, and rubber. They can be found in museums and public spaces in Denmark. The Herning Museum of Contemporary Art has a big collection of his works. Ingvar Cronhammar died on May 20, 2021, at the age of 73. == Awards == In 1993, Cronhammar was awarded the Eckersberg Medal. In 2003, he was awarded Thorvaldsen Medal. He was decorated a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 2007. == References == Category:1947 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Swedish artists Category:20th-century artists Category:21st-century artists",
