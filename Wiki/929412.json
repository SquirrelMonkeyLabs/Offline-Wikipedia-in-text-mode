 "text": "The 1893 International Mathematical Congress was an event that came before the International Congress of Mathematicians. It took place from August 21 to August 26, 1893 in Chicago. It was held in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition. It is not considered part of the International Congress of Mathematicians because 41 of the 45 participants were from the United States. The mathematician Felix Klein brought articles by German, French, Austrian, Italian, and Swiss mathematicians for publication in the Proceedings of Congress. == Background == Felix Klein delivered the opening speech at the International Mathematical Congress. The speech was called \"The Present State of Mathematics\". It contained a \"manifesto\" for future international cooperation mathematicians. Klein was a strong believer in international collaboration in mathematics. Georg Cantor, whose efforts led to the founding of the German Mathematical Society, believed in the same. Their goals were the same, but they were both motivated by different personal reasons. Cantor felt that his close colleagues were unfairly criticizing his work, so he wanted a bigger platform to promote his ideas. Klein had strong ideas about math education and math research, and he was a great organizer who wanted to see his ideas on a bigger stage. == References == Category:1893 Category:History of mathematics",
