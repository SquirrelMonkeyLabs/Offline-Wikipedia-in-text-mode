The trilogy is composed of the following works: O País dos Mourões (1963), Peripécias de Gerardo (1972) e Rastro de Apolo (1977). Starting with a reflection on the death and survival of the epic genre, our argument goes on to associate Os Peãs with a tendency in modern poetry that uses the classical epic poem as a reference or a \"symbolic frame\" for modern poetic experiments dealing with the notions of tradition, memory and community.
