Different scientists disagree about whether this frog should be in the genus Litoria or Nyctimystes. This frog has red eyes and pads, called nuptial pads, on its front feet. Some scientists think that Nyctimystes dux is a separate species. Other scientists think it is the same species as Litoria graminea. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
