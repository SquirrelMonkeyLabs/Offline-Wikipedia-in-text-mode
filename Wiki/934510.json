 "text": "Proxima Centauri b is a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the Sun's closest stellar neighbor. The planet is in Proxima Centauri's habitable zone and is a terrestrial planet a bit bigger than Earth, so it could be an Earth-like planet with lakes, rivers an ocean and complex extraterrestrial life. The planet is 7.5 million kilometres on average from Proxima Centauri and is likely to either be tidally locked or have an orbital resonance similar to that of Mercury. The biggest potential strike against Proximal b's habitability is that its star is prone to flares. Category:Exoplanets Category:Terrestrial planets",
