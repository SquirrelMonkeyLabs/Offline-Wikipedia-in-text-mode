 "text": "An agglutinative language is a type of language where words are made up of different types of morphemes to determine their meaning. (A morpheme is the smallest part of a word that has a meaning.) What makes these languages different from others, is that if one removes the morphemes from the word, they will be able to stand on their own. == Examples == ===Chinook=== *a–č–i–m–l–ud–a: (future–he–him–thee–to–give–future): \"He will give it to you\" ===Hungarian=== *szent: holy *szentség: holiness *szentségtelen: holinessless ===Persian=== Bozorgtarinhashunra niga mikardam - I was looking at their biggest ones. *Bozorg: big *Bozorg-tar: bigger (lit. more big) *Bozorg-tar-in: biggest (lit. the more big one) *Bozorg-tar-in-ha: biggest ones (plural) *Bozorg-tar-in-ha-shun: their biggest ones *Bozorg-tar-in-ha-shun-ra: at their biggest ones ===Turkish=== *ev–ler–den: (home–plural–from): \"from the houses\" ===Kazakh=== *бару: (baru) — to go *бара алмау: (bara almau) — not being able to go *бара алмаған: (bara almağan) — the one that couldn't go *бара алмағандар: (bara almağamdar) — the ones that couldn't go == List == Below is a list of modern agglutinative languages: * Algonquian languages, namely Cree and Blackfoot * Athabaskan languages * Austronesian languages * Bantu languages (see Ganda) * Berber languages * Dravidian languages, most well- known of which are Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Tulu * Eskimo–Aleut languages, namely Aleut, Inuktitut, and Yupik * Esperanto * Igboid languages * Iranic languages, namely Persian, Ossetian * Japanese language * Kartvelian languages * Korean language * many Tibeto-Burman languages * many Uralic languages, namely Hungarian, Finnish and Sami languages * Mongolic languages * Muskogean languages * Northeast and Northwest Caucasian languages * Quechua languages and Aymara * Siouan languages, namely Lakota and Yuchi * some Mesoamerican and native North American languages including Nahuatl, Huastec, and Salish * Tungusic languages * Turkic languages * Vasconic languages namely Basque, and the extinct Aquitanian * Somali language == References == Category:Languages",
