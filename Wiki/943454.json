The death of the matador exactly reflects the state of mind of the toto raised in the air his neck twisted by pain, the blood gushing from his belly, the same suffering bull. Everything in this composition is dramatic, enhanced by the red that impresses the viewer, making him experience the suffering of the animal. The work has the very violent colors of red and black. It is even more poignant because the violence is suggested by the size of an immense bull, covered in blood. The violence and brutality of the bull's wiggling for life contrast with the pity and love that wants to generate the suffering of the bull towards the viewer. == Related pages == *Umberto Pettinicchio *Pablo Picasso == Bibliography == * [s.n.] (1983).
