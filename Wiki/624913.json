McCarthy's fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985), was on Time magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language books published since 1923. As of 1991, none of McCarthy's novels had sold more than 5,000 hardcover copies, and \"for most of his career, he did not even have an agent\". He was called the \"best unknown novelist in America\". For All the Pretty Horses (1992), he won both the U.S. National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award. His 2005 novel No Country for Old Men was made as a 2007 movie of the same name, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. In 2007, McCarthy won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.
