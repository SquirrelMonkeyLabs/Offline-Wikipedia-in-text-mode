 "text": "Blue raspberry is a common flavoring for candy, snacks, syrups and soft drinks. The flavor does not actually come from any type of raspberry; it's usually a mixture of compounds found in pineapples, cherries, and bananas.https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop- culture/article/what-is-blue-raspberry-flavor Blue raspberry food often contains a bright blue food coloring, the most common being Brilliant Blue FCF, although this coloring is not the color of the actual color of the fruit, which is almost black when ripe. The blue color also helps tell apart raspberry-flavored foods from cherry- and strawberry-flavored foods (cherry is usually colored red, and strawberry is also sometimes colored red but is often colored pink if the same product is also available in cherry ). == References == Category:Food ingredients",
