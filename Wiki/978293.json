 "text": "is a cyberpunk visual novel role-playing video game for the Sega Mega-CD that was made and released by Japanese company Compile. It is based on the pen and paper RPG Shadowrun by FASA. It was released on February 23, 1996 in Japan, and is the last Mega-CD/Sega CD game released anywhere. The game is based on a Japanese manga series. Unlike the other Shadowrun video games, which play in Seattle and surrounding areas, this game plays in Japan. There are no orcs and trolls because Japan exiles them. Like the original game, it uses six-sided dice rolls for a turn-based combatâ€”conflict resolution system. ==Reception== Famitsu scored the game a 24/40. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1996 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Sega CD games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Visual novels",
