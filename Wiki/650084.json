A report in November 2020 by the Secretariat of State found that Pope John Paul II was aware of allegations against McCarrick but did not believe them, and that Benedict XVI, in 2005, after learning of the allegations, wanted McCarrick quickly replaced. The report did not blame Pope Francis for the scandal. In August 2023, a judge said McCarrick was not fit to stand trial because it is believed McCarrick has dementia. ==Death== McCarrick died at a nursing home in Dittmer, Missouri from dementia-related problems on April 3, 2025 at the age of 94. == References == == Other websites == * Profile at Catholic-Hierarchy Category:1930 births Category:2025 deaths Category:American cardinals Category:Writers from Newark, New Jersey Category:Writers from New York City Category:Writers from Washington, D.C.
