 "text": "The Royal Society is a society for science and scientists.Full title: The Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge. It was founded in 1660 by Charles II. It is the oldest society of its kind still in existence. == History == A Royal Charter, on 15 July 1662, created \"The Royal Society of London\". Lord Brouncker was the first President, and Robert Hooke was Curator of Experiments. The reigning monarch has always been the patron of the Royal Society since its foundation. The motto of the Royal Society is Nullius in Verba (Latin: take nobody's word for it).The full quote from Horace - \"Nullius addictus judicare in verba magistri\" - expands into the gold standard of objectivity: \"Not compelled to swear to any master's words\". This shows the Society's commitment to establishing scientific truth through experiment rather than by quoting authority. Although this seems obvious today, the philosophical basis of the Royal Society differed from previous philosophies such as scholasticism, which established scientific truth based on deductive logic, concordance with divine providence and the citation of such ancient authorities as Aristotle. == Fellows == The members of the society are called Fellows of the Royal Society, and put the letters FRS after their names. There are usually about 1600 of them. They are elected by existing Fellows. All other posts, such as the Secretary and President, are also by election. == A selected list of presidents == * Sir Christopher Wren (1680–1682) * Samuel Pepys (1684–1686) * Charles Montagu (1695–1698) * The Lord Somers (1698–1703) * Sir Isaac Newton (1703–1727) * Joseph Banks (1778–1820) * Sir Humphry Davy (1820–1827) * Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex (1830–1838) * William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse (1848–1854) * Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker (1873–1878) * Thomas Henry Huxley (1883–1885) * George Gabriel Stokes (1885–1890) * William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1890–1895) * Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister (1895–1900) * Sir William Huggins (1900–1905) * John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh (1905–1908) * Sir Joseph John Thomson (1915–1920) * Sir Ernest Rutherford (1925–1930) * Sir William Henry Bragg (1935–1940) * Sir Henry Hallett Dale (1940–1945) * Howard Florey, Baron Florey (1960) * Sir Andrew Huxley (1980–1985) * Sir Aaron Klug (1995–2000) * Robert May, Baron May of Oxford (2000–2005) * Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow (2005–2010) * Sir Paul Nurse (2010–2015) Data from Royal Society website.The Royal Society website === Permanent staff === The Society's 15 Sections are administered by the permanent staff, led by the Executive Secretary, Stephen Cox CVO.
