The game was the sequel to WWE Raw which was released in 2002. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 9.1 out of 10 and said \"The new moves you get with the cage, cell, tables, ladders and chairs does take things a step beyond what the all-powerful No Mercy showed us. The gameplay and create-a-wrestler elements of the game are outstanding and make Raw 2 worth the price of admission for wrestling fans.‚Äù GameSpot gave the game a 6.9 out of 10 and stated \"WWE Raw 2 just doesn't feel like much of a step forward in the series. Instead it feels more like a big step sideways.\" ==References== Category:2003 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Professional wrestling video games Category:THQ games Category:Video games developed in Japan Raw 2 Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox-only games",
