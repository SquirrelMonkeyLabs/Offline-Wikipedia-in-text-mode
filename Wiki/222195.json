 "text": "Captain John Guy Dollman BA, FLS (1886-1942) (who was known as Guy Dollman) was a British zoologist and taxonomist. Dollman's Tree Mouse and Dollman's Vlei Rat are named after him. ==Life and work== Guy Dollman was the eldest son of the artist John Charles Dollman. He was born on 4 September 1886 and went to St Paul's School. He later went to St John's College Cambridge. In February 1907, when he was still a student, he was employed by the Department of Zoology at the British Museum (Natural History). He spent most of his working life there as Assistant Keeper of Mammals. In 1912, on an expedition to Vietnam, he discovered and named the Tonkin Snub-nosed Langur. He joined the British Army in 1915, and obtained a commission in the 19th London Regiment. He was injured in a bomb accident so he did not fight in the First World War. In 1919, he returned to the museum. He was an adviser to the British group at the 1933 International Conference for the Preservation of the Flora and Fauna of Africa. This was the most important meeting about protecting nature before the Second World War. Dollman helped to decide which animal species needed protecting. He travelled and wrote a lot with Walter Rothschild. Some of their writing included New mammals from Dutch New Guinea (which was published in 1932) and a book about tree kangaroos which was called The Genus Dendrolagus (which was published in 1936). He was also a very good artist, showing pictures at the Royal Academy. He also drew pictures for his own scientific writings. Dollman died on 21 March 1942 when he was 65 years old. ==Binomial authority== Dollman is the binomial authority (the first person to name a species) for the following animals: Bates's Shrew (1915) Black-headed Night Monkey (1909) Christy's Dormouse (1914) Country Mouse (with Thomas) (1909) Cosens's gerbil (1914) Dent's Shrew (1915) Diminutive Gerbil (1911) Dollman's Tree Mouse (1910) Fiery Spiny Mouse (1910) Flower's Shrew (1915) Fox's Shrew (1915) Giant Thicket Rat (1911) Great-tailed Triok (with Rothschild) (1932) Greater Hamster-Rat (1914) Heather Shrew (1915) Hun Shrew (1915) Kemp's Spiny Mouse (1911) Kemp's Thicket Rat (1911) Lorrain Dormouse (1910) MacMillan's Shrew (1915) Mauritanian Shrew (1915) Moonshine Shrew (1910) Nyiro Shrew (1915) Nigerian Shrew (1915) Percival's gerbil (1914) Percival's Spiny Mouse (1911) Pygmy Ringtail Possum (with Rothschild) (1932) Rudd's Mouse (1909) Sahelian Tiny Shrew (1915) Shaw Mayer's Brush Mouse (with Rothschild) (1932) Silent Dormouse (1912) Spurrell's Free-tailed Bat (1911) Tarella Shrew (1915) Tonkin Snub-nosed Langur (1912) Turbo Shrew (1910) Ugandan Lowland Shrew (1915) Ultimate Shrew (1915) Zaphir's Shrew (1915) * In 1912, Dollman classified Elephantulus rufescens dundasi, a subspecies of the Rufous Elephant Shrew; * In 1912, Dollman classified Rhynchocyon petersi adersi, a subspecies of the Black and Rufous Elephant Shrew; * In 1915, Dollman classified Crocidura olivieri zuleika, a subspecies of the African Giant Shrew; * In 1932, Rothschild and Dollman also classified Phascolosorex dorsalis brevicaudata, a subspecies of the Narrow-striped Marsupial Shrew. ==Articles and Books written by Dollman== * A History of British Mammals; Gerald Edwin Hamilton Barrett-Hamilton, Guy Dollman, Martin Alister Campbell Hinton, and Edward Adrian Wilson (1910) ASIN: B0014IP87W * A new Elephant Shrew from Zanzibar; The Annals and Magazine of Natural History, 8th Series, Vol. X, (1912) * On the African Shrews belonging to the Genus Crocidura; The Annals and Magazine of Natural History, 8th series (1915 & 1916). * Catalogue of the Selous Collection of Big Game in the British Museum (Natural History); Longmans, Green and Co., (1921) available online * Guide to the Specimens of the Horse Family (Equid√¶) Exhibited in the Department of Zoology, British Museum (Natural History), 2nd ed.; Lydekker, Richard & Dollman, Guy; published by order of the Trustees (1922) * Records of Big Game: With Their Distribution, Characteristics, Dimensions, Weights, and Horn & Tusk Measurements by Rowland Ward, John Guy Dollman, J.
