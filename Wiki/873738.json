 "text": "The purple-sided leaf frog (Calllimedusa baltea) is a frog that lives in Peru. Scientists have seen it between 1280 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in cloud forests. The female frog lays eggs in pools that dry up for part of the year. This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings cut down the forests to get wood, to dig good rocks out of the ground, to raise cows, to grow coca plants, and to grow food to eat. Scientists think some of this even happens in one of the protected parts where the frog lives, Reserva Comunal El Sira. In other places, the ground is too steep for human beings to cut the trees. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
