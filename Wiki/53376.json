Princess Ashe of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler of Nabradia had been married for a short time when the Archadian Empire invaded Dalmasca. A war started and Archadia took over Dalmasca in no time, for the small country of Dalmasca stood no chance against the massive Archadian Empire. While the war was going on, Prince Rasler died, leaving Princess Ashe alone. The king of Dalmasca, Ashe's father, decided to surrender to Archadia, clinging to dreams of peace. However, Archadia's ruler wanted him dead as soon as the treaty was signed. Knights from Dalmasca tried to rescue him, but one of the captain of the knights, Basch, was replaced by his twin brother, who then killed the king and the Vaan's older brother Reks. Basch's twin brother is a \"Judge\" who works for Archadia. The real Basch is accused of high treason and is supposedly killed. Princess Ashe went into hiding, and was deemed dead. Two years later, Vaan, sneaks into the royal palace. There was a banquet going on to celebrate the election of a new leader Vayne. Vaan meets the sky pirates Balthier and Fran in the palace as they were trying to steal the same thing he himself had taken. When Resistance forces broke into the palace, Vaan and his new friends had to hide in the sewers beneath the palace. While they were in the sewers, they met the leader of the Resistance - Amalia. Vaan, Balthier and Fran are then put in jail. In the jail, find Basch. They free Basch from the cage he is being held in and they escape back to Rabanastre, which is the capital of Dalmasca. There, they learn that Vaan's friend Penelo was kidnapped. The kidnapper is named Ba'Gamnan, and he has taken Penelo to Bhujerba, a city in the sky. Balthier lets Vaan use his airship (like a airplane in the shape of a ship) and fly to rescue Penelo. When they get to Bhujerba, they go to the Lhusu Mines, where they meet the brother of Vayne who rescues Penelo. Later, captured by the Empire, they are all reunited with Amelia, who is actually Princess Ashe. Ashe has a stone (the dawn shard) which shows she is royalty. This is taken by the Empire, forcing the party to seek out another way to prove her family, seeking out the dusk shard from the King's tomb. After leaving the tomb with the shard, they leave to get peace between the two nations. ==Reception== Metacritic, a review gatherer gave Final Fantasy XII \"universal acclaim\".
