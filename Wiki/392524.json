 "text": "Salvation history, especially in the context of Christian theology, is an approach to understand events as part of the working of God's will to save humans. These events begin with the Fall of Man at the beginning of history (Book of Genesis) and include the covenants between God and Noah, Abraham, and Moses, the establishment of King David's dynasty etc. These and others are seen as necessary preparations for the salvation (Christianity) of all by Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. == Related pages == * Resurrection * Judgment * Eschatology * Apocalypse * Salvation (Christianity) * Soteriology Category:Christian theology",
