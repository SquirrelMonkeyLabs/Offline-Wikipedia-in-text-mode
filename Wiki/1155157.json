 "text": "Planet Nine, also called Planet X, is a hypothetical planet orbiting beyond Neptune. This theory would explain the anomalies in the Kuiper Belt. Planet 9 could have a weight (mass) about 5 to 10 times the weight of Earth. Since this planet should orbit far away, it would take between 10000 to 20000 Earth years to orbit the Sun. The brightness (Magnitude) of Planet 9 could be around 21, which means that it is very dim. == Related pages == * Tyche (planet) * Solar System == References == # https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planet-x/ == Other websites == * https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/04/science/planet-nine- kuiper-belt-latest-evidence/index.html Category:Solar System planets",
