The 2015 election were issued by Governor General David Johnston on August 4. The election was one of the longest in Canadian history.Only the first two election campaigns after Confederation were longer: 81 days in 1867 and 96 days in 1872. In those early days voting was staggered across the country over a period of several months, necessarily extending the length of the campaigns. Since then, the longest campaign was 74 days, in 1926. (Canadian Press, \"Imminent federal election to be costliest, longest in recent Canadian history\". Toronto Sun, 29 July 2015) It was also the first time since the 1979 election that a Prime Minister attempted to remain in office into a fourth consecutive Parliament and the first time since the 1980 election that someone attempted to win a fourth term of any kind as Prime Minister. The Liberal Party, led by Justin Trudeau, won 184 seats, allowing it to form a majority government with Trudeau becoming the next Prime Minister. Trudeau was sworn in on November 4, 2015. ==Results== â†“ 184 99 44 10 1 Party Party Votes Votes Votes Seats 6,943,276 39.5% 20.6% 5,613,614 31.9% 7.7% 3,470,350 19.7% 10.9% 821,144 4.7% 1.2% 602,944 3.4% 0.5% ==Notes== ==References== Category:2015 in Canada Category:2015 elections in North America Category:October 2015 events 2015 Category:Canadian federal elections",
