 "text": "The Pax airship disaster happened on May 12, 1902, in Paris. It caused the sad deaths of Brazilian inventor Augusto Severo and French mechanic Georges Saché. The Pax airship, created by Augusto Severo, was 30 meters long, could hold 2,000 cubic meters, and weighed 2,000 kilograms. Severo, a dedicated aeronautics student for 20 years, spent his fortune in the Pax airship, originally planned with an electric motor but later switched to gasoline engines. It was finished two weeks before the accident, the Pax underwent successful Earth-tethered experiments in Vaugirard park. Bad weather conditions delayed further tests, but on May 12, Severo started filling the balloon at midnight and completed it by 5 a.m. Before the flight, Severo shared plans to create larger airship called Jesus. To save weight, he flew with only mechanic Georges Saché, leaving Alvaro Reis on the ground. Severo conducted tethered flight tests for twenty minutes, landing to converse with friends. At 5:25 a.m., he resumed the flight without tethering. Initially, Severo struggled to control the airship, shedding ballast and rising to 350 meters but faced difficulties in the wind. Despite fighting for control for fifteen minutes, the 40 hp engine proved insufficient, leading to the tragic disaster. == History == The Pax airship blew up at 5:40 a.m. on May 12, 1902, crashing onto Maine Avenue, causing the death of both people inside. Fire suddenly came out from the engine, engulfing the entire aircraft. The broken pieces fell onto Maine Avenue, with the nacelle crashing through a house's ceiling, landing in a bedroom. Fortunately, the people's bed was on the other side, saving their lives. Experts had different opinions about the cause. Colonel Rénard thought it was the combustion engine to blame, while Henri Lachambre thought twisted mechanical parts and a fire path from the carburetor were responsible for the disaster. Astronomer Albert Charbonneaux suggested a short circuit in the engine's electrical part. Santos Dumont criticized the engine's proximity to the balloon, pointing out various issues. Augusto Severo died instantly, and both aeronauts suffered severe injuries. Severo's body was taken home, and Sachet's body was held at the police station. Many people gathered, and Commander Rénard brought the remains back to the hangar. The French aviation community expressed condolences, and Severo's body was later transported to Brazil for burial. The hangar in Paris changed ownership. == References == Category:20th century in Paris Category:Accidents",
