Features of her program included a 5-minute \"mini mix\". That was where a guest DJ submits a short remix. That featured many songs in a short time period, and the \"12 inches of 12\"s\" competition where people can win a cubic foot of vinyl records. ==Other websites== *BBC Radio 1: Annie Mac Category:1978 births Category:DJs Category:Musicians from Dublin Category:Living people",
