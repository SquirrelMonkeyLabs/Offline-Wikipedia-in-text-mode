 "text": "The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is an international organisation that represents chemists in individual countries. It governs everything to do with chemicals, elements and new discoveries. Every chemical known has a common name and a IUPAC name. This is also true for the Periodic Table of the Elements. Every element's name has been approved by IUPAC. This rule does not apply to those elements still given temporary names. The organisation was founded in 1919. == Other websites == * * IUPAC -Citizendium Category:Chemistry Category:Scientific organizations",
