 "text": "Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad (born June 28, 1973) is a Norwegian extreme drummer. He is better known by his stage name, Frost. He chose this stage name, because he wanted to purify himself and become one with the darkness and the Frost of Black Metal. He currently plays for the black metal bands Satyricon and 1349. He is considered reputable for being one of the fastest and most proficient drummer alive, and a legend to Black Metal and to Norway art scene. He has also took part as a drummer with the bands Gorgoroth, Zyklon-B, Gehenna and Keep of Kalessin. He first joined Satyricon temporarily to record the band second demo \"The Forest is My Throne\" (split album form Satyricon and Enslaved from the year 1993 - \"Black Winds\" and \"Min hyllest til vinterland\" are the two other song of the 3 songs demo album), but that changed in the next release, the first studio album Dark Medival Times (1994), where he was promoted to a permanent member. He used blast beats during his performances with 1349 and Satyricon. He has since done more simplistic and mid-tempo with Satyricon. During a tour, he was denied entry to North America by the US Department of Homeland Security. This was because he did not note that he was sentenced to 5 months for assault, for a bar fight in the early 1990s, when he was applying for his work visa. On the 1349 tours before 2008, Tony Laureano replaced him on drums. Joey Jordison and Trym Torson also performed with Satyricon during the bands North American tour dates. Frost was later able to join the band and perform again in the United States. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Heavy metal musicians Category:Living people Category:Norwegian musicians Category:Rock drummers",
