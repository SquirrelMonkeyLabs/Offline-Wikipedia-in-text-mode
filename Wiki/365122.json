 "text": "Pegomastax (\"strong jaw\") is a genus of small heterodontosaur dinosaur discovered in Lower Jurassic rocks in South Africa. It is based on a skull in the Iziko South African Museum in Cape Town. It was collected during a 1966â€“1967 expedition but not named and described until recently. Paul Sereno, who had recognized it as unusual in the 1980s, published a description in 2012. The type species is P. africana. Pegomastax differed from other heterodontosaurs by details of the skull. The lower jaw was robust, with a short beak. Like most other heterodontosaurs, Pegomastax had an enlarged canine-like tooth at the beginning of the lower jaw's tooth row, which may have been used for defence. The rest of its teeth were those of a herbivore.BBC News: Science & Environment. \"Dwarf 'vampire' dinosaur was a plant eater.\" ==References== Category:Dinosaurs of Africa Category:Heterodontosaurs Category:Jurassic dinosaurs",
