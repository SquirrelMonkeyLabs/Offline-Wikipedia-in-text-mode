 "text": "Mullett Arena is a multi-use arena located at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. The arena serves as the home for the Arizona State Sun Devils. The arena is used for men's and women's ice hockey, women's gymnastics, women's volleyball, and men's wrestling. From 2022 until 2024, the arena was the home arena for the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL). They first started to build the stadium in January 2021. The arena opened on October 12, 2022 and the first event was the Sun Devils' Maroon and Gold Exhibition game. The Coyotes had their first game in the arena on October 28, 2022. In their first game, they were defeated by the Winnipeg Jets 3–2 in overtime in front of a sellout crowd. The arena is named after both Donald and Barbara Mullett, who are two of the university's benefactors. After their lease ended at Gila River Arena, the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL) were in talks with Arizona State University to play at Mullett Arena. On February 10, 2022, a three-year deal was signed by the Arizona Coyotes to play their home games at Mullett Arena. On April 17, 2024, the Coyotes played both their last game in Mullett Arena and their last game as a franchise. They defeated the Edmonton Oilers 5–2 and Sean Durzi scored the last goal. The team was suspended, and its players and staff were moved to an expansion team in Salt Lake City in 2024. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Arizona State University Category:Arizona Coyotes Category:Buildings and structures in Arizona",
