 "text": "Tyrol (German: Tirol, Italian: Tirolo, Ladin: Tirol) is a (historical) region in the Alps. It is the very northern part of Italy and a western part of Austria. It borders to the Italian region of Lombardy, the Swiss canton of Graubünden and the Austrian state of Vorarlberg in the west, the German state of Bavaria in the north, the Austrian states of Salzburg and Carinthia in the east, and the Italian region of Veneto in the south. The region of Tyrol is similar to the former County of Tyrol. This county was part of Austria-Hungary till 1919. After World War I it was divided between Austria (North Tyrol) and Italy (South Tyrol). Nowadays these expressions have different meanings (see below). It is split up into: A. Tyrol (state) (a state of Austria): * East Tyrol (Osttirol) * North Tyrol (Nordtirol) B. Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (a region of Italy): * Province of Bolzano-Bozen (Provincia autonoma di Bolzano - Alto Adige / Autonome Provinz Bozen – Südtirol) or South Tyrol (Südtirol / Sudtirolo) or Alto Adige * Province of Trento (Provincia autonoma di Trento) or Trentino Since 1996 the region of Tyrol has been a Euroregion, called Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino Euroregion (German: Europaregion Tirol-Südtirol- Trentino, Italian: Euregio Tirolo-Alto Adige-Trentino). The region of Tyrol is also divided into three languages. In East and North Tyrol German is spoken. South Tyrol is primarily German with a little Italian and Ladin, Trentino is primarily Italian with a little German and Ladin. The region of Tyrol is a very mountainous area. It belongs to three ranges of the Eastern Alps. A great part of the Southern Limestone Alps (among them the Dolomites) and also a southern part of the Central Eastern Alps cover the Italian part of Tyrol, whereas the middle of the Central Eastern Alps and a great part of the Northern Limestone Alps (among them the southern Allgäu Alps) cover the Austrian part of Tyrol. Several well-known geographical locations lie in Tyrol. For example the Brenner Pass, a mountain pass on the border of Austria and Italy, Lake Garda, the biggest lake of Italy and partially in Tyrol, and various places, in the state of Tyrol: Innsbruck (its capital) and Lienz, and in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol: Trento (its capital), Bolzano / Bozen and Merano. == Other websites == * Website of Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino Euroregion Ortler Reschensee.JPG|Mount Ortler (3,905 m) in South Tyrol is the highest mountain of Tyrol Drei Zinnen-Tre Cime Di Lavaredo 1.JPG|The peaks of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo or Drei Zinnen in the Dolomites (South Tyrol-Veneto) Steinschartenkopf from Bockkarkopf.jpg|A mount of the Allgäu Alps in North Tyrol (Steinschartenkopf) Pleisenspitze2.jpg|The Pleisenspitze (2,569 m) in the Karwendel Alps (North Tyrol) Törleskogl und Schildkogel mit Wildensee vom Wildenkogelweg a.JPG|The Törleskogl (2,710 m) in the Venediger Group Alps (East Tyrol) Crozzon di Brenta 2.jpg|The Crozzon di Brenta (3,135 m) in the Dolomites (Trentino) Zillertal3.jpg|Ski piste on the Hintertux Glacier in North Tyrol Brennerpass from north.JPG|The Brenner Pass from the north side Bolzano 1-50 (9710380986).jpg|Vineyard near Bolzano Benacus creino.jpg|Lake Garda near Nago-Torbole in Trentino Lienz gesamt.jpg|View at Lienz, a town in East Tyrol Innsbruck NW.JPG|Bird's eye view of the city of Innsbruck Tirol Schloss 01.jpg|Tyrol Castle near Merano in South Tyrol Council of Trent.JPG|Council of Trent, held in Trento Andreas hofer mit hut.jpg|Andreas Hofer (born 1767 - executed 1810), leader of the Tyrolean Rebellion against the Napoleonic invasion Category:Alps",
