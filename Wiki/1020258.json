 "text": "The Geneva Conference (French: Accords de Gen√®ve) was a conference held in Geneva, Switzerland. It discussed the two major wars in Asia at the time: the Korean War and the First Indochina War. In Korea, the conference results in the establishment of Korean Demilitarized Zone around the 48th Parallel with some slight changes and the signing of an Korean Armistice Agreement, between North and South Korea. In Indochina, however, it causes chaos as the State of Vietnam becomes Republic of Vietnam, Democratic Republic of Vietnam gains recognition, independence of the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, temporary division of Vietnam along the 17th Parallel until 1956, when general elections supervised by the UN, India, Poland and Canada are organized, withdrawal of South Vietnam and the United States from the peace plan, causing the start of the Second Indochina War, communist insurgencies in the South of the Vietnamese DMZ, and neighboring countries (Laos, Cambodia and Thailand), Operation Passage to Freedom happens where Vietnamese citizens are given 300 days to choose the north or the south to live in. The vast majority of Vietnamese flee southwards towards the capitalist South to escape the harsh atheist rule of the Communists in the north. == Related pages == * History of South Korea * History of Vietnam * French Indochina * North Korea * Korean Peninsula * Vietnam * Vietnam War * Korean Demilitarized Zone * Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone ==Other websites== *https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/inch005.asp (to know more about the final declaration) https://www.britannica.com/event/Geneva-Accords (to know more about the Geneva accords) Category:Korean War",
