 "text": "Wikimedia UK (WMUK) is a charity that helps people who work on Wikimedia projects in the United Kingdom. It is a Wikimedia chapter owned by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimedia UK started out as Wiki Educational Resources Limited. However, because of money problems they became Wiki UK Limited. They failed to get charitable status at first. As a result, the group made changes to what it did so it could become a charity. The group has worked with museums and others. They have organised things for volunteers in the United Kingdom to do. Some of the organisation's board members have been in controversies because of what they've done on Wikipedia. There were claims that a Wikimedia UK staff member was promoting Gibraltarpedia. == References == Category:Wikimedia Foundation Category:Charities of the United Kingdom",
