 "text": "Skyros is an island of the east coast of Greece. It is the southernmost island of the Sporades, an archipelago in the Aegean Sea. Around the 2nd millennium BC and slightly later, the island was known as \"The Island of the Magnetes\". Later it was called \"Pelasgia\" and \"Dolopia\". Finally it got the name Skyros. At it is the largest of the Sporades. The island has a population of about 3,000 (in 2011). The Hellenic Air Force has a major base in Skyros, because of the island's strategic location in the middle of the Aegean. It is a popular tourist location. Skyros is the resting place of Rupert Brooke, the British poet. In Skyros lives a small horse whose height is about 90 to 110 centimeters. This horse is a rare breed and does not exist anywhere else in the world. This fact makes it a valuable animal species and is of great scientific interest. It is a petite and fine-boned animal. His head is somewhat thick, but with large intelligent eyes and large nostrils. The neck is very strong and thick in proportion to the shoulder blades and sternum, which are narrow and sharp. The head looks like a single piece, with the very muscular neck, thick and triangular where it meets the head. His mane is long and rich with a color always darker than the skin and mixed with silver hairs. == References == Category:Islands of Greece",
