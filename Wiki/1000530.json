 "text": "Pay Related Social Insurance is part of the tax system in the Republic of Ireland. People over 16 years of age and under 66 have to pay. It is quite like the British National Insurance system. There are different rates for different sorts of workers. Some of the money is used to pay for healthcare, but people do not have to show they have paid to get treatment. Each week's payment earns the worker a \"credit\" or \"contribution\", which gives them a right to non-means-tested welfare payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit and the State Pension. These payments are the same for everyone, not linked to their earnings. ==References== Category:Health in the Republic of Ireland Category:Social security Category:Taxation in the Republic of Ireland",
