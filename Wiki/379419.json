 "text": "Charles Robert Alexandre des Moulins (1798-1875) was a French botanist who also studied molluscs. In 1830, he proposed to introduce plants into aquaria so that the animals in the aquarium could breathe better. He described many species of snails, for example Pagodulina pagodula, and plants, for example Euphorbia milii. Towards the end of his life he became opposed to Darwinism.
