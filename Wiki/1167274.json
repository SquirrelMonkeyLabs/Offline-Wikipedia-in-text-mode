 "text": "The fast singer frog (Allobates velocicantus) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Home== Scientists saw the frog in forest that had never been cut down and forest that was growing back. They found it near streams. They saw it between 181 and 211 meters above sea level. The frog lives in a protected place Área De Relevante Interesse Ecológico Japiim Pentecoste. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on small, woody plant leaves. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the frogs to water. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists found the frog in two places, and one of them is protected. But people cut down too many trees in both places to get wood to build with and make room for farms and places for cows to eat grass, even where this is against the law. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
