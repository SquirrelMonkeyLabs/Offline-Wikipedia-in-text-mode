 "text": "Malatya is a big city in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. It is the capital of Malatya Province. The city has been a human settlement for thousands of years. The name \"Malatya\" might come from the Hittite word \"melid\" or \"milit,\" which means \"honey.\" The city has been known by different names over time, like \"Malidiya\" in Hittite and \"Meliddu\" in Akkadian. The ancient Greek historian Strabo said that the city was called \"Melitene\" in ancient times. The Romans used this name after they expanded into the east. Strabo also said that the people of Melitene shared the same language and culture with people from nearby areas like Cappadocia and Cataonia. The ancient city of Melitene was located a few kilometers away from the modern city, in the village of Arslantepe near Battalgazi. Battalgazi, which was called \"Eskimalatya\" (Old Malatya), used to be the center of the city until the 19th century, when the city moved to its current location. Malatya is famous for its apricots. About 80% of Turkey's apricot production comes from Malatya, which is called \"kayısı diyarı\" (apricot land). In February 2023, the city was severely damaged as a result of the Turkey–Syria earthquake. == References == Category:Cities in Turkey Category:Eastern Anatolia Region",
