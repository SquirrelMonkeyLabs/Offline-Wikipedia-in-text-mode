 "text": "In introductory chemistry, the reactivity series or activity series is an empirical series of metals, in order of chemical reactivity from highest to lowest. It is used to summarize information about the chemical reactions of metals with acids and water, single displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores. The elements at a higher level are more reactive, whereas the elements at a lower level are less reactive. The reactivity series reads as follows, starting at the most reactive, going down to the least reactive: *Cobalt Co *Nickel Ni *Tin Sn *Lead Pb *Hydrogen H *Antimony Sb *Bismuth Bi *Copper Cu *Tungsten W *Mercury Hg *Silver Ag *Gold Au *Platinum Pt h Category:Chemistry",
