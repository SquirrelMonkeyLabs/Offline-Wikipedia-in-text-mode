 "text": "The bamboo moss frog, Smith's Asian frog, smooth bug-eyed frog, or Smith's Asian tree frog (Theloderma laeve) is a frog. It lives in southern Vietnam. Scientists think it may live in Cambodia and Laos too. These frogs live in tropical forests. People have seen them on bamboo plants and rattan palm plants and in places that human beings have changed. People have seen this frog between 125 and 1400 meters above sea level. These frogs lay eggs in May. The male frogs call to the female frogs. The animal hatches out of its egg as a tadpole. It swims in streams. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. It may be in some danger from human beings cutting down forests to build farms, especially for plants to sell, for example coffee, rubber, and tea. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Bidoup Nui Ba National Park, Bu Gia Map National Park, Bach Ma National Park, Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve, Ea So Nature Reserve, and Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
