 "text": "The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (or Politburo, ; abbreviated: ) was the highest policy-making authority within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. What happened at Politburo meetings remained a mystery until Soviet newspapers, in 1982, began to publish summaries of the sesÂ­sions. It was founded in October 1917, and refounded in March 1919, at the 8th Congress of the Bolshevik Party. It was known as the Presidium from 1952 to 1966. The Politburo ended in 1991 when the Soviet Union broke-up. ==References== Category:Organizations based in the Soviet Union",
