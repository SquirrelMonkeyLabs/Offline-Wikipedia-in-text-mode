 "text": "In Video games, an Easter egg is a secret for players to find. It may be possible for players to find them playing the game, or they may have to go into the files or hack/modify the game to see them. The term is sometimes used for other media types as well. They are named after Easter eggs, which are hidden for children to find. ==Examples== *In DOOM 2, the final boss is actually a picture of developer John Romero’s head hidden behind the face of the “real” boss. *In Portal and Portal 2, players can find hints and messages left by the character Doug Ratmann. *In Undertale, references to the character W.D. Gaster can only be discovered through a randomly selected variable known as a \"fun value.\" *In The Stanley Parable, the player can hop out a window into a white void outside the level bounds. After they do this the narrator will tell them it’s actually an easter egg. Category:Video game terminology",
