 "text": "Francisco Rabaneda Cuervo (18 February 1934 â€“ 3 February 2023), better known as Paco Rabanne, was a Spanish fashion designer. == Early life == At the age of five, he and his mother, a head seamstress at Balenciaga, escaped the Spanish Civil War by fleeing to France. There, he assumed the name Paco Rabanne. By the early 1960s, after training as an architect, he applied his skills towards avant-garde accessory design, proposing unique creations for several haute couture houses. == Career == He became notorious in the 1960s for creating bizarre yet influential garments made of unusual, nonwoven materials such as plastic and aluminum. He left the fashion scene in 1999 to devote himself to other activities. His success was not only limited to clothing and costume design, in 1969 he had a smash hit with the metallic 'It' bag, a simple square envelope with a shoulder strap. In 1999, he announced that at the age of seventeen he had visions of Parisians in flames throwing themselves into the Seine and that after studying other concordant prophecies, he came to the conclusion that the Mir space station was going to crash in France at the time of the solar eclipse of August 11, 1999. == References == ==Other websites== * * Category:French fashion designers Category:Spanish fashion designers Category:1934 births Category:2023 deaths",
