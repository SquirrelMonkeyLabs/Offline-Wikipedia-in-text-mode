It is based in Parliament House, Edinburgh, and serves as both a court of first instance and a court of appeal. Together with the High Court of Justiciary (Scotland’s supreme criminal court), it forms part of the College of Justice established in 1532.http://legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/18 == History == The Court of Session was established by the College of Justice Act 1532 during the reign of King James V of Scotland. It was modeled on European courts of the time, with influence from France and other civil law systems. Initially, the court included clerical members, but over time, it evolved into a professional judiciary dominated by legal experts. Parliament House in Edinburgh has been the court's home since 1639, making it one of the oldest courts in continuous operation in the world. == Related pages == * Scots law * High Court of Justiciary * Supreme Court of the United Kingdom == References == == Other websites == * Official website of the Court of Session * Court of Session- related legislation at legislation.gov.uk Category:Courts of Scotland",
