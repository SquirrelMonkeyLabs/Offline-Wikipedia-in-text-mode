Psychedelic rock, also called psychedelia, is a style of rock music that materialized in the late 1960s that was influenced by the experience of taking hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD. Psychedelic rock incorporated elements of blues and folk rock and eventually contributed to the evolution of hard rock and progressive rock. It was partly inspired by Garage rock, British pop, bubblegum music and new hippie and Eastern ideas.
