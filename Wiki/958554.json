 "text": "The Gang of Four Messing up Hong Kong(traditional Chinese: 亂港四人幫) was first used by Sing Pao Daily News in August 2016 to call these four men as a group – Zhang Xiaoming, Leung Chun-ying, Jiang Zaizhong and Tung Chee Hwa. Sing Pao Daily News kept writing for months that the group had been causing trouble in Hong Kong for their own gain. Leung sounded like he looked down on the above- said writing when he once answered reporters' questions. Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, whose boss is Jiang, kept writing for months that the above-said writing was telling lies. Many people cared about their writing bad things about each other. They had different guesses on why it was happening. In February 2017, Sing Pao Daily News said that some people had begun doing horrible things to try to make them stop writing about 'the Gang of Four Messing up Hong Kong'. == Reference == Category:2010s in Hong Kong Category:Politics of the People's Republic of China",
