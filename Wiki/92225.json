This is because there are big local deposits of china clay (kaolin) and potter's clay (potter's earth). Meißen porcelain was the first high quality porcelain to be produced outside of China. The first European porcelain was made in Meißen in 1710, when the Royal Porcelain Factory was opened in the Albrechtsburg. In 1861, it was moved to the Triebisch valley of Meißen, where the Meißen porcelain factory can still be found today. == Notable residents == * St. Benno (1010-1106), Bishop of Meißen * Heinrich Frauenlob (died 1318), poet * Johann Klaj (1616-1656), poet * Johann Elias Schlegel (1719-1749), critic and poet * Johann Adolf Schlegel (1721-1793), poet and clergyman * Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), physician * Karl G.
