 "text": "Euripides (c. 480 BCâ€“406 BC) was an Ancient Greek writer from Athens who wrote about 90 plays. Only 18 of his tragedies have survived complete, more than all other surviving ancient Greek tragedies put together. A nineteenth play, Rhesus is sometimes thought to be by Euripides, but not all classicists agree on this. Euripides was the last of the three greatest Ancient Greek writers of tragedies, the others being Aeschylus and Sophocles. == Surviving plays == *Alcestis (439 BC, second prize) *Medea (431 BC, third prize) *Heracleidae (c. 430 BC) *Hippolytus (428 BC, first prize) *Andromache (c. 425 BC) *Hecuba (c. 424 BC) *The Suppliants (c. 423 BC) *Electra (c. 420 BC) *Heracles (c. 416 BC) *Trojan Women (415 BC, second prize) *Iphigeneia in Tauris (c. 414 BC) *Ion (c. 414 BC) *Helen (412 BC) *Phoenician Women (c. 410 BC) *Orestes (408 BC) *Bacchae and Iphigeneia at Aulis (405 BC, posthumous) *Cyclops (408 BC) == Related pages == *Theatre of Ancient Greece Category:Ancient Greek writers Category:480s BC births Category:406 BC deaths",
