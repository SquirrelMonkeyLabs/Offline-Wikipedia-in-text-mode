In 2005 he had been a defense witness for Jackson's child molestation trial. In June 2014 there will be a hearing where it is decided whether Robson can sue Jackson's estate over the abuse. In November 2013, Billboard magazine's issue, 44 did a cover with Michael on it. It said 'Life After Death'. Inside the magazine there was an article about the success of Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour. In January 2014, a judge ruled that Jackson's family could not have another trial against AEG Live. Xscape was released on May 9, 2014. ==Voice== Jackson had a unique voice. Between 1971 and 1975, it changed from boy soprano to spinto tenor. Jackson had a three and a half octave vocal range. He is the best-known musician to use the 'vocal hiccup'. He first used it in 1973 on It's Too Late to Change the Time on The Jackson 5's G.I.T.: Get It Together album. Jackson also sang 'come on' wrongly on purpose so that it sounded like 'shamone'. ==Personal life== Jackson lived a well-publicized personal life, even though he tried to stay private. He was often in celebrity and tabloid magazines. Later in his life, he was in magazines because of his personal life more than for his music. ===Marriages and children=== In 1994, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of rock musician Elvis Presley. He divorced her in 1995 and married nurse Debbie Rowe in 1996. Three months after Rowe and Jackson's marriage she gave birth to a son, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. The next year she gave birth to a daughter, Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson. The couple divorced in April 2000. Prince Michael II was born on February 21, 2002. Jackson never said who the mother was. He is better known as Blanket. When Blanket was 8 months old, Jackson held him over a balcony with a towel over Blanket's head. At the time, people did not know that he was called Blanket. Jackson made a public apology after people got upset. After Jackson died, his mother Katherine was made the guardian of his children. In August 2012, Jackson's nephew TJ was made the children's co- guardian. ===Bubbles=== In the 1980s, Jackson bought a chimpanzee from a Texas research facility. He named it Bubbles and used it for a pet. Bubbles frequently traveled with Jackson, who had a strong attachment to the animal. The chimp, for example, was permitted to use Jackson's personal toilet. As a result, people started to see Jackson as an eccentric. The media mocked Jackson and called him \"Wacko Jacko,\" which he hated. Media coverage often focused on Bubbles, rather than on Jackson's music, and many false stories about the animal were told. One such story claimed that Bubbles was not a single ape, but one of several.Taraborrelli, p. 364Taraborrelli, p. 380 === Claims of sexual abuse === In 1993, he was accused of child molestation, but there was no trial; the case was settled out of court. In 2003, he was accused a second time of child molestation. In a TV documentary called Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson held hands with a 12-year-old boy called Gavin Arvizo and said that he shared his bed with children. When he was 13, Gavin Arvizo accused Jackson of sexually abusing him. This time Jackson was tried in court, and in 2005 he was found not guilty of fourteen criminal charges. In May 2013, on the Today show, a dancer called Wade Robson alleged that Jackson sexually abused him for 7 years. Prior to this, Robson had vehemently defended Jackson, including twice under oath. == Appearance and health == === Hair === Over the years, Jackson's face and skin color changed. This attracted a lot of attention. However, when he was filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984, Jackson got second-degree burns to his scalp. These were extremely painful, and Jackson started taking painkillers. In his later years Jackson always wore a hairpiece or wig that blended with his natural hair. His autopsy found that his scalp was tattooed black so that it blended in with his wigs. === Face === Jackson's face appeared to go through major changes during his career. People especially talked about Jackson's nose. Jackson had an immune condition called discoid lupus. According to Dr. Richard Strick, Jackson had an immune condition called discoid lupus that \"destroyed part of the skin of his nose\". Jackson denied having plastic surgery to his face on more than a few occasions. When people pointed out that his face changed, he said that puberty, weight loss and his vegetarian diet were at fault.Jackson, pp. 229â€“230 But the change was so drastic that few people believed him. Jackson's autopsy found that his lips were tattooed pink. === Skin color === Jackson's skin color varied a lot during the course of his career. It seemed to get lighter over time. People accused Jackson of wanting lighter skin and bleaching his skin to make it that way. In truth, Jackson had vitiligo, a rare skin condition that creates light spots on the skin. (The skin around these spots keep their normal color.) Large areas of Jackson's body were very pale. He used makeup and medication to try to make his skin color look the same all over his body. This made it look like his skin tone was getting lighter. Jackson first revealed that he had vitiligo in a 1993 television interview with Oprah Winfrey. Later, his autopsy confirmed that Jackson did have vitiligo, with large sections of white or lightened skin on his body. It also noted that Jackson used a skin-bleaching cream called Benoquin to treat his vitiligo. === Substance abuse === Jackson was allegedly addicted to prescription drugs. In fact, he died of a drug overdose. In 2009 his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, gave him intravenous Propofol for his insomnia. The insomnia was actually a side effect of Jackson's addiction to Demerol. While Murray was out of the room, Jackson's heart stopped and he died. Jackson had many physicians (including Dr. Murray) who supplied him with medications, including controlled substances like Demerol. === Mental health and trauma === Michael's father, Joe Jackson, abused him physically and emotionally during rehearsals. When he found out his son was self-conscious about his appearance, his father called him \"big-nose.\" Some people have suggested that Jackson had body dysmorphic disorder. As a teenager, he had acne. In Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson told Martin Bashir how he went home and cried after a woman called him ugly because of his acne.Shaw, Julie (Director). (2003) Living with Michael Jackson: A Tonight Special. Granada Television. The disorder is often triggered by appearance-related bullying. Some people think that Jackson had anorexia nervosa. In 1984, Jackson weighed 105 pounds. He was 5\"9 tall. This would have made his BMI 15.5, which is very underweight.Taraborrelli, pp. 312â€“313 He weighed 112 lbs. when he died. This is in the unhealthy range. === Physical health === Jackson may have had a rare genetic disease called Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, according to a biographer called Ian Halperin. Halpern wrote that Jackson's genetic disease had caused him to lose 95% of the vision in his left eye. In fact, Jackson's doctor Conrad Murray said that he thought Jackson was \"legally blind\" and had phlebitis.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/jury-hears-of-jacksons- catalogue-of-illnesses-toenail-fungus-and-urination- problems/story-e6frg6so-1226164624139 === Controversies === Aspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. He was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993, but the case was settled out of court. In 2003, Jackson was charged with child sexual abuse by Gavin Arvizo. In 2005, Jackson was found not guilty of all charges. == Death == On June 25, 2009, Jackson was found without a heartbeat and taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. He had been unresponsive since 12:15. He arrived at the hospital with no signs of life. Though he was not pronounced dead when he arrived at the hospital, by 1pm he had already died. His death was announced that day at 2:25pm, and confirmed by the Los Angeles coroner at 4:30pm. Jackson died just two months before his 51st birthday. The news of his death spread around the world very quickly. People around the world grieved on a scale never seen before. Rumors and news items about Jackson's death broke records for web traffic. Jackson's death gave Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Yahoo the most page views they had ever encountered. This enormous amount of Internet traffic caused a cyberspace traffic jam. === Dr. Murray === Jackson's doctor Conrad Murray, who supplied the Propofol, claimed Jackson took the overdose himself. However, the Coroner ruled the death was a homicide. Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter and served four years in prison. Propofol is used as anesthesia for major surgeries and requires heavy monitoring, including nurses and medical equipment. Conrad Murray admitted to police that he had none of these when he gave Jackson the Propofol. His autopsy discussed how dangerous Murray's actions were. It also noted that Jackson had an increased risk of respiratory failure because he had a lung injury. === Memorial service === A two-hour memorial service was held at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. It began with Smokey Robinson reading comments by Nelson Mandela, Diana Ross and other close friends of Jackson's who could not attend the memorial. Mariah Carey sang \"I'll Be There\" at the memorial service, followed by a speech given by Queen Latifah. Lionel Richie performed \"Jesus is Love\". Berry Gordy, Motown founder, spoke next, offering condolences. Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson also spoke, with Magic describing the event as a \"celebration of Jackson's life and works\" rather than a funeral. Jennifer Hudson sang \"Will You Be There\" accompanied by a music video. Reverend Al Sharpton then gave a speech about how Jackson kept rising and \"never stopped\". John Mayer played the guitar as he did in Michael Jackson's song Human Nature. This was followed by Brooke Shields speaking. Jermaine Jackson, Jackson's older brother, then performed Smile, Michael's favorite song written by comic drama legend Charlie Chaplin. Next to speak were Martin Luther King III and Bernice King. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee followed them, claiming \"people are innocent until proven guilty.\" (This was a reminder to people who accused Jackson of unproven child molestations). She also said that Jackson's humanitarian efforts should be praised. Usher then sang \"Gone Too Soon\", followed by a montage of old videos of Jackson himself. Shamim sang next, with Kenny Ortega introducing him afterward. Kenny Ortega explained that Michael Jackson saw the Staples Center as his home, which is why the funeral service was held there. Ortega then sang a tribute to Jackson, including \"We Are the World\" and \"Heal the World\". The service ended with speeches by members of Michael's family, including Jermaine, Marlon and daughter Paris. Paris began to cry and said that \"Daddy was the best father anyone could have.\" She added \"I will miss him\" before leaving the microphone and turning into Janet Jackson's arms. ===Burial=== At first, Michael Jackson's custom-made quarter-million dollar golden casket, nicknamed \"The Promethean,\" was not expected to appear at the memorial service. However, due to a change in the family's plans, the casket did appear. Viewing parties were held all over the world for the broadcast. Movie theaters showed the memorial service in Times Square, the Apollo Theater, Raleigh, and Berlin. The broadcast was replayed a few times the next day. An estimated 1 billion people tuned into the farewell concert. Over 3,000 police officers were assigned to the event, the largest amount assigned to a single event since the 1984 Summer Olympics. It cost the City of Los Angeles 1.4 million dollars. Jackson's funeral took place nine weeks after he died, in Glendale, California on September 3, 2009. He was laid to rest at 9:45 pm in the mausoleum, above the ground. Some family members had wanted him to be buried below ground in the mausoleum, while Jermaine Jackson wanted him buried on Neverland ranch. However, Michael's mother Katherine made the final decision. == Legacy == Through music videos and live performances, Jackson is known for popularizing dance moves such as the robot, the anti-gravity lean, the side slide, the crotch grab, and the moonwalk. He won many awards and broke records. He is the most successful entertainer of all time, according to Guinness World Records.
