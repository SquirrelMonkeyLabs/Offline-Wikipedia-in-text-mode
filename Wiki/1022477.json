 "text": "The hornbill bubble-nest frog, Shyamrup's bush frog, or Shyamrup's bubble-nest frog (Rohanixalus shyamrupus) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists think it might also live in Myanmar. ==Home== This frog lives in forests. People see it near the outsides of forests, not in the middle. They also see it on farms, near places where people live, and in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. It does not need the tree branches to come together like a roof but it does need many smaller plants. People have seen this frog between 200 and 1600 meters above sea level. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Namdapha National Park. Scientists think it could also live in Pakke Tiger Reserve. ==Young== This frog lays eggs on plants in wet land near water. The female frog makes a nest out of bubbles on plants over the water. Scientists think these frogs lay eggs in May. That is when the male frogs call to the female frogs. ==Threats== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. It is in some danger from people changing the places where it lives to build towns, build dams for electricity, build roads, and build farms and from bad chemicals. Sometimes people hit this frog with cars and other things with wheels. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
