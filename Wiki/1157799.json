 "text": "Pool is a 1983 video game. Written by Mike Lamb and published by CDS Micro Systems. It was made for the 16K ZX Spectrum. It was re-released later in 1983 on CDS's Blue Ribbon label and again in 1986 on their \"2.99 Classic\" label. The game is based on the game of pool. == Gameplay == In Pool, the table begins with three red and three blue balls. Each player gets three shots with the white ball. The goal is to pot all six balls. The cue ball is aimed by moving a target around the edge of the table and setting the strength of the shot. The number of shots left goes down for each shot made unless a ball is potted, upon which it is restored to three. Blue balls are worth 20 points, and red balls 10 points. == Reception == In Crash magazine's review, the reviewers noted that balls moved \"accurately and smoothly\" with \"convincing\" rebounds. It was considered to be the best Spectrum version of arcade pool and awarded an overall score of 77%. Your Sinclair magazine rated Pool 6 out of 10, finding it was \"not the most imaginative of realisations\" but \"a pleasure to find a game where Euclid is of more use than blood-lust and whizzo reflexes\". Home Computing Weekly gave the game 5 stars, saying \"this is not the game I spent my misplaced youth on, but it's pretty close, and a good game too.\" However, they were less happy with the game's graphics. == References == == Other websites == * Pool at World of Spectrum * Pool at the Internet Archive Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:1983 video games",
