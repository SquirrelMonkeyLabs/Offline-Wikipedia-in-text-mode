 "text": "The Anti-Federalist papers is the name given to a number of essays, which some of the Founding Fathers of the United States wrote. The writers were opposed to the idea of a Constitution for the United States. These papers were written in the 1790s, and published in different newspapers. The Constitution wanted a stronger union between the states, the people who wrote the Anti-Federalist papers were opposed to this. All the essays were written under false names. The Anti-Federalist papers didn't have the same influence as the Federalist Papers, who argued in favor of a constitution. The Anti-Federalist papers were unable to stop the ratification of the constitution. They were important for the United States Bill of Righs, though. == Other websites == * Category:1790s in the United States Category:1790s works",
