 "text": "Desertion is a military word which means a soldier has left his position without permission. The soldier does not plan on returning. The term absence without leave (AWOL) can also be used, but is usually used where the soldier does intend to return. Usually a soldier who has been AWOL for more than 30 days is listed as a deserter. Deserting is treated as a serious offense; military law usually provides for the death penalty. The last United States soldier executed for desertion was Eddie Slovik in 1945. No U.S. soldier has been given more than 18 months in prison for desertion during the Iraq War. ==References== ==Other websites== * Missing movement from About.com * Memorial to German World War II deserters in Ulm, Germany at the Sites of Memory webpage * Memorial to all deserters in Stuttgart, Germany at the Sites of Memory webpage * AWOL Information Category:Types of crime Category:Military law",
