 "text": "Denial is a word used in psychology on defense mechanism. It means that someone denies that something has happened or is happening although he really knows it is true. Usually this happens because admitting it would cause a lot of pain. Denial is usually the first state of coping with losses. ==Examples== For instance, if someone close to a person dies, the survivor's first feeling might be denial, or refusal to accept the fact that the person is really dead. Denial, is also when you think that a team (like in football) will win a football match before its even started and refuse to accept the fact thet they could lose. Denial, is also when you refuse to accept the fact that someone else did something when you \"think you know\" it was a different person. ==Related pages== * Holocaust denial * Holodomor denial * Historical revisionism * Rwandan genocide denial * Cambodian genocide denial Category:Society Category:Psychology",
