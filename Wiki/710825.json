 "text": "\"Let's Get Loud\" is a 2000 song recorded by American singer Jennifer Lopez for her debut studio album On the 6 (1999). It was written by the song's co-writer Gloria Estefan for herself but she felt as if the song was too similar to her last songs and gave it onto Lopez. Estefan, who co-wrote the song alongside Kike Santander, stated that Lopez would have \"more fun with it\" and would put \"a new spin\" on it. \"Let's Get Loud\" is sometimes seen as Lopez's signature song. Estefan eventually released her own version of the song in 2011 as a bonus track on the deluxe Target edition of her album Miss Little Havana. ==References== Category:2000 songs Category:Jennifer Lopez songs",
