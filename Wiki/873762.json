 "text": "Air Belgium S.A. is a Belgian airline with the main office in Mont-Saint- Guibert and based at Brussels South Charleroi Airport. == History == In the summer of 2016, the company was found by Niky Terzakis, who worked for ASL Airlines Belgium. The main goal was to link Belgium with Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Wuhan, Zhengzhou and Taiyuan. The first flight from Brussels to Hong Kong was planned October 2017, but this was planned for later because the airline didn't have an air operator's certificate (AOC). In December 2017, Air Belgium announced that the first flight should now take place in March 2018 from Brussels South Charleroi Airport instead of Brussels Airport because of lower airport taxes and easy accessibility; it was also announced that, for business class and premium passengers, the airline would operate from a new terminal, while economy passengers would use the regular terminal. On 14 March 2018, the airline received its AOC and planned to begin operating scheduled flights from mid-April. On 30 January 2021, Air Belgium announced that cargo flights will start with four Airbus A330-200F based in Li√®ge Airport, on behalf of French shipping giant CMA CGM. On 1 July, Air Belgium modernises its fleet with the induction of two new Airbus A330-900 aircraft and will fly from Brussels Airport to Mauritius from 15 October, 2021. == References == Category:2010s establishments in Belgium Category:2016 establishments in Europe Category:Airlines of Europe Category:Companies of Belgium Category:Transport in Belgium",
