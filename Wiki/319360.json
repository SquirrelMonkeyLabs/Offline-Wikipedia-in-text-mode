 "text": "Jean-Honoré Fragonard (5 April 1732 in Grasse – 22 August 1806 in Paris) was a French artist. He is remembered as one of the most important French painters of the rococo style. He was a pupil of François Boucher, and developed Boucher's style further. At first he did historical paintings, but soon gave up on these. He then painted things that were light-hearted, and slightly erotic. His works include The Swing, A Young Girl Reading, and The Secret Meeting. Together with Boucher and Antoine Watteau, he is one of the principal painters of French Rococo. He lost his wealth during the French Revolution. After the revolution, the painting style was different, because he had trouble adapting, he died a poor man. == Gallery == File:Fragonard, Inspiration.jpg|Self-portrait, 1769 File:Fragonard 1775 adoration des bergers Louvre.jpg|Adoration of the Shepherds (1775) File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard 019.jpg|Girl playing with dog File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard 009.jpg|The Lock File:Fragonard, The Swing.jpg|The Swing File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard - Blind Man's Bluff.jpg|Blind Man's Bluff File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard 014.jpg|The Swing File:Fragonard Confession of Love.jpg|Confession of Love == Related pages == * List of French painters == References == Category:French painters Category:Writers from Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Category:1732 births Category:1806 deaths Category:People from Alpes-Maritimes",
