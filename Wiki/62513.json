He was Prime Minister of Lebanon from 1992 to 1998, and he became Prime Minister again in 2000. But on October 20, 2004, he quit his job. He helped a lot in rebuilding Beirut, which was damaged from the fighting during the civil war. == Death == Hariri was killed along with 21 other people on February 14, 2005 by a truck bomb. A thousand kilograms of TNT exploded in a van near his car. His car was passing through St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. People are still trying to learn who did it, and the United Nations have helped to investigate. Serge Brammertz is leading this investigation. Many people in Lebanon said that the government of Syria and its allies did it. So far, Brammertz said that DNA evidence collected from the exploded area shows that the killing was done by a young man who blew himself up at the time. == References == Category:1944 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Assassinated Lebanese people Category:Billionaires Category:Lebanese businesspeople Category:Lebanese Muslims Category:Prime ministers of Lebanon",
