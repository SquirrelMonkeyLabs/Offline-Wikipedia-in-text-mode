 "text": "Functionalism in the philosophy of mind is the doctrine that what makes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on its internal constitution. But rather on the way it functions, or the role it plays, in the system of which it is a part. ==History== This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle's conception of soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes's conception of the mind as a \"calculating machine\", but it has become fully articulated only in the late 20th century. Though functionalism is used for designating a variety of positions in a variety of other disciplines, including psychology, sociology, economics, and architecture, this entry focuses exclusively on functionalism as a philosophical thesis about the nature of mental states. ==References== Category:Culture Category:Society Category:Sociology Category:Philosophy Category:Anthropology",
