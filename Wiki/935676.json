Did You Know? features educational trivia videos such as videos of theories, mysteries, trivia and more. Currently, the channel Você Sabia?, with more than 40 million subscribers, is the 4th channel with the most subscribers in Brazil and the 43rd with the most subscribers in the world. On April 10, 2014 created a secondary channel called \"Você Sabia PLUS\", with the aim of focusing on game curiosities, but the channel ended up bringing together various subjects, such as videos from daily vlogs, gameplays and other themes. Most of the videos are focused on curiosities and facts related to the gamer world. The channel is updated less frequently than the main channel Did You Know?. == History == In the beginning, Lukas Marques and Daniel Mologni had a blog together, called Calma, Cara, which gathered daily news. After high school Daniel Mologni and Lukas Marques moved, getting back together again after two years at a YouPix event. In the beginning, videos were recorded remotely and joined during editing. With the growth of the channel, the duo moved to São Paulo where the production began to become professionalized. == Awards == Year Award Category Result Ref. 2017 My Nick Awards 2017 Favorite YouTube channel 2018 My Nick Awards 2018 Favorite YouTube channel 2019 My Nick Awards 2019 Favorite YouTube channel 2020 Digital Influencers Award Knowledge and Curiosities ==References== == Other websites == * * * * Category:Official website not in Wikidata Category:YouTubers",
