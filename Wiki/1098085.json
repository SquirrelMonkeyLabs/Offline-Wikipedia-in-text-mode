 "text": "Casper the Friendly Ghost is a made-up character created by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo for a children's book in the 1930s. When they couldn't publish it, they made a deal with a movie studio to make a cartoon based on their idea. So they made a short called The Friendly Ghost. After it was successful, they made other Casper cartoons. ==References== == Other websites == *Seymour Reit Obituary, The Guardian Category:Animated characters Category:Movie characters",
