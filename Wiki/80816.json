 "text": "In mathematics, a coefficient is a constant multiplicative factor of a certain object. For example, the coefficient in 9x2 is 9. A coefficient can also be a variable such as a, b and c. The object can be such things as a variable, a vector, a function, etc. In some cases, the objects and the coefficients are indexed similarly, leading to expressions such as: :a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 + \\cdots where an is the coefficient of the variable xn for each n = 1, 2, 3, â€¦ == Related pages == * Polynomial == References == Category:Algebra",
