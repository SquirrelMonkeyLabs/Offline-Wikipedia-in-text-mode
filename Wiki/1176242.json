 "text": "Bassipterus (meaning \"Bass wing\") was a prehistoric genus of eurypterid found in deposits of West Virginia and Maryland. It is part of the family Adelophthalmidae and has a single species, B. virgnicus. == Description == Bassipterus has a round, tray-shaped head and the carapace is surrounded by a marginal rim. The swimming legs of this creature are Hughmilleria-type and the genital operculum could mean Bassipterus is closely related to another genus called Pittsfordipterus. == History == Bassipterus was described by paleontologists Erik Norman Kjellesvig-Waering and Kenneth Edward Caster. Since Bassipterus translates to \"wing of Bass\", most fossils of this genus were found in Bass, West Virginia and a carapace was also discovered in Cumberland, Maryland. == Gallery == File:Bassipterus virginicus metastoma.png|Bassipterus metastoma File:Bassipterus virginicus operculum.png|Bassipterus operculum == Related pages == * Jaekelopterus * Megarachne ==References== Category:Arthropods Category:Animals of North America Category:Silurian eurypterids Category:Fossils",
