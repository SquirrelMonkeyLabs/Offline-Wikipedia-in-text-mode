The album holds singles by John Mayer like \"Waiting on the World to Change\", \"Gravity\", and \"Belief\". == Album == The album features mainly new songs, though \"Gravity\" and \"Vultures\" are available in live versions from John Mayer Trio's Try!, and \"Bold as Love\", which is a Jimi Hendrix cover: the first Hendrix cover that Mayer has ever recorded as a studio release (although Mayer has recorded other Hendrix songs over time in live settings such as \"The Wind Cries Mary\" and \"Wait Until Tomorrow\"). (Mayer had played \"Bold as Love\" live many times prior to the release of Continuum such as on the televised Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope which aired on January 15, 2005.)
