It is also known as an enneakaidecagon or a nonadecagon.. == Regular enneadecagon == All sides of a regular enneadecagon are the same length. Each corner is ≈161.052°. All corners added together equal 3060°. The radius of the circumcircle of the regular enneadecagon with side length t is R=\\frac{t}{2} \\csc \\frac {180}{19} (angle in degrees).
