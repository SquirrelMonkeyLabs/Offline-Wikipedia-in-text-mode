In television the producer usually has creative control. In movies, the director has creative control. Most television directors specialize in directing one type of television program. ==Duties== A television director has a complex job that includes approving scripts, setting up camera shots, laying out scenes and deciding on lighting.Paddy Chayefsky, The Television Plays (New York: Applause Books, 1995), p. 269 The director is responsible for directing of live broadcasts, filming programs, post-production editing and mixing. A director also supervises the technical crew. A director's duties can be very different depending on the type of program. For example a drama recorded in a studio is different from a live event outside the studio. In a dramatic arts production, the television director's job can be similar to that of a movie director. A director gives cues to actors and directs the camera placement and movement. Often, in a television series, different directors will work on different episodes. == Related pages == *Producer *Screenwriter *Television presenter *Television producer == References == == Other websites == * Television Director at The Museum of Broadcast Communications",
