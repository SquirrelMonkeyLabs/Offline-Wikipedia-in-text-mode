The Washington Capitals placed first in the Eastern Conference, earning home advantage in Eastern Conference playoffs. Note: Bolded teams qualified for the playoffs. Under NHL rules, first-place teams in each division receive a conference ranking between 1 and 3 regardless of overall points. The Pittsburgh Penguins placed fourth yet had more points than the Boston Bruins, but the Bruins placed first in the Northeast Division to get the third-place ranking. ==Playoffs== The 2011 playoffs started on Wednesday, April 13, 2011, and ended with the seventh game of the Stanley Cup Final on Wednesday, June 15, 2011. ===Playoff bracket=== In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Final series, home ice is determined based on regular season points. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team plays at home for games one and two (plus five and seven if necessary), and the lower-seeded team is at home for games three and four (and if necessary, game six). == NHL awards == 2010–11 NHL awards Award Recipient(s) Stanley Cup Boston Bruins Presidents' Trophy Vancouver Canucks Prince of Wales Trophy Boston Bruins Clarence S.
