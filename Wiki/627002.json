 "text": "Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956), popularly known as Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was an Indian jurist, economist, politician, writer and social reformer. He inspired the Dalit Buddhist Movement and campaigned against social discrimination against Untouchables (Dalits), and also supported the rights of women and labour. He was independent India's first law minister, the principal architect of the Constitution of India. In 1956, in Deekshabhoomi, he initiated a mass conversion of Dalit, converting to Buddhism with 600,000 supporters. He revived Buddhism in India. Ambedkar is regarded as a bodhisattva, and the Maitreya, among the Navayana Buddhists. In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture. Ambedkar's legacy as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on modern India. Ambedkar was voted \"the Greatest Indian\" in 2012 by a poll organised by History TV18 and CNN IBN, ahead of Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. Ambedkar Jayanti (Ambedkar's birthday) is an annual festival celebrated on 14 April. Ambedkar Jayanti is celebrated as an official public holiday in many states of India.http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02est/12_6_2015_JCA-2-19032015.pdf Ambedkar Jayanti from ccis.nic.in on 19 March 2015http://persmin.gov.in/ Webpage of Ministry of Personnel and Public Grievance & Pension125th Dr. Ambedkar Birthday Celebrations Around the World. mea.gov.in The United Nations celebrated Ambedkar Jayanti in 2016, 2017 and 2018. == References == Category:1891 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Buddhists Category:Indian revolutionaries Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:20th-century Indian writers Category:Asian anthropologists Category:Indian lawyers Category:Indian economists Category:Indian educators Category:Indian philanthropists Category:Indian editors Category:Humanitarians Category:Politicians from Maharashtra Category:Jurists",
