 "text": "Chicago Landmark is a designation of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Sites are selected after meeting many criteria, such as historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social importance. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it is subject to the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations must be done with a permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks having more Federal protection. ==References== *",
