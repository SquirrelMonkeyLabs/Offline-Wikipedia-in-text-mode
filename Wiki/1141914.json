 "text": "Free solo climbing is a type of rock climbing where the climber does not use a rope, harness, or other safety gear. The climber only uses their hands and feet to move up the rock wall. Because there is no safety equipment, it is very dangerous. If the climber falls, they could be seriously hurt or die. == Differences from other climbing == Free solo climbing is different from other types of climbing. In free climbing, the climber uses a rope and other gear to stay safe, but only uses their body to climb. In aid climbing, the climber uses equipment to help them move up the rock. Free solo climbing does not use any safety gear or equipment to help the climber. Some climbers also do something called \"deep-water soloing.\" This is like free solo climbing, but it happens over water. If the climber falls, they fall into the water instead of onto the ground. == Famous climbers == One of the most famous free solo climbers is Alex Honnold. In 2017, he climbed El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without any safety gear. Many people think this is one of the greatest climbing achievements ever. Another famous free solo climber is Alain Robert, also known as \"The French Spider-Man.\" He is famous for climbing tall buildings. == Dangers == Free solo climbing is very dangerous because there is no safety gear. If the climber makes a mistake, they can fall and get hurt or die. Even experienced climbers can die while free solo climbing. For this reason, not many people try it, and those who do are usually very skilled and experienced. == In media == === Movies and documentaries === Free solo climbing has been shown in movies and documentaries. The documentary Free Solo shows Alex Honnold's climb of El Capitan. It won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2019. === Books === * * * == References == ==Pictures of free solo climbing== File:Robi-Bosh-Alain-Robert.jpg|Alain Robert, free soloing \"No Self Control\" (grade 7a), Verdon, France, 3 April 1991 File:Alex_Honnold_El_Capitan_Free_Solo_4.png|Alex Honnold, free soloing \"Freerider\" (grade 5.13a) on El Capitan, Yosemite, California, United States, 3 June 2017 == Related pages == * Rock climbing * Deep-water soloing * Alain Robert * Alex Honnold Category:Rock climbing",
