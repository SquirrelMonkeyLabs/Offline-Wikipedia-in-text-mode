Murray Bookchin The Guardian August 8, 2006 was an American libertarian socialist, political and social philosopher, speaker and writer. For much of his life he called himself an anarchist, although as early as 1995 he privately renounced his identification with the anarchist movement. Biehl, Janet. \"Bookchin Breaks with Anarchism\". Communalism October 2007: 1. A pioneer in the ecology movement,John Muir Institute for Environmental Studies, University of New Mexico, Environmental Philosophy, Inc, University of Georgia, ‘‘'Environmental Ethics’’’ v.12 1990: 193. Bookchin was the founder of the social ecology movement within libertarian socialist and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books on politics, philosophy, history, and urban affairs as well as ecology. Bookchin was a radical anti-capitalist and always favored the decentralisation of society. His writings on libertarian municipalism, a theory of face-to-face, grassroots democracy, had an influence on the Green Movement and anti-capitalist direct action groups such as Reclaim the Streets. His criticisms of \"new age\" Greens such as Charlene Spretnak contributed to the divisions in the American Green movement in the 1990s. Although an anti- capitalist, Murray Bookchin often met with libertarian thinker Murray Rothbard and occasionally attended Libertarian Party (United States) conventions, endorsing their presidential candidate Roger MacBride in 1976. Bookchin has influenced the thinking of captured Kurdish militant Abdullah Öcalan, who has renounced violence and now wants a peaceful solution to the question of Kurdish autonomy. ==Libertarian municipalism== Bookchin was the first to use the term \"Libertarian municipalism\", to describe a system in which libertarian institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the State with a confederation of free municipalities.Libertarian Municipalism: An Overview Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers—the municipal confederations and the nation-state—cannot coexist. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * Our Synthetic Environment 1962 * * The Limits of the City (1973) . * * * * * The Rise of Urbanization and the Decline of Citizenship (1987 and 1992) * The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism (1990 and 1996) Montreal: Black Rose Books. * * * * * * ===Articles=== * \" Beyond Neo-Marxism \".
