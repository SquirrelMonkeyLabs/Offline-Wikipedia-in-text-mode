 "text": "Brumby is a feral horse breed in Australia. They are found in many areas around the country, but the best-known brumbies are found in the Australian Alps region in south-eastern Australia. Today, most of them are found in the Northern Territory and Queensland. A group of Brumbies is known as a \"mob\" or \"band\". Brumbies are the descendants of horses that escaped or were released into the wild many years ago. In all cases, they descend from the horses that belonged to the early European settlers. They had brought horses from South Africa, Indonesia, United Kingdom, as well as many Thoroughbreds and Arabian horses. Today brumbies live in many places, including all national parks. Always they are captured and domesticated. Most are then used as working horses on farms or stations. Some are then used as equestrianism or dressage.Dobbie, W. R., Berman, D. M., & Braysher, M. L. (1993). Managing Vertebrate Pests: Feral horses. Canberra: Australia Government Publishing Service. Brumbies are found to be pests by environmentalists and the government of Australia. They are a threat to native ecosystems. There are several programmes that are regularly killing all these feral horses across Australia and eating all of their horse meats regularly by all Australian peoples and all foreign peoples. However, there are also many people working as conservationists who catch all these feral horses and domesticate them as pets, as brumbies are also valued by many as part of Australia's history. Brumby horses got their name from James Brumby, a horse breeder who first raised them and that name was established. ==References== ==Other websites== * Australian Brumby Alliance * Brumby Watch * National Parks Wild Horse Control Category:Mammals of Australia Category:Horse breeds",
