 "text": "Katakana (カタカナ) is a Japanese script for writing words borrowed from other languages. It is easier to read than kanji, the picture method that is based on Chinese characters. Once the 46 katakana symbols have been learned, a reader knows how to pronounce them. Both katakana and hiragana are syllabaries. English uses the letters of the alphabet, and most words, each letter stands for a bit of sound (phoneme). In a syllabary, each symbol stands for a syllable. For example, English “Wagamama” has each of the eight letters stand for a sound: “W-a-g-a-m-a-m-a”. However, if the word “Wagamama” is divided into syllables, there are four syllables: Wa-ga-ma-ma. In katakana, it is written with four symbols: ワガママ. Hiragana works in the same way, but most symbols. Katakana is perhaps a little easier to learn than hiragana because the symbols are simpler and more “squared off”.This refers to modern angular katakana (カタカナ) Together, Katakana and Hiragana are called “kana.” == Table of katakana == This is a table of the basic katakana strokes. The first chart shows the basic katakana. Characters with red letters next to them are no longer used. vowels vowels vowels vowels vowels yōon yōon yōon ア a イ i ウ u エ e オ o ャ ya ュ yu ョ yo カ ka キ ki ク ku ケ ke コ ko キャ kya キュ kyu キョ kyo サ sa シ shi ス su セ se ソ so シャ sha シュ shu ショ sho タ ta チ chi ツ tsu テ te ト to チャ cha チュ chu チョ cho ナ na ニ ni ヌ nu ネ ne ノ no ニャ nya ニュ nyu ニョ nyo ハ ha ヒ hi フ hu, fu ヘ he ホ ho ヒャ hya ヒュ hyu ヒョ hyo マ ma ミ mi ム mu メ me モ mo ミャ mya ミュ myu ミョ myo ヤ ya ユ yu ヨ yo ラ ra リ ri ル ru レ re ロ ro リャ rya リュ ryu リョ ryo ワ wa ヲ wo ン n ガ ga ギ gi グ gu ゲ ge ゴ go ギャ gya ギュ gyu ギョ gyo ザ za ジ ji ズ zu ゼ ze ゾ zo ジャ ja ジュ ju ジョ jo ダ da ヂ (dji) ヅ (dzu) デ de ド do ヂャ (ja) ヂュ (ju) ヂョ (jo) バ ba ビ bi ブ bu ベ be ボ bo ビャ bya ビュ byu ビョ byo パ pa ピ pi プ pu ペ pe ポ po ピャ pya ピュ pyu ピョ pyo Because Japanese today borrows so many foreign words they have invented several extra katakana symbols to help to write sounds that the Japanese language does not have: イェ ye ウィ wi ウェ we ウォ wo ヴ vu ヴァ va ヴィ vi ヴェ ve ヴォ vo ヴャ vya ヴュ vyu ヴョ vyo シェ she ジェ je チェ che ティ ti トゥ tu テュ tyu ディ di ドゥ du デュ dyu ツァ tsa ツィ tsi ツェ tse ツォ tso ファ fa フィ fi フェ fe フォ fo フュ fyu From the first table, it can be seen that there are 46 basic characters (top left, first five columns, from \"a\" to \"wa\"). Diphthongs (vowels that slide from one sound to the other) are written with an extra symbol in small print. For example, the sound “mu” in our word “music” sounds like “myu” so it is written ミュ (mi+yu). Therefore, the word “musical” (as in a stage musical) is written: ミュージカル. A long vowel is shown in katakana by a kind of dash, called a “choon” (ー). == Use == Katakana is used to write words that have been borrowed from other languages foreign names and names of countries. For example, America is written as アメリカ. It is not always easy to recognize the words because Japanese does not have all of the English sounds. That makes Japanese use other ways to pronounce and write words. For example, the word “coffee” is written コーヒー (koo-hii). Words are sometimes shortened as well: “television” is written as テレビ (pronounced “te-re-bi”). It is sometimes impossible to show the difference between two foreign words, e.g. ラーラー could spell either the name “Lara” or “Lala” (as in the Teletubbies). The Japanese have just one sound, which is somewhere between our “r” and “l”. In Japanese, a consonant is always followed by a vowel. Since words or syllables cannot end in a consonant except “n” or “m,” Japanese adds an extra vowel. “Ski” (as in skiing) becomes “suki” (スキ), and a “musical”, as noted earlier, becomes “myuujikaru” (ミュージカル). Katakana can be also used for onomatopoeic words like “ding,” or to make words look important, or for scientific names of species. Sentences in books or cartoons may be written in katakana to show that someone is supposed to be speaking with a foreign accent. It is often used to write the names of Japanese companies:. Suzuki is written スズキ and Toyota トヨタ. A small “tsu” ッ, called a “sokuon,” shows as a double consonant: the English word “bed” is used in Japanese for a western-style bed, pronounced “beddo” and written ベッド. The ッ makes the “e” vowel short. Learning to read katakana is useful for reading Japanese signs or restaurant menus. Japanese sentences are written usually with a mixture of katakana, hiragana and kanji: 私はアメリカ人です (Watashi wa amerikajin desu: I am American).has “amerika” written in katakana, \"Watashi\"(私) and the ending “-jin”(人) are written in kanji, and “desu” (I am) is in hiragana. == Related pages == * Japanese language * Hiragana * Writing system * Syllabary == Footnotes == == Other websites == * Real Kana Practice katakana using different typefaces * Katakana Lessons * Test your Katakana knowledge Category:Japanese writing system",
