 "text": "Ska is a popular music from Jamaica that began in the 1950s. Ska music that was first played at a slower tempo then became reggae in the late 1960s. Ska music bands include singers, electric guitars, electric bass guitar, piano, organ, saxophone, trumpet, and trombone. In ska, the electric guitar and piano normally play short chords on the off-beat. If you go \"one and two and three and four\", the off-beat is the \"and\". A ska singer does a style of Jamaican singing called \"toasting.\" When a singer is \"toasting\", they make sounds, repeat words, invent rhymes, and shout into the microphone. The Jamaican \"toasting\" style of singing and talking was adapted into rap music in the 1980s. == How Ska musicians dress == Musicians who play ska dress in hats and suits. Many ska bands wear clothes with a chessboard pattern of black and white squares. Doc Martens are a common type of shoe. This pattern symbolizes the way that ska music mixes of Black and White musicans and styles of music.There was a British genre of ska-punk influenced by The Specials, Madness and the English Beat, that began to dress in kilts. == 1980s Ska Revival == Even though ska was developed in the 1950s, it became popular again in the 1980s in Britain. In the 1980s, ska bands such as The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat, UB40 and Madness played ska music. == 1990s Ska mixed with punk rock == In the 1990s, some bands mixed ska music with Punk rock to make ska-punk.
