 "text": "Guosa is a constructed language. It was created by Alex Igbineweka in 1965. It was designed to be a combination of the indigenous languages of Nigeria and to serve as a lingua franca to West Africa. == Source languages == Though Guosa draws its vocabulary from at least 118 native West African languages, it gets most of its vocabulary from Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, either taken directly or made from a combination of words from these languages. English also provides many of the more technical terms, either directly or through one of the African languages said before. Also, some words were produced a priori via sound symbolism, e.g. meeh \"sheep\", yanmu-yanmu \"mosquito\", and wuam \"eat\". The different parts of speech came from particular languages. Most nouns come from Hausa, while verbs and abstracts come from Igbo or Yoruba. Also, words from all three source languages are often joined together to create a word that looks like all three. For example, the Guosa word m√©ni \"what\" comes from Hausa menini, Igbo gini, and Yoruba kini, all meaning \"what\". == References == Category:Languages of Africa Category:Constructed languages Category:Languages of Nigeria",
