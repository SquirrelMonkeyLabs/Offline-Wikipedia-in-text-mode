They were cut to a record low of 0.5%. On 12 March, the Government said it would spend billion to help the economy. It included a one-off A$750 payment to around 6.5 million people who already received income help from the government , small business assistance with 700,000 grants up to $25,000 and to pay 50% of the wages for 120,000 apprenticies or trainees for up to 9 months, 1 billion to support economically impacted sectors, regions and communities, and $700 million to increase tax write off and $3.2 billion to support short-term small and medium-sized business investment. On 19 March, the Reserve Bank again cut interest rates again to 0.25%, the lowest in Australian history. In March 2020, the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed how the virus was affecting the economy. Retail sales had increased by 0.4% in February 2020. This was probably because of increased sales at supermarkets where people were buying extra supplies in case they were put into isolation. Businesses that relied on tourism lost most of their sales. On 22 March, the government announced a second amount of A$66bn, bringing the amount to A$89bn. They doubled income support and made it easier to get the Jobseeker's allowance. They gave up to A$100,000 to small and medium-sized businesses and A$715 million to Australian airports and airlines. People were allowed to access up to A$10,000 of their superannuation in 2019–2020 and again for the next year. On 30 March, the Australian Government said they would spend $130 billion on the \"JobKeeper\" program. This would pay employers up to $1500 a fortnight for workers that had been in that business for over a year. The business had to have lost 30% of their turnover. For businesses who had made more than $1 billion, their turnover must have dropped by 50%. Businesses pay the Jobseeker money to their staff, instead of their usual wages. This program was to deal with the enormous job losses seen one week before, when about one million Australians lost their jobs. This massive loss in jobs caused the Australian Government's myGov website to crash and lines of people waiting to enter Centrelink offices were hundreds of metres long. The program was backdated to 1 March, to help re-employ the many people who had just lost their jobs in the weeks before. Businesses would receive the JobKeeper money for six months. In the first hour of the scheme, over 8,000 businesses applied for the payments. The JobKeeper program is one of the largest economic packages in the history of Australia. === Arts === Before the pandemic, 600,000 Australians worked in the arts, and added around billion to export revenues. The arts added about billion (6.4% of GDP) to Australia's economy in 2016–17\". In the second week of March 2020, Australian institutions began cutting back services, and many closed. The Melbourne International Comedy Festival, was cancelled entirely. Opera Australia close on 15 March. TAll cultural institutions were forced to close on 24 March. Public gatherings were banned. Other events that were cancelled included the Sydney Writers' Festival. By April over 50% of arts and recreation services were closed. Adrian Collette, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts, said the effects on the arts were “catastrophic”. The Australian movie industry was severely impacted. At least 60 movies in production were stopped and about 20,000 people put out of work. On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. , after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget. Many movie production companies do not meet the rules for the Jobkeeper program and will not get any government help. 119 films and TV shows were stopped, with only a few shows (such as MasterChef Australia and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell) continuing production through the pandemic. The TV soap Neighbours was the first English-language TV drama series in the world to say they would start production again after 20 April 2020. The Australia Council will spend about million for new programs. These will be to provide immediate help to artists, arts workers and arts organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several state governments have also provided relief packages. === Indigenous Australians === Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders have poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than the rest of the population, particularly those living in remote areas Overcrowded housing and living in very remote communities, makes them very vulnerable to the virus. The remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY lands) in South Australia, restricted access to their lands in early March to protect their people from the virus. The Northern Territory developed a remote health pandemic plan They set up a number of remote clinics. == Event cancellations == === National === * The World Surf League cancelled all events in March 2020. * All Anzac Day marches were cancelled.Coronavirus forces cancellation of Anzac Day services in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia ABC News 16 March 2020 * The 15 May school strike for climate rally and march was cancelled. * The Australian Border Force stopped all deportations to New Zealand between 16 and 30 March 2020. * NAPLAN tests for 2020 were cancelled on 20 March. * The national regional touring music festival Groovin' The Moo was cancelled. ==== New South Wales ==== * The Sydney Royal Easter Show, the largest ticketed event in Australia, was cancelled only for the third time in its 197-year history. * Vivid Sydney was cancelled for the first time in its history. * The Sydney Writers' Festival was cancelled * The Festival of Dangerous Ideas was cancelled. * The Byron Bay Bluesfest was cancelled * The Hunter Valley Steamfest was cancelled. * Splendour in the Grass was postponed from July 2020 until 23–25 October 2020. * The Sydney Film Festival was cancelled. * On 17 March 2020 the Canowindra International Balloon Challenge was cancelled. ==== Tasmania ==== * The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), cancelled the Dark Mofo winter arts festival.
