 "text": "Ronald Eugene Woodham IV, commonly known as Baby Boy Horry, was an American child whose dead body was found abandoned on the side of the road. For many years, no one knew his identity. His body was found on December 4, 2008, near South Carolina Highway 544, on the outskirts of Conway in Horry County, South Carolina. He was probably born on November 30 December 3, 2008 and died on December 4, 2008. Utility workers found his body in a bag that had been placed in a box. The coroner found that the child had died from hypothermia. Almost twelve years later, in March 2020, a woman was arrested. Evidence showed that she was the biological mother of the child known as Baby Boy Horry. She was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 4 years in prison. ==References== Category:2008 births Category:2008 deaths Category:2008 crimes Category:American murder victims Category:Murdered children",
