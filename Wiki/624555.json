 "text": "Earwax, (AKA cerumen or spuds,) is a sticky yellow, orange, brown, black or gold substance like wax produced by the ears. The earwax sticks to dust that gets in the ears to keep them clean. It also protects the skin of ear and protects ear from insects, water, fungi and bacteria. Some people try to remove earwax, which may damage the eardrum. The movement of jaws helps to clean the earwax naturally. Category:Hearing problems",
