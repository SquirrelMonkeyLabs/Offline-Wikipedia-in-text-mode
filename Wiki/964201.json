 "text": "The La Loma tree frog (Hyloscirtus colymba) is a frog. It lives in Costa Rica, Colombia, and Panama. Scientists have seen it as high as 1410 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 31.1 to 37.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 36.7 to 43.3 mm long. This frog is light green to light brown in color. Its belly is blue-green. There is a white line over each eye. There is a yellow stripe to the rear end. The frog's bones are green. We can see the bones through the skin. There is some webbed skin on the front feet and more on the back feet. There are disks on the frog's toes for climbing, but they are small. The male frog sounds like a cricket when it sings for the female frogs. The male frog is very careful. If it thinks anything big is nearby, it will stop making noise. It will hide under big rocks and stay there until it thinks it is safe. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
