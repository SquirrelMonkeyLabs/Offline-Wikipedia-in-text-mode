 "text": "A chocolate brownie (or simply called a brownie) is an American dessert or snack made with chocolate. It is named after the color brown. It tastes like a cross between a cake and a cookie. Unlike other cakes, it is baked without baking powder so it is much thicker. It is normally served cut into squares or rectangles. It can be eaten as a snack, or with ice cream or whipped cream as a dessert. ==Origin== There is no clear record of how brownies were first made. They were first made in the late 1880s. The first known recipe for brownies was in the 1897 Sears, Roebuck Catalogue. The most popular story about the origin of the brownie is about a housewife in Bangor, Maine. It says that the house wife forgot to add baking powder to a chocolate cake she was making. The cake did not rise but it was still delicious. Chocolate brownies are also very popular dessert in the United Kingdom. ==Types of brownies== There are different types of brownie. They are either chewy or cake-like depending on the recipe. Sometimes nuts or chocolate chips are added, or icing or caramel is put on top. A brownie with brown sugar and no chocolate are sometimes called a blondie. Sometimes, brownies are crackled on top, which means the inside is extra soft. Brownies are very yummy and easy to make. They can be made with a pack (Betty Crocker box) or from scratch. Sometimes you can put whip cream or chocolate sauce on it, and it will taste very good. ==Other websites== * Chocolate brownie recipe Category:Cakes",
