 "text": "Adelobasileus is an extinct proto-mammal from the Upper Triassic, about 225 million years ago. There is only a partial skull from strata in western Texas. Skull features, like the housing of the cochlea, suggest that Adelobasileus is a transitional form in the evolution from cynodonts to end-Triassic mammals. For this reason, it may be close to modern mammals' common ancestor.Lucas S.G. & Hunt A.P. 1990. The oldest mammal. New Mexico Journal of Science 30 (1): 41–49.Lucas S.G. & Luo Z. 1993.

Their sleek body type suggests they moved very fast. == References == == Other websites == *Adelobasileus from Palaeos Category:Therapsids",
