A presidential candidate in 2008, her candidacy in the 2016 election was her second bid for the presidency. She was widely seen as the front runner for the Democratic nomination, although she faced several challengers, especially Bernie Sanders. On November 9, 2016, after the presidential election, Hillary Clinton had lost to Donald Trump at the U.S. Electoral College. ==Background== According to nationwide opinion polls in early 2015, Clinton was the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.

On July 22, 2016, Clinton announced Virginia United States senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. ==Announcement== The Clinton campaign had planned a delayed announcement, possibly as late as July 2015. Her team decided to make the announcement earlier because of publicity about Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State. Clinton made her official announcement on the following Sunday, April 12, 2015. ==References== ==Other websites== * Clinton Category:Hillary Rodham Clinton",
