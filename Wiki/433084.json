Dee Roberts complained that she had been tricked into being on the programme. She said that the people on the programme thought the show was about a working class community, but that instead they had been portrayed as \"complete scum\". Almost 10,000 people signed a petition asking Channel 4 to show no more episodes of the show. Steve Haywood, a friend of an alcoholic in the programme known as Fungi, said that Channel 4 gave Fungi beer so that he would be on the show. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:2014 television series debuts Category:2010s British television series Category:British documentaries Category:Channel 4 television programmes Category:2014 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:English-language television programs",
