He got the idea for M&M;’s during the 1930’s Spanish Civil War when he saw British soldiers eating chocolate pellets with hard chocolate shells. He decided to make his own chocolate candies. He got the patent for these on March 3, 1941. The name M&M; comes from the founder’s name Forrest E. Mars Sr. The other M comes from the name of the son of the president of the Hershey Company, Bruce Murrie. The Mars Company started printing the white M on the candy in 1950. In 1954 the world famous M&M; characters made their first television appearance. In 1980 M&M;’s were sold across the world. == Resources == M&M;’s History. M&M;’s.
