It has many different attractions such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the famous Hollywood Sign. Many tourists come to Hollywood to see all of these things. Because of the importance of Hollywood in the movie industry of the United States, the whole industry is often called \"Hollywood\", even though not all movies are made in Hollywood. This use of the word \"Hollywood\" is called metonymy. Many historic Hollywood theatres are used as venues and concert stages to premiere major theatrical releases and host the Academy Awards. It is a popular destination for nightlife and tourism and home to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Hollywood Walk of Fame was created in 1958 and the first star was placed in 1960. It is a sidewalk along the Hollywood Boulevard and the USA. There are more than 2000 five-points stars on the walk featuring the names of artists working in the entertainment industry. The first movie to be made entirely in Hollywood was the 17-minute short In Old California. It was directed by D. W. Griffith. It was released in 1910. On the mountain overlooking Hollywood, there is a sign that is made of very big letters, spelling out its name. It's called the \"Hollywood sign\". The huge Hollywood sign was built in 1923. ==Related pages== * Bollywood ==Other websites== * * Hollywood Photos * Map of Los Angeles neighborhoods Category:Neighborhoods of Los Angeles",
