 "text": "The navagraha are nine bodies and gods that affect human life, according to Hinduism. The word is from nava, meaning nine, and graha, meaning planet. The nine parts of the navagraha are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the two nodes of the Moon. The word planet was made for only to the five planets known by the naked eye and so, never had the Earth. The word was later generalized, during the Middle Ages, to have both the sun and the moon (sometimes referred to as \"lights\"), making a total of seven planets. The seven days of the week of the Hindu calendar also relate with the seven classical planets and day names of Europe. In most languages of india, most Hindu temples around the world have a specific place dedicated to the worship of the navagraha. ==List== Navagrahas: Number. Image Name Western equivalent Day 1\\.
