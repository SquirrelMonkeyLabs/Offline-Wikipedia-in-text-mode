The instincts and their vicissitudes. The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology says that hate is a \"deep, enduring (long-lasting), intense emotion expressing animosity, anger, and hostility towards a person, group, or object.\"Reber, A.S., & Reber, E. (2002). The Penguin dictionary of psychology. New York: Penguin Books.
