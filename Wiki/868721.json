 "text": "In sociology, rape culture is a term that is used to describe a society where rape is common. This is mostly due to the views these societies have about gender and sexuality. Other behaviours that can often be found include victim blaming and sexual objectification. People in these societies may trivialize rape, or they say that it isn't much of a problem. They also often deny the fact that sexual violence is causing harm to the victim. Very often, there is a combination of all these issues.Herman, Dianne F. \"The Rape Culture \". Printed in Women: A Feminist Perspective (ed. Jo Freeman). McGraw Hill, 1994. Retrieved 18 October 2011. The term rape culture has also been used for other settings, or to describe the behavior of specific groups of people: Examples of these are people being raped in prison, or using rape in a war, as a form of psychological warfare. That way, entire societies have been called rape cultures. Some people also have sexual fantasies about raping someone, or being raped; in that context, their ideas may be seen as part of pornography. Second-wave feminists first had the idea of 'rape culture', in the 1970s. Most of them came from the United States. Critics of the concept say that it doesn't exist or is not widespread. They also say that even if there may be societies where rape is common, the concept of 'rape culture' implies that the person who rapes is not at fault; rather it is the society that made the rape possible. There are many movements who have addressed the idea of rape culture. They include movements such as SlutWalk and Me Too. Tatiana Burke, an American activist started Me Too, after she was sexually assaulted in 2006. Some of these movements have developed into self-help groups, where victims can talk about their experiences, and help each other. == References == Category:Rape Category:Cultural studies",
