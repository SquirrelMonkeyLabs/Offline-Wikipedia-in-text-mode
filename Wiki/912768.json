 "text": "Laacher See (literally: Lake Laach; ) is a volcanic caldera lake located in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The diameter is 2 km, and it is located 24 km from Koblenz, 8 km from Andernach and the Rhine River, and 37 km from Bonn. Its last volcanic eruption, which was a Plinian eruption, was around 11,000 years B.C., with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6, having the same magnitude as the Plinian eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. It is part of the mountainous Eifel region, and the East Eifel Volcanic Region, which was formed after the collision of the African and Eurasian continents millions of years ago. Bubbles of odorless CO2 gas called mofettas are released from the lake, which means that the volcano is dormant. To the west of the lake is the Maria Laach Abbey, built in 1092 by Henry II of Laach, Count of the House of Luxembourg. == References == == Other websites == * Continuous event display of the 10 most recent registered seismic activities measured from the Laacher See * Apokalypse im Rheintal (Cornelia Park und Hans-Ulrich Schmincke) * Martin Hensch, etal.: Deep low-frequency earthquakes reveal ongoing magmatic recharge beneath Laacher See Volcano (Eifel, Germany).
