 "text": "This is a list of minor planets in number This list does not include comets. This list does, however, include minor planets that are small bodies in the Solar System. There are asteroids, distant objects and dwarf planets that are included. Each catalog has 1000 minor planets. Every year, the Minor Planet Center publishes thousands of new numbered planets(see index). , there are 612,011 minor planets. == Example == |-bgcolor=#d6d6d6 | 189001 || 4889 P-L || — || 24 September 1960 || Palomar || PLS || — || align=right | 3.4 km || |-id=002 bgcolor=#fefefe | 189002 || 6760 P-L || — || 24 September 1960 || Palomar || PLS || NYS || align=right data-sort-value=\"0.96\" | 960 m || |-id=003 bgcolor=#d6d6d6 | 189003 || 3009 T-3 || — || 16 October 1977 || Palomar || PLS || — || align=right | 5.1 km || |-id=004 bgcolor=#C2FFFF | 189004 Capys || 3184 T-3 || || 16 October 1977 || Palomar || PLS || L5 || align=right | 12 km || |-id=005 bgcolor=#E9E9E9 | 189005 || 5176 T-3 || — || 16 October 1977 || Palomar || PLS || — || align=right | 3.5 km || |} The example above shows five catalog entries from one of the partial lists. These five asteroids were discovered at Palomar Observatory by the Palomar–Leiden survey.) 189004 Capys, discovered on 16 October 1977, is the only named minor planet. Its background color says that it is a Jupiter trojan. It is estimated to be about 12 kilometers in diameter. == Main index == Each table stands for 100,000 minor planets.
