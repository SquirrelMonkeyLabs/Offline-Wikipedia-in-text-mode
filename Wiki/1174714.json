 "text": "Survivor Series (1998) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on November 15, 1998, at the Kiel Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the 12th Survivor Series event held by the WWF. The show featured a 14-man \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. It was the first tournament held with the title on the line after ten years, the last being at WrestleMania IV. In the end, The Rock defeated Mankind to win the title for the first time because of another screwjob by WWF Chairman Mr. McMahon. Earlier, McMahon's son Shane helped Mankind advance to the finals and screwed fan favorite Stone Cold Steve Austin. The event was also the first Survivor Series not to feature any traditional Survivor Series matches. ==Matches== ==Tournament brackets== Decisions by pinfall (Pin), submission (Sub), disqualification (DQ), double countout (DCO), or Bye ==References== ==Other websites== *Official 1998 Survivor Series website Category:1998 in professional wrestling Category:1998 in American television Category:Survivor Series Category:Sports in St. Louis, Missouri Category:November events",
