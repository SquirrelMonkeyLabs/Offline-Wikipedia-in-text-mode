A large wind farm has several hundred wind turbines, and covers an area of hundreds of square miles. A wind farm may also be offshore. Many of the biggest onshore wind farms are in the USA. The Roscoe Wind Farm is the largest onshore wind farm in the world, producing 781.5 MW of power, followed by the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center (735.5 MW).
