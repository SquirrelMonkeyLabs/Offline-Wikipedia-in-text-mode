At the convention, delegates of the United States Democratic Party formally chose former Vice President Joe Biden for president and U.S. Senator Kamala Harris for vice president in the 2020 United States presidential election. Originally scheduled to be held July 13–16, 2020 at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in the United States, the convention was postponed to August 17–20, 2020, and was later shrunk its capacity, with its location moved to city's Wisconsin Center. Due to the pandemic, the format was different from other conventions, with most of the convention being held remotely from many venues across the country. While being a largely virtual convention, it was officially centered at the Wisconsin Center, where its production was headquartered and from where it was gaveled in and out each night. Joe Solmonese, former President of the Human Rights Campaign, was named convention CEO in March 2019. Every living former Democratic president (Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama) gave a speech, as well as a number of Republicans, including former Governor John Kasich of Ohio. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders also spoke at the convention. ==References== Category:2020 United States presidential election Category:2020 in Wisconsin Category:August 2020 events Category:Milwaukee Category:United States presidential nominating conventions 2020 National Convention",
