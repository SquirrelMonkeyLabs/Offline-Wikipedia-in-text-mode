 "text": "Maurice Boucher (21 June 1953 – 10 July 2022) was a Canadian murderer, drug trafficker, and outlaw biker—once president of the Hells Angels' Montreal chapter. Boucher led Montreal's Hells Angels against the rival Rock Machine biker gang during the Quebec Biker War. In 2002, Boucher was convicted of ordering the murders of two Quebec prison officers. He served three life sentences at Canada’s only supermax prison prison in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines. Boucher was transferred in June 2022 to get palliative care because of the metastasis of his throat cancer. He died on 10 July 2022 from the disease in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Canada at the age of 69. ==References== Category:1953 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Canadian drug traffickers Category:Canadian murderers Category:Canadian prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:People who died in prison custody Category:People convicted of murder Category:People from Quebec",
