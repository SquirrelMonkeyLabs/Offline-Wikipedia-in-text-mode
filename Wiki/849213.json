 "text": "Mohammad Sidique Khan (20 October 1974 â€“ 7 July 2005) was the oldest of the four Al Qaeda suicide bombers in the 7 July 2005 London bombings, in which bombs were exploded on three London Underground trains and one bus in central London suicide attacks, killing 56 people including the attackers and injuring over 700. He was believed to be the leader of the bombers. Khan bombed the Edgware Road train killing himself and six other people. On 1 September 2005, a recording was found that had Khan in. The recording, shown by Al Jazeera Television, also mentions Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is the highest leader of al- Qaeda. The two men do not appear together, and the British government says that al-Qaeda was not involved with the bombing. The Home Office believes the recording was edited after the suicide attacks and dismisses it as evidence of al-Qaeda's involvement in the bombing. In the film, Khan declares, \"I and thousands like me have forsaken everything for what we believe\" and refers to his expectation that the media would already have painted a picture of him in accordance with government \"spin\". He goes on to say, \"Your democratically elected governments continually perpetrate atrocities against my people all over the world. Your support makes you directly responsible. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation.\" == References == Category:1974 births Category:2005 deaths Category:British Muslims Category:Suicide bombers Category:English murderers Category:People from Leeds Category:July 2005 London bombings Category:Al-Qaeda people",
