 "text": "The Creoles of color are a historic ethnic group of Creole people that developed in the former French and Spanish colonies of Louisiana (especially in the city of New Orleans), Mississippi, Alabama, and Northwestern Florida in what is now the United States. French colonists in Louisiana first used the term \"Creole\" to refer to whites born in the colony, rather than in France. It was also used for enslaved people born in the colony.
