Marrakesh is the capital of the economic region of Marrakesh-Tensift-El Haouz. == History == Marrakesh is the most important city out of all of Morocco's cities that used to be imperial cities. Berber farmers lived in Marrakesh during Neolithic times. Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the chieftain and cousin of the king of the Almoravids Yusuf ibn Tashfin, founded Marrakesh in the year 1062. The Almoravids built many schools and mosques in Marrakesh. Marrakesh has the name \"Red City\" because a lot of it is made out of red sandstone. Marrakesh got bigger very quickly and became a cultural, religious, and trading center for sub-Saharan Africa. The mayor of Marrakesh Fatima Zahra Mansouri is the second woman mayor in Morocco. Tourism is important to Marrakesh, and the city has about 400 hotels. One of the things that most attract travellers to Morocco and, specifically, to the city of Marrakech, is the endless activities available and especially its variety. The most interesting and well-known are desert excursions from Marrakech, but in reality, you have many options: we are talking about excursions to the beach. There in the city itself, you do not have them, but there are many beaches near Marrakech that you can visit without much complication. ==References== Category:1060s establishments Category:Establishments in Morocco Category:11th-century establishments in Africa",
