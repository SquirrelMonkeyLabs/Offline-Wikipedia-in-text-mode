 "text": "Microsoft Windows is an operating system for computers made by the United States-based company Microsoft. Windows is used by almost 69% of desktop and laptop computers. == History == The first version of Windows, Windows 1.0, came out on November 20, 1985. The newest version, Windows 11, came out October 5, 2021. Most personal computers made after 2015 come with Windows 10. However, some older or cheaper personal computers may come with Windows 8.1 or Windows 7. Windows makes it easier to run programs (applications) than MS-DOS did. DOS required typed commands to make the computer do something. However, DOS required correct syntax of each command. Making mistakes caused the computer to usually give an error message and do nothing. == Design == Users control their Windows computer by its graphical user interface (or GUI for short). It only needs a keyboard or a mouse to work. In later versions, a touch screen works as well. However, using both a keyboard and a mouse makes many tasks easier. By clicking a few buttons on the screen, Windows helps keep your files safe, and easier to change and move. Versions of Windows after 2005 make it even easier for some users with disabilities because these versions have touch screens. For use of a touch screen, some mobile devices come with Windows. Tablet computers and smartphones such as Microsoft Surface and Microsoft Lumia use Windows. == Programs == The following programs are included with Windows: * WordPad – to write simple documents, typically using words/text. * Windows Photo Viewer – to look at pictures. * Microsoft Paint – to make simple drawings or change pictures. * Microsoft Edge web browser – to use the Internet to look at web pages and download files. * Windows DVD Player – to watch videos. * Windows Groove Music – to play and listen to music. Windows has several kinds of applications/programs available. Popular applications include games, word processors (to write words) or additional programs like Adobe Flash Player (to watch some videos and play many games on internet sites). Adding new applications to Windows is called \"installing\". Applications can be bought/purchased on a CD or DVD. Applications can also be downloaded from the Internet. Some internet applications can be downloaded for free, and others can be bought using the internet. == Versions == Release date Product name Notes Last IE November 20, 1985 Windows 1.0 Unsupported since December 31, 2001 (help for problems no longer given by Microsoft) December 9, 1987 Windows 2.x Unsupported since December 31, 2001 May 22, 1990 Windows 3.x Unsupported since December 31, 2001 July 27, 1993 Windows NT 3.1 Unsupported since December 31, 2001 5.x August 24, 1995 Windows 9x Unsupported (Windows 95 mainstream support ended on December 31, 2000 and extended support ended on December 31, 2001, for Windows 98 mainstream support ended on June 30, 2002, mainstream support for Windows ME ended on December 31, 2003 and extended support for both operating systems ended on July 11, 2006) 6 November 17, 1996 Windows CE Windows CE 6.0: Mainstream support ended on April 9, 2013; Unsupported as of April 10, 2018 Windows Embedded Compact 7: Mainstream support ended on April 12, 2016; Unsupported as of April 13, 2021 Windows 8 Embedded Compact 2013: Mainstream support ended on October 9, 2018; Unsupported as of October 10, 2023 6-7 February 17, 2000 Windows 2000 Mainstream support ended on June 30, 2005; Unsupported as of July, 13, 2010 6 September 14, 2000 Windows ME Mainstream support ended on December 31, 2003; Unsupported as of July 11, 2006 6 October 25, 2001 Windows XP Mainstream support ended on April 14, 2009; Unsupported as of April 8, 2014 8 April 24, 2003 Windows Server 2003 Mainstream support ended on July 13, 2010; Unsupported as of July 14, 2015 8 November 6, 2006 (volume licensing) January 30, 2007 (retail) Windows Vista Mainstream support ended on April 10, 2012; Unsupported as of April 11, 2017 Version Changed to NT 6.0.6001 with SP1 (4 February 2008) 9 July 2007 Windows Home Server 20xx Unsupported (Microsoft will help fix problems for this kind of Windows, including problems that make your computer less safe) 8 February 2008 Windows Server 2008 Mainstream support ended on January 13, 2015; Unsupported since January 14, 2020.

Some users complain that Windows made their computers slower when they changed from DOS. Many people also complain about problems that make their computer less safe to use, even though Microsoft tries to fix these problems. Many computer viruses are made to infect computers running Windows since it is such a popular operating system. Windows was the most popular operating system until recently (today mobile operating systems such as Android are more popular). == References == == Other websites == * The Microsoft Windows website * The Windows Team Blog – Official blog of the Windows Team at Microsoft Category:Microsoft operating systems",
