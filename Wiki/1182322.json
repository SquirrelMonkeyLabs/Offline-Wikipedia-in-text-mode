 "text": "The Power Mac G4 is a series of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from 1999 to 2004 as part of the Power Macintosh line. Built around the PowerPC G4 series of microprocessors, the Power Mac G4 was marketed by Apple as the first \"personal supercomputers\", reaching speeds of 4 to 20 gigaFLOPS. This was the first existing Macintosh product to be officially shortened as \"Mac\" (with the exception of the iMac), and is the last Mac able to boot into classic Mac OS with the introduction of Mac OS X. The enclosure style introduced with the Power Macintosh G3 (Blue and White) was retained through the entire five-year production run of the Power Mac G4, albeit with significant changes to match Apple's evolving industrial design and to accommodate increasing cooling needs. The G4 and its enclosure were retired with the introduction of the Power Mac G5. == Supported operating systems == Supported macOS releases OS release Graphite Digital Audio/QuickSilver Mirrored Drive Doors OS release Late 1999 (PCI) Late 1999 (AGP) Mid 2000 Early 2001 Mid 2001 Early 2002 Mid 2002 Early 2003 Mid 2003 Mac OS 8 colspan=2 Mac OS 9 colspan=2 10.0 Cheetah 10.1 Puma 10.2 Jaguar 10.3 Panther 10.4 Tiger 10.5 Leopard colspan=5 colspan=2 == References == Category:Apple hardware Category:Computer hardware",
