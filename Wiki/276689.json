There are two levels of government. * City-wide * local administration, based on the boroughs of Hamburg. As a federal state the city wide administration has much more responsibility and scope than in ordinary cities.

The legislature is the state parliament, called Hamburgische Bürgerschaft. The judicial branch is composed of the state supreme court and other courts. The seat of the government is Hamburg Rathaus. ==Political system== There is a clear separation of powers. ===Legislature=== The power to create, amend and ratify laws (legislature) is given to the parliament. A plebiscite and a referendum is possible due to the Constitution of Hamburg. In other German states the parliament is called Landtag.

In 1937 the German leader Adolf Hitler signed the book before giving a public speech in Hamburg. During the denazification Hitler's sheet, as these from other Nazis, was removed from the book. The only signature remained is from Joseph Goebbels, because he wrote on the same sheet as the former German President Paul von Hindenburg. The Dalai Lama signed the Golden Book during his 5th visit in Hamburg in February 2007. ;Decorations | |- | |} Hamburg citizens were not allowed to receive decorations – only medals or medallions. This act was first enlawed for members of the senate and Hamburg's judges, later the act was false legally extended for all citizens by the Senate of Hamburg. The act originated from the Hamburg city law of the 13th century. (in German) One of the few Hanseaten – citizens of a Hanseatic city – who received decoration was Alwin Münchmeyer, an entrepreneur. Münchmeyer stated later, that this were his \"falls of mankind\". Even Helmut Schmidt – former Hamburg Senator of the Interior and German chancellor – declined several times to be awarded with the Federal Cross of Merit, stating he had been a Hamburg senator and according to the Hanseatic tradition not allowed to wear decorations. In 1843 the Hamburg fire medal was awarded to the volunteers, who came to help during the great fire from 5 May until 8 May 1842. In total 4858 medals were awarded from the grateful Hamburg in distress to its friends, as the inscription states \"Das Dankbare Hamburg Seinen Freunden In Der Noth\". During World War I (1914 – 1918) the Hanseatic Cross (German: Hanseatenkreuz) was a decoration of the three Hanseatic Cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck, who were member states of the German Empire. Each city-state established its own version of the cross, but the design and award criteria were similar for each. There were approximately 50,000 awards of the Hanseatic Cross of Hamburg. ;Medallions In 2007 the Herbert Weichmann medallion – named for the First Mayor Herbert Weichmann (in office 1965 – 1971) – was granted for the first time by the city of Hamburg, honoring \"those - both Jewish and non-Jewish - who have contributed to Jewish life in Germany\". First recipients were Paul Spiegel (posthumous), who was a member of the executive committee of the Zentralrat der Juden, and Hinrich Reemtsma, whose foundation constributed €500,000 for the removal of the Jewish community centre in Hamburg. ==Related pages== * Boroughs and quarters of Hamburg * List of diplomatic missions in Hamburg == Notes == ===References === * Constitution of the Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg https://www.homeworkjoy.com/ ==Other websites== * http://www.hamburgische- buergerschaft.de/cms_en.php?templ=home_sta.tpl&sub1;=187&cont;=332 Official website of the Parliament of Hamburg * http://www.hamburg.de/stadt- staat/senat/ Senate of Hamburg * http://www.hamburg.de/buergerschaft/ Parliament of Hamburg on www.hamburg.de * http://www.polizei.hamburg.de Hamburg's police force official website * http://www.hamburg.de/ag- scientology/ Scientology Task Force official website Category:Hamburg",
