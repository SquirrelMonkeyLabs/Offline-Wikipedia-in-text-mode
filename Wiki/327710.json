The AS-90 is used by five regiments of the Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Artillery. AS-90 was designed and built by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL, owned by BAE Systems since 1999). They made 179 AS-90s from 1992 to 1995. This cost Â£300 million. In 2002 BAE Systems were asked to give 96 British Army AS-90s a 52 calibre gun. This would make the range 30 km. With special shells, it would be able to reach 60 to 80 km.Armed Forces - a6a4 - British Army - Artillery - AS 90 However, this project ended up being ended.Army Technology - AS90 BRaveheart 155mm - Self Propelled Howitzer ==Development== AS-90 started in the mid-1980s.
