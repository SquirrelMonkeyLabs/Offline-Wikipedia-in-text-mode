 "text": "Methylphenidate (name often shortened to MPH, brand names Ritalin and Concerta) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant drug similar to amphetamine. MPH stimulates the central nervous system. It does this by increasing dopamine transmission in the brain. == Use == MPH is made to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy most of the time. It is sometimes used together with other drugs to treat depression. In most countries, its use needs to be prescribed by a doctor. Sometimes, the drug has been prescribed to children without proper ADHD diagnosis to increase their academic performance. This use has been criticised by the media. Use in children may be problematic. Methylphenidate has been linked to slower growth in childhood usage. The media often use the name Ritalin for all drugs containing methylphenidate, even for other stimulants that are used to treat ADHD. Ritalin is an equal mix of two forms of methylphenidate which is used in such cases. It is a different formulation of similar drugs. == Side effects== The most common side effects of taking the drug are nervousness and sleeping problems. About one in ten patients see these problems. Other side-effects include changes of blood pressure, headache, and weight loss due to decreased appetite. Death because of methamphetamine use is a risk when taking methylphenidate. Some cases of Tourette syndrome and psychosis have been reported. == Recreational use== Methylphenidate will cause euphoria in recreational use. When it is abused in this way, it can cause intense mood increase, relatively short-lasting episodes of increased activity in the body and mental usually in a positive way. Abusing Methylphenidate may lead to dependence and the need to take more. The chance of developing dependency, with a physical or psychological addiction is high with this class of drugs. Severe side effects such as psychosis, cardiac arrest could develop with use. Especially with increased use. ==References== Category:Drugs used in psychiatry Category:Esters Category:Organonitrogen compounds",
