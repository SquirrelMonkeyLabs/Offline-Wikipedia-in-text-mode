 "text": "Jaekelopterus is an extinct genus of eurypterids from the Lower Devonian period. The two species are J. rhenaniae from the Rhineland, and J. howelli from Wyoming. == Etymology == The name Jaekelopterus comes from the discoverer of the type species, Otto Jaekel, and Greek pteron, meaning \"wing\". == Description == Jaekelopterus is the largest sea scorpions and is possibly the largest arthropod to have ever existed, this is based on a chelicera that is 36.4 cm long. === Characteristics === This sea scorpion is similar to other types of pterygotid in its morphology, distinguished by a triangular telson. === Visual system === Both Jaekelopterus rhenaniae and Pterygotus anglicus have high visual acuity, and this is suggested by the low IOA and that they have many lenses in their compound eyes. == Classification == === Discovery === Jaekelopterus was discovered by Otto Jaekel in 1914 as a Pterygotus species. However, in 1964, British paleontologist Charles D. Waterston decided to make the genus Jaekelopterus because the abdominal appendages were segmented as opposed to those of Pterygotus. === Species === * †Jaekelopterus rhenaniae Jaekel, 1914 * †Jaekelopterus howelli Kjellesvig-Waering & Størmer, 1952 == Gallery == File:20210106 Jaekelopterus rhenaniae.png|Drawing of Jaekelopterus File:Jaekelopterus.jpg|Fossil of J. rhenaniae File:Jaekelopterus Size 2.svg|Size comparison == Related pages == * Megarachne * Pterygotus * Eurypterus == References == == Other websites == * https://eweb.furman.edu/~wworthen/bio440/evolweb/devonian/jaekelopterus.htm Category:Devonian Category:Chelicerata Category:Animals of Europe Category:Animals of North America",
