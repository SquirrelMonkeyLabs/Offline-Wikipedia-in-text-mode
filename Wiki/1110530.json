 "text": "The Norwegian Constituent Assembly (called Grunnlovsforsamlingen or Riksforsamlingen in Norwegian) is the name for the meeting in 1814 at Eidsvoll in Norway. This meeting created the Norwegian Constitution and ended the union with Denmark. In Norway, people often call it Eidsvollsforsamlingen, which means The Assembly of Eidsvoll. == The assembly == They first met on 10 April near Eidsvoll Church, and the assembly officially started the next day. Delegates from all over the country were supposed to attend, but parts in the north were not represented because the distance was too far, and there was not enough time. The leaders of the assembly were called presidents and vice presidents. The presidents were: Peder Anker (10–17 April), Diderik Hegermann (18–24 April), Jens Schou Fabricius (25 April-1 May), Christian Adolph Diriks (2–8 May), Christian Magnus Falsen (9–16 May), and Georg Sverdrup (17–20 May). Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie was the permanent secretary. The Assembly finished the Constitution on 17 May 1814, which became Norway's National Day, though the document was signed on the 18th. Sverdrup, the last president, gave the final speech. The assembly members left on 20 May, promising to stay united and loyal. == Related pages == * Constitution of Norway == References == Category:History of Norway",
