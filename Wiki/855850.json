 "text": "At approximately 3 am on Wednesday June 23, 2021, 17 year old Hunter Brittain was shot by a sheriffs deputy, Michael Davis, near Cabot, Arkansas. Brittain was attempting to use a jug of antifreeze to stop his truck from rolling into the officer’s vehicle when the deputy shot him. Brittain’s family claimed he was test driving a truck which he had been working on when he was pulled over by the deputy. The death of Brittain inspired protests. Brittain’s family and friends have proposed “Hunter’s Law”. The law would require all Arkansas police officers to wear a body camera which would be kept turned on during their shift. In March 2022, Davis was found guilty of negligent homicide, but not guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 1 year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 1 year in jail is the maximum sentence for negligent homicide in Arkansas. ==References== Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:People shot and killed by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Police misconduct in the United States Category:2021 crimes in the United States",
