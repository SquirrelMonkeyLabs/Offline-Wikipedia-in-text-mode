 "text": "Translation means to copy writing or speech from one language into a different language. The people who do translation are called translators. A translator who is copying a book into another language may use a language dictionary to find out how a word is written in another language. A translator who works with the spoken word is also called an interpreter. Translators can work independently as freelancers or by being hired by translation agencies. People who translate poetry, novels, drama, or short stories are called literary translators. In computer technology, translation from a programming language to a machine language is called compiling. There are free translators on the internet. A notable example of this is Google Translate. == Related pages == *Bible translations *Concept *Compiler *Machine translation Useful resources related to the subject: * The Impact of Translation in New York City * Choosing the Perfect Translation Agency for your Company * Adapt your Translation for a better Understanding of Inter-culture *",
