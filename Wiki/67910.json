 "text": "A maid, housemaid or, formerly, maidservant is a female employed as a domestic worker. Maids perform typical domestic chores such as cooking, ironing, washing, cleaning the house, grocery shopping, caring for pets, and taking care of children like a nanny. In many places in some poor countries, maids often take on the role of a nurse in taking care of the elderly and people with disabilities. Many maids are required by their employers to wear a uniform. In June 2011, International Labour Organization has made its Convention No.189 for domestic workers including maids. == References == Category:Personal service occupations Category:Domestic work",
