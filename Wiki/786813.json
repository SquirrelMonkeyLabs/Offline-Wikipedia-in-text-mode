It was classified as secondary hill station by Aiken due to no growth happening in the town. The place name Treacher Hill comes from the former British Resident of Selangor, William Hood Treacher, while the other name Bukit Kutu comes from Orang Asli people who say that the road is too long until say \"Kutu\". \"Kutu\" in Malay language means flea and \"Bukit\" means hill, hence it is called as \"flea hill\".
