 "text": "Club cells, also called bronchiolar exocrine cells, are small, cube-shaped cells with tiny hair-like structures. They are found in the small airways (bronchioles) of the lungs. They were originally known as Clara cells. Club cells are found in the ciliated simple epithelium, a type of tissue. These cells may release substances called glycosaminoglycans to protect the lining of the small airways. As the number of goblet cells (mucus-producing cells) decreases, the number of bronchiolar cells (Club cells) increases. One of the main jobs of club cells is to protect the small airways in the lungs. They do this by releasing different substances, including a protein called uteroglobin and a solution that keeps the lungs from collapsing. They also help get rid of harmful substances that we breathe in. Club cells use special enzymes to detoxify these substances. Additionally, club cells can act as stem cells, which means they can multiply and turn into other types of cells to help repair and regenerate the lining of the small airways. ==References== Category:Human body Category:Cell biology",
