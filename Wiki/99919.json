It was seen while J. N. Spitale was trying to confirm the orbit of another object, that was seen 5 hours earlier just on the farther edge of the F ring. The announcement was made on September 9, 2004.IAUC 8401: S/2004 S 3, S/2004 S 4, and R/2004 S 1 2004 September 9 (discovery) Even though astronomers tried to find it again, it has not been reliably seen since. Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November, 2004 failed to find the object. This suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time. An interpretation where S3 and S4 are or were a single object on a F-ring crossing orbit is also possible. Such an object might also be orbiting at a bit different inclination to the F ring, thereby not actually passing through the ring material even though it was being seen both radially inward and outward of it. If a solid object after all, would be 3−5 km in diameter based on brightness. ==References== Category:Saturn's moons",
