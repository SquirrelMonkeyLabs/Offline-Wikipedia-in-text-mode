The back legs have dark brown stripes going sideways. The iris of the eye is gold in color with black marks. The belly is light in color. This frog lives in trees almost all the time. It hides during the day and looks for food at night. People have seen it in primary forest and secondary forest. When the male frogs sing for the female frogs, they sit on short plants or in the water. The female frog lays 2000 eggs at a time. The eggs are black in color. The female frog lays eggs on the surface of the water. The tadpoles eat frog eggs. They eat the eggs of other types of frogs but also the eggs of the Manaus slender-legged tree frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
