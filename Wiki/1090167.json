 "text": "Rail transport in Latvia is done on Russian gauge. The main railway company is the state-owned Latvian Railways (LDz), with its subsidiary Pasažieru vilciens running passenger services. Latvia had lot of different rail gauges, both standard gauge and narrow gauge. These were gradually replaced by the Russian gauge after the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states. The Rail Baltica project aims to connect Latvia and the other Baltic states to the European standard gauge by approximately 2030. Ten regional stations are planned in the section from Bauska to Salacgrīva. Although PV has been a monopoly in passenger trains, in February 2022 the Road Transport Administration of the Ministry of Transport of Latvia announced the first market survey on potential private rail passenger service providers. ==References==",
