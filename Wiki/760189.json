 "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Armenia on 1 March 2020 when its first case was confirmed. The disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (), caused by a new virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (), has spread to all of the regions (marz) of Armenia. Armenia suspended visa-free travel for Chinese citizens since 1 February, shortly after it pushed a 90-day visa-free regime on 19 January. Citizens of Iran could no longer receive a visa on arrival either. Passengers who had been to most of Europe, as well as Japan and South Korea, within the past 14 days, were no longer allowed to enter Armenia. The border of Armenia with the Republic of Artsakh was also closed in order to prevent the virus from spreading. Before the virus was confirmed to have arrived in Armenia, 118 tests were performed in February with negative results. ==References== Category:2020s in Armenia Armenia",
