It has been shown on TV channels in Britain including BBC One, BBC Two, and BBC Three. It can be viewed on Netflix and is sometimes shown on American TV channels including Starz . The show is a spin off of the British television series Doctor Who. It follows the Cardiff, Wales section of a secret group called the Torchwood Institute. The Torchwood Institute examines things that aliens cause to happen on Earth. They also collect alien equipment to use. The series is set in Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales. Series 1 takes place after Doctor Who Series 2. Series 2 takes place in between Doctor Who Series 3 and Series 4. Because the shows are science fiction and some characters live forever, it is hard to track down the exact times in which Doctor Who and Torchwood overlap. Torchwood stars John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, the leader of the Cardiff Torchwood Institute. Barrowman also played Harkness in Series 1, Series 3 and Series 4 of the current Doctor Who (2005). Eve Myles plays Gwen Cooper, a policewoman who joins the group. Gareth David-Lloyd stars as Ianto Jones, a person who helps out and is a love interest of Jack. Jack Harkness, Ianto Jones, and Gwen Cooper are the central cast members. Also, Naoko Mori plays scientist Toshiko Sato. Burn Gorman plays Doctor Owen Harper. Because the show is set in and around Cardiff, many of the local attractions like the Millennium Centre and Cardiff Bay are shown in the series. Country settings around Glamorgan are also used many times in the series. The programme is aimed at adults and older teenagers. The third series is a five episode long story named Children of Earth. Children of Earth has returning cast members John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, and Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto Jones. The fourth series is a ten episode story named Miracle Day. Miracle Day has returning cast members John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness and Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper. == List of episodes == === Series 1 episodes (2006-2007) === # Episode name Date shown 1 Everything Changes 22 October 2006 2 Day One 22 October 2006 3 Ghost Machine 29 October 2006 4 Cyberwoman 5 November 2006 5 Small Worlds 12 November 2006 6 Countrycide 19 November 2006 7 Greeks Bearing Gifts 26 November 2006 8 They Keep Killing Suzie 3 December 2006 9 Random Shoes 10 December 2006 10 Out Of Time 17 December 2006 11 Combat 24 December 2006 12 Captain Jack Harkness 1 January 2007 13 End of Days 1 January 2007 === Series 2 episodes (2008) === # Episode name Date shown 14 Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang 16 January 2008 15 Sleeper 23 January 2008 16 To the Last Man 30 January 2008 17 Meat 6 February 2008 18 Adam 13 February 2008 19 Reset 13 February 2008 20 Dead Man Walking 20 February 2008 21 A Day in the Death 27 February 2008 22 Something Borrowed 5 March 2008 23 From Out of the Rain 12 March 2008 24 Adrift 19 March 2008 25 Fragments 21 March 2008 26 Exit Wounds 4 April 2008 === Children Of Earth episodes (2009) === # Episode name Date shown 27 Day One 6 July 2009 28 Day Two 7 July 2009 29 Day Three 8 July 2009 30 Day Four 9 July 2009 31 Day Five 10 July 2009 === Miracle Day Episodes (2011) === # Episode name Date shown 32 The New World 8 July 2011 (US) 14 July 2011 (UK) 33 Rendition 15 July 2011 (US) 21 July 2011 (UK) 34 Dead of Night 22 July 2011 (US) 28 July 2011 (UK) 35 Escape to L.A. 29 July 2011 (US) 4 August 2011 (UK) 36 The Categories of Life 5 August 2011 (US) 11 August 2011 (UK) 37 The Middle Men 12 August 2011 (US) 18 August 2011 (UK) 38 Immortal Sins 19 August 2011 (US) 25 August 2011 (UK) 39 End of the Road 26 August 2011 (US) 1 September 2011 (UK) 40 The Gathering 2 September 2011 (US) 8 September 2011 (UK) 41 The Blood Line 9 September 2011 (US) 15 September 2011 (UK) ==References== == Other websites == * BBC - Torchwood * BBC - Torchwood on Twitter * BBC - Torchwood on Facebook * BBC - Torchwood on YouTube Category:2006 British television series debuts Category:2000s British drama television series Category:2000s LGBT television series Category:2000s science fiction television series Category:2010s British drama television series Category:2010s LGBT television series Category:2010s science fiction television series Category:BBC television dramas Category:British LGBT television programmes Category:British science fiction television series Category:Doctor Who Category:Glamorgan Category:LGBT drama television series Category:Television spin-offs Category:English-language television programs",
