It is famous for being the place where the Gold Seal of the King of Na, was found, and holding Shikaumi Shrine the ancestral shrine of the Azumi people. The island has a circumference of about 11 kilometers and is linked to the mainland via a causeway called Umi no Nakamichi (road). Two farmers found the golden seal on a hill overlooking Hakata Bay in 1784. The area was made into a park called Kin-in Park to celebrate the discovery. The seal is known as the Golden Seal of the King of Na and is a national treasure. Chinese records state that about 2,000 years ago, Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty gave a golden seal to a Japanese envoy to present to their king. The seal had the characters 「漢委奴国王」\"(Han wa na koku-ō\"), which means \"[From the King of] Han, presented to the King of Nakoku\". The seal is now kept at the Fukuoka City Museum. A notable person from the island is Yūki Yoda, a member of the Japanese idol group Nogizaka46.
