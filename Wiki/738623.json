Power, Place names of the Decies, David Nutt, 1907, p.207 In 1640, Lord Power of Curraghmore, who owned a large amount of property in the area, built a castle on the cliff overlooking the strand about two hundred metres from St. Andrew's Church. The castle was falling into ruin by the middle of the next century and now just one tower remains. In Smith's history of Waterford, the village was mentioned as being a fishing port about the year 1745.Charles Smith,Smiths History of Waterford, 1746 The fishermen's homes were in the Lower Village near the Strand Inn and boats were launched from the slip at Lawlor's Beach before the harbour was built. There is mention of a fleet of fifty fishing boats working from Dunmore East in 1776.J.J.Walsh, Waterford Yesterdays and Tomorrows, Munster Express, 1968. p. 156 In 1812 a decision was made at Westminster, London to create an entirely new landing point for passengers and mails coming to Ireland from London and southern England. The place selected was Dunmore East and £118,000 was set aside for the erection of a pier there.June Fennelly,Decies Journal, No. XXVI, 1984, p.17 In 1814 big changes took place when Alexander Nimmo commenced work on the new harbour at Dunmore. The work mainly the building of a large pier or quay with a lighthouse at the end. Nimmo's original estimate had been £20,000 but at the time of his death in 1832 about £93,000 had been spent and the final cost was £108,000. By then (1837) the harbour had started to silt up, so the packet station was transferred to Waterford city.Patrick C. Power,History of Waterford,. Mercier Press, 1990. p.136 The sheltered harbour meant that Dunmore East became an important fishing port. W.M. Nixon, Afloat.
