 "text": "\"Kimigayo\" (Kanji: 君が代, Hiragana: きみがよ, , meaning \"His Imperial Majesty's Reign\") is the national anthem of Japan.Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Japan Fact Sheet, pp. 2-4; retrieved 2011-12-23. The anthem is based on a poem written by an unknown poet from Japan about one thousand years ago. The music was composed more recently, about two hundred years ago; however, it had to be rewritten shortly afterwards, because the original tune was unpopular. Although popular for a long period and sung in situations where people from other countries would usually sing their country's national anthem, \"Kimigayo\" was only considered as Japan's official national anthem in 1999. The law that stated this also defined the Flag of Japan in a similar way. The national anthem of Japan is one of the shortest national anthems in the world, containing only thirty-two syllables. Because it is so short, the anthem is normally played very slowly. ==Lyrics== With Kanji characters Kana (Hiragana) only Rōmajihttps://web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/11NFlagAnthem.pdf National Flag and Anthem (PDF).
