 "text": "Andrea True (born Andrea Marie Truden, July 26, 1943 - November 7, 2011) was an American porn star and a singer from the disco era of the 1970s. She is best known for her single \"More, More, More\". It was released in 1976. It peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Career== True was born in Nashville, Tennessee as Andrea Marie Truden. She moved to New York City during her teenage years. She wanted to seek fame as a movie star or singer. True sang in clubs. She got minor roles in mainstream movies from time to time. She was in movies, such as The Way We Were. But the fame she sought was fleeting. When some friends asked her to join them in a porn movie, True went along with the idea. True acted in porn movies in Scandinavia in the 1960s. By the end of the decade, she began appearing in American adult movies. In the 1970s and 1980s, she acted in more than 50 hardcore porn movies in the early New York. By the time of her singing career, True said she was getting tired of porn. In early 1977, True released another song, \"N.Y. You Got Me Dancing\" from her follow-up studio album White Witch. The song was True's second biggest hit. It reached #27 on the American Billboard pop chart. True's third album, War Machine (1980), failed. When that happened, she tried to return to porn. But at almost 40, she was too old to return. She also could not go back to music due to a goiter that had developed on her vocal cords. ==Death== Andrea True died of heart failure in Kingston, New York, where she was raised. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Actors from Tennessee Category:American pornographic actors Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Singers from Nashville, Tennessee",
