 "text": "Gypsy jazz is a musical idiom. It is inspired by the Romani jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt (1910–1953), in conjunction with the French jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli (1908–1997), as expressed in their group the Quintette du Hot Club de France. Because its origins are in France, Reinhardt was from the Manouche clan, and the style has remained popular amongst this clan. Gypsy jazz is often called by the French name \"jazz manouche\", or \"manouche jazz\" in English language sources. ==References== Category:Roma Category:Jazz music",
