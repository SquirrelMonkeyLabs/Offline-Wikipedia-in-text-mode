 "text": "Numitor Silvius was a legendary king of Alba Longa, an ancient city in central Italy and an ancestor of the founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus. He was known for his just rule and is celebrated in Roman mythology as the grandfather of the legendary twins who went on to establish Rome. Numitor was the eldest son of Procas, who reigned before him as king of Alba Longa. == Life and reign == Numitor inherited the throne of Alba Longa from his father, Procas. His reign, however, was disrupted by his younger brother, Amulius, who seized the throne in a violent coup. Amulius sought to ensure his power by forcing Numitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, into becoming a Vestal Virgin, which would prevent her from bearing any children who might challenge his rule. Despite this, Rhea Silvia gave birth to the twins Romulus and Remus, fathered by the god Mars, according to legend. == Deposition by Amulius == After taking control, Amulius feared that any descendants of Numitor might reclaim the throne. To eliminate any potential threat, he ordered that Romulus and Remus be abandoned in the Tiber River. The twins, however, were miraculously saved and raised by a she- wolf (lupa) and later by a shepherd named Faustulus. When they grew older and learned of their royal heritage, Romulus and Remus gathered support, overthrew Amulius, and restored Numitor to the throne. == Restoration and legacy == Numitor’s reign was restored following the defeat of Amulius by Romulus and Remus. Numitor’s support and blessings were instrumental in the establishment of Rome. Romulus, with Numitor's approval, went on to found the city of Rome, marking the beginning of Roman civilization. Numitor’s legacy continued through the founding of Rome, with his descendants considered among the city's first royal lineage. == Mythological significance == Numitor's story represents themes of loyalty, justice, and divine destiny, as he is seen as a rightful king restored to power through his grandsons. His lineage ties the origins of Rome to the ancient kings of Alba Longa, giving the Romans a noble heritage connected to both divine and royal ancestry. This myth served to reinforce Roman ideals of family honor and the importance of loyalty to one’s lineage. == Related pages == * Romulus and Remus * Rhea Silvia * Amulius * Alba Longa * Roman Kingdom == References == * Livy, Ab Urbe Condita (The History of Rome) * Virgil, Aeneid * Plutarch, Parallel Lives - \"The Life of Romulus\" Category:Italian people",
