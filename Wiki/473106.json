 "text": "West Bridgford is a small town in Nottinghamshire. The River Trent runs through it. The Trent Bridge cricket ground and the Nottingham Forest football ground are there. West Bridgford has a lot of independent cafes and supermarkets such as ASDA, Marks and Spencers and The Co-operative. West Bridgford is often called \"Bread and Lard Island\". It is called that because it is thought that the people who live there spend most of their money on big houses and fur coats, and can only afford to eat bread and lard at home.http://money.independent.co.uk/property/homes/article354181.ece ==References== Category:Towns in Nottinghamshire",
