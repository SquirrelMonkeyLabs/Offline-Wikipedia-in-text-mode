 "text": "\"Panthoibi Jagoi\" () (literally, \"Panthoibi's dance\" or \"Dance dedicated to the Divine Mother\") is a duet dance form, portraying the romantic love affairs between Nongpok Ningthou and Panthoibi. There are 14 hand gestures with bodily movements. It is performed in the religious festival of Lai Haraoba, depicting the weaving process. In the dance form, Marjing has been conflated with Nongpok Ningthou. Nowadays, the dance form is replaced by the Khamba Thoibi Jagoi. ==Related pages== * Thougal Jagoi * Laiching Jagoi ==References== Category:Art Category:Jagoi",
