His work directing for Aaagh! It's the Mr. Hell Show!, along with co-director Moose Pagen, was nominated for an Annie Award\"29th Annie Awards\" in 2001. He was shot and killed on August 13, 2007, by a police officer, Lee Chipperfield, in Vancouver. A video recorded by tourists showed Boyd being shot nine times after wielding a bicycle chain at officers who came to respond to a disturbance involving him. The ninth shot that struck Boyd was fired as he was on the ground. The officer who shot Boyd was cleared in the death. The use of force was criticized by many of Boyd's colleagues and relatives. ==References== ==Other websites== * *Interview with Boyd's sister, Deborah Category:1967 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Canadian animators Category:People with bipolar disorder Category:University of British Columbia alumni",
