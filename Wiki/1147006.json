 "text": "The Case Evaldo Rosa, also known as the Case of the 80 gunshots refers to the homicide of musician Evaldo Rosa dos Santos and recyclable material collector Luciano Macedo. On April 7, 2019, Evaldo Rosa dos Santos, a musician, was driving his car with his family in Guadalupe, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Soldiers from the Brazilian Army mistakenly believed his car was involved in a criminal activity and opened fire, shooting at the vehicle 80 times. Evaldo was killed, and a passerby named Luciano Macedo, who tried to help, was also shot and later died from his injuries. The soldiers claimed they thought Evaldoâ€™s car was part of a robbery, but investigations found inconsistencies in their statements. This incident drew significant public attention and raised concerns about the use of the military in public security operations in Brazil. == References == Category:Murders Category:Murders by firearm",
