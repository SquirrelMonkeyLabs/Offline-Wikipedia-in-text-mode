 "text": "A native speaker is someone who learned to speak a language as part of their childhood development. A native speaker's language is usually the language their parents speak and/or the language of their country of origin. It is the only language of a monolingual person, and likely the first language of a multilingual person which is acquired naturally in their native environment. It may serve as the basis for their sociolinguistic identity. A native speaker of a language has the following traits: # The speaker learnt the language in childhood, # mastery of idiomatic forms of the language, # comprehension of regional and social variance, # fluent, spontaneous production and comprehension of discourse. # Mastery of the grammar and vocabulary of the language tacitly. Many employers of language teachers prefer native speakers. == Alternative Perspectives on Native-Like Proficiency == While the traditional definition of a native speaker is tied to early childhood language acquisition, some linguistic researchers argue that native-like proficiency can be achieved later in life through full immersion and mastery. A speaker who meets the following criteria may be indistinguishable from a native speaker, despite learning the language beyond childhood: # Fluency and spontaneity in discourse, without hesitation. # Mastery of idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and regional variations. # Pronunciation and accent that align with native norms. # Tacit understanding of grammar and natural usage patterns. # Social and professional functionality identical to a native speaker. This perspective aligns with research in second language acquisition and the concept of near-native proficiency, where individuals acquire full linguistic competence comparable to those who learned the language as their first language. Studies in applied linguistics suggest that sustained immersion and high-level practice can result in functional nativeness, even if the language was not acquired from birth. While traditional definitions emphasize early exposure, some scholars advocate for a distinction between biological nativeness (acquired in childhood) and functional nativeness (achieved through extensive mastery). == Further reading == * Davies, A.
