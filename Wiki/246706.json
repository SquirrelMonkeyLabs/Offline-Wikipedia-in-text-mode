Jackson was shot dead in his home at 3 am. His wife, who before this had shot him in the chest, said that a burglar came into their house, tied her up, and shot him when he came home. Police said that nothing had been taken from the house, and Jackson's wallet was still on his body. Official investigations ruled out robbery. Police believe the person who shot Jackson was killed after a gun battle with police on July 15, 1976. ==References== Category:African-American musicians Category:American jazz musicians Category:American soul musicians Category:American murder victims Category:American drummers Category:Deaths by firearm in the United States Category:American funk musicians Category:Musicians from Memphis, Tennessee Category:1935 births Category:1975 deaths",
