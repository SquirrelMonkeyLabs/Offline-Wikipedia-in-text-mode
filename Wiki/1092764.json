Twenty- four people (twenty-three men and one woman) have been prime minister. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the governor general of Canada, but the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons. Normally, this is the leader of the party with the greatest number of seats in the house. A prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons. ==Prime ministers== In Canada, they count the individuals who were prime minister, not by terms.
