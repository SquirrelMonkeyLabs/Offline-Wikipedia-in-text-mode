 "text": "Sindhi language is spoken by more than 50 million people and Sindhi literature is as rich as of any language known to human society. Shah Abdul latif Bhittai, Sachal Sarmast and Sammi are considered as the legendary trio of Sindhi literature. Here in this discussion we concentrate on the Sindhi writers from India. This is quite possible that Sindh, presently part of Pakistan may appear in our discussion as this has passed only 70 years since the partition of the country which forced Indian Sindhi community to leave the motherland of many generations of their forefathers. Many of the contributors to Sindhi literature - Sindhi writers were born in Sindh though they live and worked in India. This might be the Rashtriya Kavi Padam Shri Dada Hundraj Dukhayal or unparalleled Sindhi writer poet Padma Shri Prof Ram Panjwani. When we are discussing about Sindhi writers we must mention Sindhi women. Sindhi literature has revolutionary woman writers like Popati Hiranandani [Sindhi Sahitya Academy Award 1982] , Indira Vaswani, Maya Rahi and many more who have contributed to enrich the Sindhi literature. Many of Sindhi women have contributed poetry. We will start list of Sindhi writers from India with Tirth Basant who wrote a biography of the famous Sindhi Saint Bhagat Kanwarram Sahib with Title \"Kanwar\" and was first awardee of Sindhi Sahitya Academy award in 1959.
