 "text": "There are 4 arrondissements in the Dordogne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The 4 arrondissements of Dordogne are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 241 Bergerac Bergerac 111,875 2,182.0 133 242 Nontron Nontron 40,508 1,621.0 100 243 Périgueux Périgueux 189,301 3,336.5 146 244 Sarlat-la-Canéda Sarlat-la-Canéda 74,666 1,920.6 141 ==History== Since its creation, the Dordogne department has had some changes: * 1790 : creation of the Dordogne department with nine districts: Belvès, Bergerac, Excideuil, Montignac, Montpon, Nontron, Périgueux, Ribérac and Sarlat.
