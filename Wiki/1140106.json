 "text": "Trifle is a type of English dessert. It is made by stacking layers of sponge cake, fruit and whipped cream inside of a glass dish. The sponge cake is soaked in sherry before being stacked into a trifle. Different ingredients can be added to a trifle, like chocolate or fruit jelly. == History == The oldest books describing trifle are English cookbooks from the 1500s. The oldest recipe for trifle comes from Thomas Dawson's cookbook The Good Huswifes Jewell, written in 1585. It was made by cooking cream, ginger, rose water and sugar into a custard. These earlier trifles, it is claimed, 'derived from the flavoured almond milk of medieval times'. Early trifles were originally a dessert made by mixing fruit and cream, but now the word \"trifle\" describes a dessert made with cake, cream and fruit. This modern type of trifle was invented in the 1750s. Recipes from that time describe trifle as sweet biscuits soaked in wine layered with custard and covered in a whipped milk. == References == Category:Desserts Category:British food",
