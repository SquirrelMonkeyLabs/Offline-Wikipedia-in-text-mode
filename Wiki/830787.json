If you really have to go there, here are some important things to remember to stay safe: # Don't go alone, especially at night. It's safer to have a friend with you, especially in places you don't know well. # Pay attention to what's around you. Stay away from dark or empty places because bad things can happen there. # Dress modestly and respectfully. This helps you fit in with the local people and not stand out too much. # Keep an eye on the news for protests and strikes. These can mess up your plans and might not be safe for you. # If you want to go to faraway places in Manipur, it's a good idea to get permission from the local authorities. This way, you can make sure you follow the rules and stay safe. # When you get to Manipur, go to the nearest police station and tell them you're there. This can really help in emergencies because they'll know where you are and can help if something goes wrong. ==References== Category:Manipur",
