The most significant engagements by this army in the 20th century were in Egypt's five wars with the State of Israel (in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1967–1970, and 1973). In one of those wars, the Suez Crisis of 1956, the army also struggled against the forces of Britain, and France. The Egyptian army also engaged in the North Yemen civil war, and the brief Libyan- Egyptian War in July 1977. Its last major engagement was Operation Desert Storm, the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation in 1991, in this operation, the Egyptian army was the second-largest of the allied forces.
