 "text": "In cricket, a player's bowling average is the number of runs for each wicket taken. The lower the bowling average is, the better the bowler is performing. It is one of a number of statistics used to compare bowlers. It is not used for bowlers who have not played a lot. George Lohmann (2 June 1865 â€“ 1 December 1901) holds the record for the lowest average in Test cricket, having claimed 112 wickets at an average of 10.75 runs per wicket. == References == Category:Cricket statistics",
