It was part of the U.S. \"War on Drugs.\" The campaign wanted to discourage children from using illegal drug(s) and offered various ways of saying \"no\". \"Just Say No\" was also used by other organizations, such as DARE, to discourage violence and premarital sex. The slogan was created by First Lady of the United States, Nancy Reagan. == Beginnings == The campaign started in the 1970s as part of the National Institutes of Health's program to stop drug abuse. It was started by Professor Richard I. Evans from the University of Houston.

In Breslow, L., Encyclopedia of Public Health (p. 1354). New York: Macmillan. While her husband ran to be President, Nancy Reagan joined this movement. In 1980, she visited Daytop Village in New York City. After her trip, she wanted teach youth about drugs and drug abuse. After her husband became the United States, she went back to Daytop Village.

Nancy Reagan first used the phrase in 1984 when she visited Longfellow Elementary School in Oakland, California. A schoolgirl asked what she should do if her friends or classmates offered her drugs.
