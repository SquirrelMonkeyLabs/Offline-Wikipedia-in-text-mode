 "text": "Milton Keynes Dons F.C. are an English football club. They are also known as MK Dons. They play their home games at a stadium called Stadium:MK which is in Milton Keynes (about 45 miles or 75 km north of London). The club began again in 2004 from the remains of Wimbledon F.C., which had moved to Milton Keynes in 2002 and then went bankrupt. The stadium now has a capacity of about 31,000 seats. == League highlights since 2004 == In the 2007/08 season, the Dons came top of Football League Two and won the Football League Trophy. They were promoted into Football League One. In the 2008/09 season, the Dons came third in League One, but failed to win the play-off between the next best three teams and themselves and so did not go up to the Football League Championship. So they stayed in League One for the 2009/10 season, they only reached 12th. On the last day of the 2014/15 season, they reached second in League One and so were promoted to the Championship for the 2015/16 season. Their stay in the Championship lasted just one season: they were relegated back to League One for the 2016/17 season. == League position == Season League Position 2004/05 League One 20th 2005/06 League One 22nd 2006/07 League Two 4th 2007/08 League Two Champions 2008/09 League One 3rd 2009/10 League One 12th 2010/11 League One 5th 2011/12 League One 5th 2012/13 League One 8th 2013/14 League One 10th 2014/15 League One 2nd 2015/16 Championship 23rd Category:English football clubs Category:Milton Keynes Category:2004 establishments in England",
