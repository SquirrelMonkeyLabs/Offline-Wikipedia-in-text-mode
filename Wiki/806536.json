FIMCAP was founded in 1962. == History == In 1959 youth organizations from France, Belgium and the Netherlands met. They discussed together how they can work together in the future. Based on these discussion they developed a joint plan. Following the plan they met again in Munich in 1960 at a big Catholic meeting.
