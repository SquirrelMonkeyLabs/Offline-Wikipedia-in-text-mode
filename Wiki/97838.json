 "text": "A movie projector is a machine that shows moving pictures by projecting them on a projection screen. Most of the optical and mechanical elements, except for the illumination and sound devices, are present in movie cameras. Many movie projectors use film and are called \"film projectors\". They are similar to slide projectors but with additional parts to keep the film moving at the correct speed. == Other websites == *Collection of restored cinema projectors and lighting by Regal Group, UK. *Film-Tech *American Wide Screen Museum *The story of the DP70 - The Todd-AO Projector *A Cinerama site Category:Optics Category:Movie industry",
