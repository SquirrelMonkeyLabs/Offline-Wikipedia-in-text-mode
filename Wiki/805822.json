 "text": "The diamonds affair, known in France as \"l'affaire des diamants\", was a major political scandal in the 5th French Republic. In 1973, the Minister of Finance, future president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, was offered two diamonds from the Emperor of the Central African Empire Bokassa I. The affair was revealed by satiric newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné on October 10, 1979, towards the end of Giscard's presidency. Many believe this was the reason for Giscard losing his 1981 reelection bid. ==References== Category:Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Category:1973 in Europe Category:1970s in France Category:Political scandals",
