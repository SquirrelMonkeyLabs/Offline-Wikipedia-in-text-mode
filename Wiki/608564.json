 "text": "Kamchatka Time, also known as Anadyr Time (ANAT) is a time zone in eastern Russia that is 12 hours ahead of UTC (UTC+12:00). It contains the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. Its summer time zone was Kamchatka Summer Time, or Anadyr Summer Time (ANAST) (UTC+13:00). On 28 March 2010, Kamchatka Time was eliminated, thus joining Magadan Time (UTC+11:00) and Magadan Summer Time (UTC+12:00). On 27 March 2011, Russia switched to daylight saving time permanently, so this time zone was at UTC+12:00 and when Russia switched to permanent standard time on 26 October 2014, this time zone was re- introduced.
