 "text": "Rice and curry is a popular dish in the Indian Subcontinent, as well as in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Rice and curry dinner has these dishes: * A vegetable curry, such as green beans, jackfruit or leeks. * A curry of meat, often chicken or fish; occasionally goat or lamb * Dhal, a dish of spiced lentils... and many more delicious varieties of this oriental cuisine respectively. The Southern cuisines use ingredients like dried fish which are local to the area. The spicier preparations are believed to be among the world's hottest in terms of chilli content (second only to Sylheti). While natives are born into this cuisine and develop a tolerance to spicy food, many visitors and tourists to the country often find the spiciness excessive. As a result, many local restaurants in developed and tourist areas offer special low-spice versions of local foods to cater to foreign palates, or have an alternative \"western\" menu for visitors and tourists.
