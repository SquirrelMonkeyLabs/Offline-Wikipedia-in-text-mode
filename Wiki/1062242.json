 "text": "The Sabireen Movement (, ), meaning the \"Movement of the Patient Ones,\" was a Palestinian Shia militant group. It formed in early 2014 when leaders in Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) converted to Shia Islam and became dissatisfied with PIJ's leadership. The group also disagreed with Hamas' stance on the Yemeni Civil War and Syrian Civil War, supporting the Saudi-led intervention and anti-government groups, respectively. The group was later destroyed by Hamas in 2019 and many of the members of the group joined Al-Quds Brigades. == References == Category:National liberation movements Category:Islamist militant groups",
