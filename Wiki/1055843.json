 "text": "The Gaza-Israel conflict is a long running dispute between the Gaza Strip (a Palestinian territory) and Israel. It revolves around political, territorial and security matters, and it has resulted in violence, wars, genocide and ongoing tensions. Key issues include border disputes, control of resources and the political self-determination of Palestinians in Gaza. An important background to note in this conflict is the Gaza blockade which is imposed by Israel and Egypt after Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 following the Fatah–Hamas conflict. The blockade restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, impacting the daily lives of its residents. International efforts tries to find a peaceful resolution, but this remains a complex and unresolved issue. Human Rights Watch have described the Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007, as an \"open-air prison\". == Related pages == * Israel–Hamas war (2023–present) * Blockade of the Gaza Strip ==References== Category:History of Palestine Category:Arab–Israeli conflict Category:Gaza genocide",
