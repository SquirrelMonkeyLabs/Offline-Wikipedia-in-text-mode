Some of the saloons offered dancing girls, some of them sometimes doubled as prostitutes. A lot of saloons offered poker, faro, brag, dice games, three-card monte, billiards, darts, and bowling. Some saloons included piano players, can-can girls, and theatrical skits. During his lifetime, Wyatt Earp owned and worked in many saloons. ==References== Category:American Old West Category:Places where alcohol is served",
