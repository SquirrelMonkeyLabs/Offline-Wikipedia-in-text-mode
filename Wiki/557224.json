 "text": "The Church of St. Anthony located in Jerzmanice-Zdrój, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland is a Roman Catholic church. The date of build is assessed on the 14th century. The scheme of the church is very untypical as a Lower Silesian customs building. Since 1527 until 1945 the church was used by Protestants. In 1945, after the World War II, the church was taken by the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic temple was significantly affected by the fight, that took place for example during the Thirty Years' War and Napoleonic campaigns.
