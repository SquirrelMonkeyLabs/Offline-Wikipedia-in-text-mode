The FATA were merged with the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in 2017. Miran Shah was the tribal capital. There are seven areas known as Agencies and six areas known as Frontier Regions. *Bajaur Agency *Khyber Agency *Kurram Agency *Mohmand Agency *Orakzai Agency *North Waziristan Agency *South Waziristan Agency == Frontier Regions == The Frontier Regions are named after their adjacent settled districts. The administration of the FR is carried out by the DCO / DC of the neighbouring named district. The overall administration of the frontier regions is carried out by the FATA Secretariat, based in Peshawar and reporting to the Governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The six regions are: *Frontier Region Bannu *Frontier Region Dera Ismail Khan *Frontier Region Kohat *Frontier Region Lakki Marwat *Frontier Region Peshawar *Frontier Region Tank (Jandola) == Geography == The FATA are bordered by: Afghanistan to the west with the border marked by the Durand Line, Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa to the north and east, and Balochistan to the south. The seven Tribal Areas lie in a north-to-south strip that is adjacent to the west side of the six Frontier Regions, which also lie in a north-to-south strip. The areas within each of those two regions are geographically arranged in a sequence from north to south. The geographical arrangement of the seven Tribal Areas in order from north to south is: Bajaur Agency, Mohmand Agency, Khyber, Orakzai Agency, Kurram, North Waziristan, South Waziristan. The geographical arrangement of the six Frontier Regions in order from north to south is: Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Tank, Dera Ismail Khan. == References == Category:Federally Administered Tribal Areas Category:Territories of Pakistan",
