 "text": "Public perception of mathematics includes the way in which people (not just mathematicians) perceive mathematics, and the public opinion of this science. The manner of public perception of mathematics is significant for many reasons, especially those related to education and social issues. In Italy, as in other European countries, the public perception of mathematics is negative and full of prejudice often related to how it is taught. == Education == Mathematics education plays a key role in the public perception of mathematics. The abstract part of mathematics makes the student feel to be bad at mathematics, while others see mathematics as hard and for \"intelligent people\". On these, Terence Tao tried to answer to the question \"does one have to be a genius to do mathematics?\" saying no. == Advocacy == Several groups have tried to change or improve the public perception of mathematics: In France, Animath changes the public perception of mathematics in France. MathsWorldUK tries to transform the United Kingdom public's perception of mathematics. == References == Category:Perception Category:Mathematics",
