 "text": "The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. It ended in April, that year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P; 500 Index, and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08. Markets over the following week (2–6 March) became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session (except for 6 March). On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war. This became known as Black Monday, and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008. Three days after Black Monday, there was another drop, Black Thursday, where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%. Stock market prices across most of the world were greater than or equal to their prices before the crash before the end of 2020. ==References== Category:February 2020 events Category:March 2020 events Category:April 2020 events Category:May 2020 events Category:COVID-19 pandemic",
