The album's cover has caused controversy, as it features a naked young girl. Some of the band members have said that the cover is okay, but others have said that they feel bad about releasing it. Some magazines and websites, such as Cracked and Gigwise.com, have called it one of the worst album covers of all time.\"The 15 Worst Album Covers of All-Time\" by Ben Dennison, Cracked\"The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers Of All Time!\", Gigwise.com, March 19, 2008 In 2008, the English Wikipedia page for Virgin Killer was put on a blacklist (a list of bad content) by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK organization.
