 "text": "Walter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 â€“ 22 January 1942) was a German-British painter and printmaker. He was a member of the Camden Town Group of Post- Impressionist artists in early 20th-century London. He was an important influence on British styles of avant-garde art in the mid- and late 20th century. His works were often about Jack the Ripper, which led some to believe he might have been the actual killer. ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Munich Category:German artists Category:British artists",
