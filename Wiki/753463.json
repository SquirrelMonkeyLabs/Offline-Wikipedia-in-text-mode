Grennan first found fame as a featured vocalist on Chase & Status' single \"All Goes Wrong\". The song was the \"Hottest Record\" on DJ Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show, giving Grennan a chance to experience the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge. Grennan is of partly Irish origin. He is a big fan of football and is a big supporter of Manchester United. At the age of 18, Grennan was mugged by a group of strangers on the street and was left with four metal plates and screws in his jaw that he has stated \"still hurt when winter comes\". == References == Category:1995 births Category:English singer-songwriters Category:English pop singers Category:English guitarists Category:English rock singers Category:Musicians from Bedfordshire Category:People from Bedford Category:Living people",
