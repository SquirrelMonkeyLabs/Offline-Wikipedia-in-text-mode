 "text": "G-flat major is a major scale based on G-flat. Its key signature has six flats. Its relative minor is E-flat minor, and its parallel minor is G-flat minor. This is usually replaced by F♯ minor because G♭ minor's two double- flats make it generally impractical to use. Its enharmonic equivalent is F-sharp major, whose key signature also has six accidentals. In writing music in E major for B-flat instruments, it is preferable to use a G-flat rather an F-sharp key signature. thumb|410px|Ascending and descending G-flat major scale.
