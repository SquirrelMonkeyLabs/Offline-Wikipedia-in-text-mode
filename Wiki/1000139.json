 "text": "An outpatient department or outpatient clinic is the part of a hospital for people with health problems who visit the hospital for diagnosis or treatment, but do not at this time need to stay in the hospital. Modern outpatient departments offer a wide range of treatment services, diagnostic tests and surgical procedures. In the past patients with long term problems would come regularly to these clinics, sometimes once a year and sometimes more often. The COVID-19 pandemic meant this was seen as dangerous, so there has been a big increase in the use of telephone, video and email to check up on people. There has also been a big increase in what is called patient-initiated follow- up appointments or PIFU. It is down to the patient to contact the hospital if they think they need medical help. Within the NHS there is now agreement that a “large proportion of patients can be managed without setting foot in a physical clinic”. == Related pages == *Virtual wards ==References== Category:Healthcare",
