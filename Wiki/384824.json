 "text": "Charter Communications is a cable system group begun in Delaware in 1993. They have Cable television, Internet and telephone services for over 26 million customers in 41 U.S. States. The Charter headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut, though many operations remain in St. Louis, Missouri. The company has gotten several awards. But like certain other providers, they have also been under criticism. In May 2016, Charter took over Time Warner Cable and the Bright House Networks; the three companies merged and then became Spectrum. ==References== Category:Companies based in Delaware Category:Television Category:1993 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Delaware",
