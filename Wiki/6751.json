He played the saxophone. He was a singer in London blues bands. He used the alias David Bowie because David Jones sounded too much like Davy Jones (of The Monkees). He took the name Bowie from Jim Bowie, who invented the Bowie knife. Bowie became known to the public with the 1969 song \"Space Oddity\". This single was released when man first landed on the moon. The song's title is based on the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick. In 1970, Bowie won an Ivor Novello Award for \"Space Oddity\". ==Career== ===Ziggy Stardust=== Bowie's album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was released in 1972. It is one of his best-known albums. As a result of his performance, Bowie became a leader of glam rock. Ziggy Stardust became Bowie's second personality (alter ego). For a press conference, he would show up as Ziggy. Bowie let Ziggy Stardust come to an end during a live concert in the Hammersmith Odeon theatre on 3 July 1973. In 1983, this show was released as movie and soundtrack (Ziggy Stardust – The Motion Picture). Bowie also produced Lou Reed's \"Transformer\".

With this band, Bowie recorded three albums: Tin Machine (1989), Tin Machine II (1991) and the live album Oy Vey, Baby (1992). ===1990s–2010s=== By the 1990s, Bowie had become more interested in soul, jazz and hip hop.
