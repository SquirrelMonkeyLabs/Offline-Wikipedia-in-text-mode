 "text": "Left-wing Youth is a Chinese youth community well-known for the 2018 Shenzhen Jasic worker rights protests. China's left-wing youth are mainly young college students born in the 1990s, and they are a very small minority among Chinese college students. These students are usually organized in the name of reading clubs and student societies, found in major universities, with different sizes and names. What these student organizations have in common is that they oppose Marxism as China's official ideology and advocate the \"rebellious revolution\" of Marxism. A key figure of the community is Yue Xin. == References == Category:Politics of the People's Republic of China Category:Political activists Category:Political movements",
