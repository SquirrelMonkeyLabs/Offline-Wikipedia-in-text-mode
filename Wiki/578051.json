Constandse studied Spanish at the University of Amsterdam. Although raised a Christian, he turned atheist. During World War II he was imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration camp, Gymnasium Beekvliet and Herzogenbusch concentration camp because of his anti-fascist and anti-nazi views. After the war he was editor at NRC Handelsblad. He wrote for De Groene Amsterdammer, Vrij Nederland, and various humanist, atheist and literary magazines. Furthermore, he spoke on the Dutch VPRO radio and lectured at the University of Amsterdam. Constandse was very negative about Christianity and later on also about Islam. He wrote a lot of books and brochures about atheism and anarchism. == References == * Socialhistory.org/bwsa * Resources.huygens.knaw.nl == Other websites == * www.dbnl.org Category:1899 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Anarchists Category:Dutch academics Category:Dutch activists Category:Dutch atheists Category:Dutch former Christians Category:Dutch journalists Category:Dutch people of World War II Category:Humanists Category:Writers from Zeeland",
