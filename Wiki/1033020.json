 "text": "The Laoshan tree frog (Rhacophorus laoshan) is a frog. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: 1389 meters above sea level in Cenwangloashan Nature Reserve in China. The adult frog is about 35 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color with a sideways stripe. The belly is gray-brown in color. The insides of the back legs are bright orange like a tangerine fruit. This frog lives in forests with high trees and bamboo plants growing to under the trees. The scientists named this frog after Cenwanglaoshan Natural Preserve because that was where they found it. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
