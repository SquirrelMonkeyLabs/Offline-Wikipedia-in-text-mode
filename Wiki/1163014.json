 "text": "Allobates subfolionidificans is a frog. It lives in the state of Acre in Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives in the Amazon. It can live in forests that have never been cut down and in forestst that are growing back. Scientists have seen the frog 136 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in protected parks: Área de Proteção Ambiental Igarapé São Francisco, Área de Proteção Raimundo Irineu Serra, and Parque Zoobotânico da Universidade Federal do Acre. ==Young== The male frog sits on leaves or branches in the dead leaves on the ground. The female frog lays her eggs on the undersides of leaves between 0 and 10 cm above the ground. She lays one group of eggs in each place. There are 8-10 eggs in each group. The eggs are white in color. The tadpoles live on the undersides of the leaves for a while. Then the male frog carries them to water, where they swim and grow into frogs. Each male frog can have more than one group of eggs. They average 1-3 groups per season. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it can only live in forests. In eastern Acre, people cut down forests to make towns and farms. This can hurt the frogs in those places. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
