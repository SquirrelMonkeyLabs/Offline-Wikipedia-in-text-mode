 "text": "Hoop Dogz is an American computer-animated Christian series designed for children, consisting of four direct-to-video installments that teach the Ten Commandments through dogs playing basketball. Created by Doug creator Jim Jinkins at Cartoon Pizza, the series aims to present biblical principles in a kid appealing manner. == Overview == Each episode addresses a specific commandment through humorous and moral stories featuring anthropomorphic dog characters. Created by Jim Jinkins, renowned for his work on popular series such as Doug and PB&J; Otter, Hoop Dogz was produced by Cartoon Pizza, a Nashville-based studio also known for shows like JoJo's Circus and Stanley. The series was developed with the intent of providing children with Christian moral lessons rooted in biblical teachings, delivered in a format that is both engaging and accessible. Jim Jinkins, the creator, has a background in producing family-friendly content, including \"The Beginners Bible\" series in the 1990s. He has emphasized that the series aims to reflect God's desire for human happiness through adherence to the commandments. The show's characters, such as Chad Dimple and Rebecca Ruth, are comedic parodies of adult figures, designed to resonate with both children and parents. Initially designed as a 2D series, Hoop Dogz was transformed into a hybrid 2.5D/3D animation during production. The characters are drawn with flat, cartoonish designs, set in a semi-urban setting called Wobble Hill, which combines simple backgrounds with three-dimensional character movement and camera angles. == Episodes == 1\\.
