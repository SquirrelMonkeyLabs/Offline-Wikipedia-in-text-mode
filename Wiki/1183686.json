 "text": "Most Hindus live in Asian countries. The majority of people in Nepal, India, and Bali are Hindus, and Hindus are the largest group in Mauritius, though not a majority. A lot of Hindus have moved from Southeast Asia to other parts of the world over the past 200 years. Countries with more than 500,000 Hindus, from most to least, are: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the United States, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Myanmar, Australia, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. There are significant numbers of Hindu enclaves around the world, with many in South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Hinduism is also practiced by the non-Indic people including the Balinese of Bali island (Indonesia), Tengger and Osing of Java (Indonesia), the Balamon Chams of Vietnam, and Butuanon people in Philippines. == Background == Hinduism is a mixed religion with many different ways of thinking. It has many ideas about spirituality and traditions, but it does not have one main church, one unquestionable leader, one ruling group, one prophet, or one single holy book that everyone must follow. Hindus can believe in many gods, one god, that god is everything, that everything is one, or they can be agnostic, humanist, or even atheist.Julius J. Lipner, Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, , page 8; Quote: “(...) one need not be religious in the minimal sense described to be accepted as a Hindu by Hindus, or describe oneself perfectly validly as Hindu. One may be polytheistic or monotheistic, monistic or pantheistic, even an agnostic, humanist or atheist, and still be considered a Hindu\".; MK Gandhi, The Essence of Hinduism , Editor: VB Kher, Navajivan Publishing, see page 3; According to Gandhi, \"a man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu.\" == Early Migration == One of the first big waves of Hindus leaving South Asia happened because of colonialism in India during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Many Hindus moved far away under work contracts to places like Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad, Mauritius, South Africa, East Africa, Fiji, Burma, and Malaysia. These were some of the first countries where Hinduism was set up outside of India, and many of them still have strong Hindu communities today. as well as US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report 2006. India has the most Hindus by number. By percentage, Nepal has the highest share of Hindus, followed by India and Mauritius. As of 2020, there are about 1.2 billion Hindus in the world, making Hinduism the third-largest religion after Christianity and Islam. Almost 1.1 billion Hindus live in India, which is about 94% of all Hindus worldwide. A study says about 100 million Hindus live outside India. In 2010, only two countries — Nepal and India — had Hindu majorities. In Mauritius, about 47.9% of the people were Hindu according to the 2022 census. == By country == Sources used for the table below include the US State Department, the CIA World Factbook, adherents.com, thearda.com, and Pew Research Center. and as identified.
