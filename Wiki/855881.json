 "text": "The Crow is a superhero movie directed by Alex Proyas. It was released in 1994, and is based on the comic with the same name. The movie featured Brandon Lee, the son of Bruce Lee. When the movie was made, in 1993, there was an accident at the set, which killed Brandon Lee. Because of this accident, it was unclear, if the movie would be released. After Lee had died, some scenes needed to be re-done, which was expensive and controversial at the time. The movie had good reviews. There were three sequels, and a TV series. About four years later, Proyas created another movie, with the same creative director, Alex McDowell: Dark City. It was also based on a comic, and had a similarly somber theme. ==References== Category:1994 fantasy movies Category:American fantasy movies Category:British fantasy movies Category:Movies directed by Alex Proyas Category:Movies set in North Carolina Category:Movies about revenge Category:Vigilante movies",
