 "text": "Johann Michael Neder (29 April 1807 – 30 September 1882) was an Austrian painter. Neder was born in Vienna, and spent most of his life there. His paintings were done in the style of the Biedermeier. Today he is mostly known for portraits and genre paintings. Most of his work shows the life of the Viennese bourgeoisie in the suburbs of Vienna. For this reason, it is also important from a documentary point of view. == Gallery == File:Johann Michael Neder, Selbstbildnis.jpg|Self portrait, created around 1854 File:Michael Neder - Morgentoilette eines Mädchens - 5112 - Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.jpg|Young girl in the morning File:Johann Michael Neder - Calf in the Barn with Farmer and his Wife.jpg|Calf in the Barn with Farmer and his Wife (1867) File:Michael Neder-Alte Frau mit weißer Bluse.jpg|Old woman in a white blouse Category:1807 births Category:1882 deaths Category:Austrian painters Category:People from Vienna",
