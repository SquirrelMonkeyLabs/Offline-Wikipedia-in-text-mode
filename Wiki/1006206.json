 "text": "The jade tree frog or Dulit flying frog (Zhangixalus dulitensis) is a frog. It lives in Borneo. It lives no more than 250 meters above sea level. People do not see this frog much because it lives high in the place where the tree branches come together like a roof. They come to the ground when it is time to lay eggs. People have seen this frog no higher than 300 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because there are so many of them alive. People sometimes cut down the forests where the frog lives to make farms to make palm oil. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
