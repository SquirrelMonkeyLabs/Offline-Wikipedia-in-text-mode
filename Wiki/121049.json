The male has a bright silvery-blue dorsal wing outlined in a narrow line of black, while the female’s dorsal wing is a more brownish-gray color. Both males and females have gray ventral wings with dark spots surrounded by white rings. 1987\\. Decline of the Endangered Palos Verdes blue Butterfly in California. Biological Conservation. 40: 203–217. == Conservation == G. lygdamus palosverdesensis was listed as an endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service on July 2, 1980. Insects are not currently protected by California law. The main threat to the Palos Verdes blue has been the destruction of their living space by weeds, which has negative effects on the larval foodplants needed. ==References== Category:Endangered species Category:Lycaenidae",
