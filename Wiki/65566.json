It is approximately 1,450 miles (2,330 km) long. It drains a part of the dry regions on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains. The natural course of the river flows into the Gulf of California. The heavy use of the river as an irrigation source for the Imperial Valley has desiccated the lower course of the river in Mexico. Now it no longer always reaches the sea. On its way the Colorado River runs through Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, California and Mexico. The Colorado River drains 242,900 sq mi (629,100 km²). Total flows of the river range from 4000 cubic feet per second (570 m³/s) in droughts to 1,000,000 ft³/s (28,000 m³/s) in severe floods. With the construction of massive power dams on the lower course of the river, floods of over 70,000 ft³/s (2000 m³/s) are rare. The mean flow of the total river before diversion is 22,000 ft³/s. Historically, the flow was much higher before water usage began in the basin. == References == Category:Rivers of Mexico Category:Rivers of Arizona Category:Rivers of Colorado Category:Rivers of Utah Category:Geography of Nevada Category:Rivers of California Category:Imperial County, California Category:Geography of Riverside County, California Category:Geography of San Bernardino County, California",
