 "text": "Education in Cuba has been a high priority for the government for many years. The University of Havana was founded in 1727. There are also some well- established colleges and universities. For the 1959 revolution, the Castro government nationalized all educational institutions. They created a system operated completely by the government. Their strong ideological content is present. Also the constitution states that educational and cultural policy is based on Marxist ideology. According to UNESCO, Cuba spends about 10 percent of its budget on education. This is compared with 4 percent in the United Kingdom and 2 percent in the United States. ==References== ==Other websites== *Cuban Education in Figures, 1958-2000 *Information on education in Cuba from Cuba-Junky.com *Cuban ministry for Education website *Photos of Cuban education Cuba Category:Cuba Category:Education in North America",
