 "text": "Steak tartare is a dish which is produced using finely chopped or ground meat of beef or horse. In Belgium and Luxembourg the dish is called filet am√©ricain. The meat used for producing steak tartare is usually of a very high quality. The name refers to the Tatars, who are said to have had meat under their saddle when riding. Because the dish is usually eaten raw, there are health concerns: The meat may have been contaminated with bacteria or parasites. These risks can be reduced when following basic rules of hygiene and by using fresh meat. ==References== Category:Meat dishes",
