 "text": "Mizo is a language from the Tibeto-Burman family. It is mostly spoken in the Indian state of Mizoram, where it is both the official language and the most commonly used one. The Mizo people speak this language as their mother tongue, and even those from Mizo communities living outside Mizoram also use it. Besides Mizoram, Mizo is also spoken in other parts of India like Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, and Assam. Outside India, people speak Mizo in the Sagaing Region and Chin State of Myanmar, and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. The language is mainly based on the Lusei dialect, but it also includes words from other Mizo clans such as Hmar, Pawi, and others. This gives the language a mix of vocabulary from different Mizo groups. The language is also known as Duhlian and Lushai, a colonial term, as the Duhlian people were the first among the Mizo people to be encountered by the British in the course of their colonial expansion.Lalthangliana, B., 'Mizo tihin á¹­awng a nei lo' tih kha , see also Matisoff, 'Language names' section == References == Category:Languages of India Category:Languages of Bangladesh",
