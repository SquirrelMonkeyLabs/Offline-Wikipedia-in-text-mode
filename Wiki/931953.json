He is the deputy leader of the Liberal Party since 2018 and was the Member of Parliament for Kooyong from 2010 to 2022. He also worked for Deutsche Bank until his election to Parliament in 2010. On 24 August 2018, he was elected Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. In February 2022, a Roy Morgan poll showed he was the front runner to be Morrison's potential replacement as leader of the Liberal Party among voters. However, at the 2022 election, Frydenberg lost his seat to the teal independent candidate Monique Ryan. In July 2022, Frydenberg started working at Goldman Sachs as a senior advisor for the Asia Pacific region. In September 2023, he became the chairman of Goldman Sachsâ€™ operations in Australia and New Zealand. Because of this new job, Frydenberg decided not to run for the Kooyong seat in 2025. In May 2024, Frydenberg looked at the rise of antisemitism in a Sky News Australia documentary called Never Again: The Fight Against Antisemitism. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Bankers Category:Politicians from Melbourne Category:Liberal Party of Australia politicians",
