 "text": "The House of Commons of Great Britain was the lower house of the Parliament of Great Britain between 1707 and 1801. This was a result of the Acts of Union. It replaced the House of Commons of England and the third estate of the Parliament of Scotland. This was one of the most significant changes brought about by the Union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801, the House was enlarged to become the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, as a result of the Act of Union of 1800 which combined Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. ==Parliamentary constituencies== The constituencies which elected members in England and Wales did not change throughout the existence of the Parliament of Great Britain.
