 "text": ":For the electrical device that produces light, see Lightbulb. A bulb is the part of some plants that is mostly under the dirt and stores food while the plant rests from growing. Some well-known bulbs people grow to use as food are onions and garlic. Some bulbs grown for the decorative flowers are lilies, tulips, and some irises. Some plant storage organs that are similar to bulbs but have different names are tubers, corms (swollen stems), tuberous roots, and pseudobulbs. Category:Plant anatomy",
