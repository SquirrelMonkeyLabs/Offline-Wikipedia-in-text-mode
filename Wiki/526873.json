Aloha was released on May 29, 2015. ==Reviews== The movie got negative reviews from critics. It has a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Aloha was also a box office bomb and only made $26.3 million from its $37 million budget. The Hollywood Reporter estimated that the movies financial losses were close to $65 million by the time the movie ended its run in theatres. The movie was criticized by Media Action Network for Asian-Americans for \"whitewashing\" the cast. Director Cameron Crowe said in a response: \"I have heard your words and your disappointment, and I offer you a heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice. As far back as 2007, Captain Allison Ng was written to be a super-proud one quarter Hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one. A half-Chinese father was meant to show the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent in Hawaii. Extremely proud of her unlikely heritage, she feels personally compelled to over-explain every chance she gets. The character was based on a real-life, red-headed local who did just that.\" Emma Stone said that whitewashing was a problem in Hollywood and that she regretted being miscast. == Cast == * Bradley Cooper as Brian Gilcrest * Emma Stone as Captain Allison Ng * Rachel McAdams as Tracy Woodside * Bill Murray as Carson Welch * John Krasinski as John \"Woody\" Woodside * Danny McBride as Colonel \"Fingers\" Lacy * Alec Baldwin as General Dixon * Bill Camp as Bob Largent * Michael Chernus as Roy * Jaeden Lieberher as Mitchell * Danielle Rose Russell as Grace * Edi Gathegi as Lieutenant Colonel Curtis * Bumpy Kanahele as himself ==References== == Other websites == * Category:2015 comedy-drama movies Category:2015 romantic comedy movies Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:2010s English-language movies Category:Movies directed by Cameron Crowe Category:20th Century Fox movies",
