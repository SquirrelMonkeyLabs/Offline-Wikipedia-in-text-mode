 "text": "The term \"headquarters\" refers to the main building or location of an organization where a majority of its functions are made. Large corporations typically have headquarters that oversee and control their business operations. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also have headquarters buildings where their activities are managed. In the context of law enforcement, headquarters for agencies can be found in large buildings located within cities, towns, counties, or states, serving as the central hub for their operations. For example, some fire departments may have their headquarters situated within a fire station to accommodate administrative staff and operational units. Alternatively, many fire departments have separate headquarters buildings dedicated to administrative functions. In military contexts, the term is similarly applied. In the United States Military, all units within the Army and Marine Corps have buildings for their headquarters staff, which handle administrative responsibilities for companies, battalions, regiments, and other military units.
