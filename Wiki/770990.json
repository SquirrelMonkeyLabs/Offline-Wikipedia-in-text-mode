It removed all of the federal government's control over such areas as fares, routes, and market entry of new airlines. It introduced a free market in the commercial airline business and led to a great increase in the number of flights, a decrease in fares, an increase in the number of passengers and miles flown, and a consolidation of carriers.Continental Air Lines, Inc. v.
