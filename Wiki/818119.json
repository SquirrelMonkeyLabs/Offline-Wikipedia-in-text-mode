 "text": "National Foundation Day (建国記念の日, Kenkoku Kinen no Hi) is a national holiday in Japan celebrated annually on 11 February. It celebrates the legendary foundation of Japan, and the accession of its first emperor, Emperor Jimmu, at Kashihara gū. ==History== According to Shinto tradition, Emperor Jimmu ascended the throne in 660 BC. During the Meiji period, historians said this was 11 February 660 BC. The holiday was celebrated for the first time in 1873 AD. They called it the National Empire Day. Historians believe that the Meiji government did this to make the Meiji Emperor look like a successor of Emperor Jimmu. The Meiji-era constitution was announced on February 11 1889. After the occupation ended, nationalist groups in Japan tried to convince the government to bring back the holiday. After a few years, they did. They called it National Foundation Day instead of National Empire Day and removed most of the imperial imagery. Today, some groups in Japan like National Foundation Day and other groups protest it because they think it is too close to the actions that led up to World War II. == Related pages == * Japanese imperial year * National Day == References== Category:National days Category:Festivals in Japan Category:February events",
