 "text": "The name Principality of the Pindus or Principality of Pindos has been used, mainly to describe an attempt to form an autonomous district in the Pindus mountains in northern Greece in July, and August 1917. At that time, near the end of the World War I, mayors and sd other leaders from several Vlach villages in the Pindus mountain, including Samarina, Avdella and Metsovo, wanted to create an autonomous protectorate of Italy.Evenimentele din lunile iulie-august 1917 în regiunea Munţilor Pind – încercare de creare a uneistatalităţi a aromânilor. documente inedite şi mărturii. studiu istoriografic şi arhivistic , Stoica Lascu, Revista Romana de Studii Eurasiatice, Anul III, Nr. 1-2/2007 This effort was not successful. Neither a principality, autonomous State, or autonomous district ever actually came into existence in 1917. All these events lasted only a few days. One of the members of the temporary committee that wanted to form a government for this district was the young Alcibiades Diamandi, an ethnic-Aromanian who played a significant role 25 years later in 1941–43. The name \"Principality of the Pindus\" was used later to describe a similar idea which was discussed by members of the \"Roman Legion\" (1941-1943). This \"Roman Legion\" was a group of Vlachs working together with the Italian army that occupied Greece during part of World War II.Τα παιδιά της λύκαινας.
