 "text": "The No Child Left Behind Act is a United States law that was to help students meet higher standards. This law started during President George W. Bush's time in the White House. President Bush made the law official on January 8, 2002. Schools around the US now have to test their students. If they don't, the schools risk losing funds given to them by the federal government. Some parts of this rule include bilingualism standards. All students must be on at least a proficient level (B+) by the 2013â€“14 school year. Since the law started, Congress gave more money to schools from $42.2 billion in 2001 to $54.4 billion in 2007. No Child Left Behind received a 40.4% increase from $17.4 billion in 2001 to $24.4 billion. The funding for reading quadrupled from $286 million in 2001 to $1.2 billion.U.S. Department of Education.
