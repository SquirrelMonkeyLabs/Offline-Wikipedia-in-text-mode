On January 19, 2018, Drake posted on his Instagram and confirmed the mixtape's title, album art, and the release date of midnight. It was Drake's first music release since the release of his fifth mixtape More Life on March 18, 2017. The album's cover art is the words Scary Hours in a vertical direction, layered over each other and over a black background. The album's artwork caused some controversy after designer Collin Fletcher claimed that Drake and OVO plagiarized the work from a poster he made for an artist named Rabit. It was reported by Billboard that OVO Sound, Drake's record label, chose the artwork from many options and did not have prior knowledge of it being an already used work. The album is the first in the Scary Hours series released by Drake. A sequel to the EP titled Scary Hours 2 was released on March 5, 2021. The album features the songs \"God's Plan\" and \"Diplomatic Immunity\". ==Songs== ==References== Category:2018 albums Category:Drake (musician) albums Category:Cash Money Records albums Category:Young Money Entertainment albums",
