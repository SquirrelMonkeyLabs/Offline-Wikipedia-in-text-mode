 "text": "Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) are inclusions found in carbonaceous chondrites. These inclusions are about long. They are light-colored and made of calcium and aluminum. High-temperature minerals are often found in CAIs. These objects are among the first solid objects to be created by the cooling of a protoplanetary disk. CAIs are formed at much higher temperatures than the associated chondrules. They may have survived many high-temperature events while most chondrules are created in a single melting event. The isotopic anomalies of CAIs give important information about the creation of the solar system. The studying of them suggests that the solar nebula collapsed soon after a nearby supernova. Radiometric dating shows that the CAIs formed about 2 million years before the chondrules formed. ==References== * Gilmour J. 2002.
