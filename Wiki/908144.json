 "text": "The Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) is a species of torpedo- shaped squid. It is mostly found in the Caribbean sea and sometimes found off the coast of Florida. They are found in schools (groups) of about thirty at a time. Baby squids live closer to the shore than the older ones. The squid can eat 30-60% of their body weight daily. The Caribbean reef squid uses its beak to cut their food up so that it is easier to process. They communicate using the colors of their body as well as shape and texture. ==References== Category:Animals of North America Category:Cephalopods",
