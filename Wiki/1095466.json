 "text": "Theophany is a word that means the appearance of a deity. The deity will manifest itself in an observable and tangible form. It is different from other types of encounters with a deity; these interactions are not considered theophanies unless the deity reveals itself in a visible form. Traditionally, the term \"theophany\" was usedfor appearances of the gods in ancient Greek and Near Eastern religions. While the Iliad is the earliest source for descriptions of theophanies in classical antiquity, the first description appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh. == References == Category:Theology",
