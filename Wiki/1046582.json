 "text": "Raorchestes manohari is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it between 900 and 1300 meters above sea level on a Kadalar tea farm in the Western Ghat mountains. The adult frog is about 17.57 - 18.06 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is bright yellow. It is bumpy, not smooth. There are brown-black spots on its back. The sides of the frog's body are lighter yellow in color. The frog's belly is white in color. Scientists saw the frog on reed plants in the species Ochlandra travancorica on farms and in forests. Scientists think the frogs need the reeds to live. The frog lays eggs in bamboo plants. The frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
