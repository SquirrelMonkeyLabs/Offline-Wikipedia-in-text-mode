While they take pictures, their camel drinks from a barrel of beer. As Minnie is taking a picture of Mickey, a sultan grabs her and takes her away. Mickey tries to chase them, but the camel is drunk and slow. Mickey finds the sultanâ€™s palace. He climbs the wall and gets inside through a window. He finds Minnie, who is trying to get away from the sultan. Mickey helps her escape and hides her in a flower pot. The sultan and his guards try to stop Mickey, but he gets away. Mickey runs with the flower pot, holding it carefully. The sultan chases him up the stairs and across rooftops. Mickey drops the pot, but catches Minnie just in time. They both fall onto an awning. The angry sultan jumps too, but Mickey pulls the awning away. The sultan falls and lands on spears thrown by his own guards. He runs away in pain. Mickey calls the camel, and he and Minnie ride away happily. ==Voice actors== * Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney * Minnie Mouse: Marcellite Garner * Pete: Billy Bletcher ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:Disney animated movies Category:Short movies Category:Movies directed by Wilfred Jackson",
