The speed and rate of rotation of the fluid are greatest at the center and become smaller with distance from the center. ==Related pages== * Vorticity * Wormhole ==Other websites== *Dust Devil Movie A short movie showing many spinning vortices of varying sizes *Video of two water vortex rings colliding (MPEG) *BubbleRings.com Web site on \"bubble rings\", which are underwater rings made of air formed from vortices. The site has some information on how these rings work. *Chapter 3 Rotational Flows: Circulation and Turbulence *Video of Vortex Formation and Annihilation in a Superconductor (By Joel Thorarinson ) Category:Fluid mechanics",
