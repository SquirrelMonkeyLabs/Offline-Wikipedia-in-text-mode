 "text": "Rashid Rida was a Salafist Islamic scholar who called for the revival of the study of hadith and supported the idea of a Islamic state. He believed that reform was needed to save Muslims from Sufism and start a Islamic revival. He supported the idea of a armed jihad in the Muslim world against imperialists. During the 1900s, Rida started to be influenced by Wahhabism and Ahl-i Hadith and started to follow a more conservative interpretation of Salafism. == References == Category:Muslim scholars Category:1935 deaths Category:1865 births Category:Articles with bare URLs for citations from August 2024 Category:All articles with bare URLs for citations Category:Articles containing Arabic-language text",
