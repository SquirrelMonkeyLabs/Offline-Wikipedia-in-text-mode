 "text": "Racialization is a descriptive sociological theory that explains how people in power group, sort, and define others by race or ethnicity to dismiss their rights and limit their freedoms and life chances. It shows how hurtful stereotypes or negative ideas are forced on certain groups repeatedly to keep them from having equal access to jobs, public services, housing, education, and protection under the law. ==History == In the United States in the mid-1800s, there were laws called the Black Codes. These laws were made to stop Black Americans from having the same legal, political, and civic rights as white people. They were created by the dominant group to keep Black people from gaining a fair place in society or fair treatment. Racialization in the 21st century continues through social processes like gatekeeping, where people are blocked from getting good education or jobs. It happens in redlining, where banks or insurance companies refuse or limit services based on race. It also happens when false or negative views about certain racial groups are spread online, or when community service centers give racialized groups wrong or not enough information about public services and programs. ==Racial gaslighting== Racialization is often denied by dominant groups and those who follow the dominant group's way of thinking through racial gaslighting. This is when people in a society try to dismiss or deny the reality of racial unfairness. It makes racialized people doubt their own personal experiences. When this happens to people of African descent, it is called racelighting. ==Further reading== * * ==Related pages== * Racism * Afrophobia * Antiziganism * Antisemitism ==References== Category:Bias Category:Racism Category:Culture Category:Society Category:Discrimination",
