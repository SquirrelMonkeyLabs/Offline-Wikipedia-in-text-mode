 "text": "In probability theory, conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has occurred. Usually this is written as P(A\\mid B). This is read as \"probability of A given B\". The two events need not be related. They also need not occur at the same time. In the most general case, P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)} Expressed in words: The conditional probability of A occurring given B is the probability of both events occurring, divided by the probability of B occurring. As a division by zero is not defined, the probability of B occurring must not be zero. Category:Probability theory",
