 "text": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a 1992 American action/comedy fantasy movie about a cheerleader (Kristy Swanson) chosen by fate to fight and kill vampires. The movie is a light parody. It goes against the clich√©s of horror movies. The movie led to a darker and much more popular TV series of the same name. The television series starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and was created and produced by screenwriter Joss Whedon. Whedon often said how the television series was more like his vision than the movie. When the movie was first released, it was moderately successful and received mixed reviews from critics. ==Related pages== * Buffy the Vampire Slayer ==References== == Other websites == * * Category:1992 comedy movies Category:1992 action movies Category:1992 fantasy movies Category:1990s American action movies Category:1990s American fantasy movies Category:American teen comedy movies Category:1990s English-language movies Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Screenplays by Joss Whedon Category:20th Century Fox movies Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer",
