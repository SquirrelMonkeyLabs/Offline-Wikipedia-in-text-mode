 "text": "The Canebrake tree frogs (Aplastodiscus) are a group of frogs in the family Hylidae. They live in southeastern Brazil near the Atlantic Ocean. One frog, Aplastodiscus pervirdis, also lives in Argentina, and it might live in Paraguay. At first, Aplastodiscus had two frog species in it. In 2005, frog scientists looked at Hylidae again and decided that 12 more frogs should go into Aplastodiscus. They moved them into Aplastodiscus from Hyla. Now, there are 16 species in Aplastodiscus. ==Species== There are currently 16 species in Aplastodiscus: * Aplastodiscus albofrenatus (A. Lutz, 1924) * Aplastodiscus albosignatus (A. Lutz and B. Lutz, 1938) * Aplastodiscus arildae (Cruz and Peixoto, 1987) * Aplastodiscus cavicola (Cruz and Peixoto, 1985) * Aplastodiscus cochranae (Mertens, 1952) * Aplastodiscus ehrhardti (MÃ¼ller, 1924) * Aplastodiscus eugenioi (Carvalho-e-Silva and Carvalho-e-Silva, 2005) * Aplastodiscus flumineus (Cruz and Peixoto, 1985) *Aplastodiscus heterophonicus () * Aplastodiscus ibirapitanga (Cruz, Pimenta, and Silvano, 2003) * Aplastodiscus leucopygius (Cruz and Peixoto, 1985) * Aplastodiscus lutzorum (Berneck, Giaretta, Brandao, Cruz & Haddad, 2017) * Aplastodiscus musicus (B. Lutz, 1949) * Aplastodiscus perviridis (A. Lutz in B. Lutz, 1950) * Aplastodiscus sibilatus (Cruz, Pimenta, and Silvano, 2003) * Aplastodiscus weygoldti (Cruz and Peixoto, 1987) == Threats == Currently, none of the species are in danger of dying out. But there are fewer of some frogs than others. Human beings change the places where they live to build houses, farms, and towns. Pollution, climate change, and disease can also hurt these frogs. Some invasive species can kill this frog. Many of the species are data deficient. That means that scientists do not know enough about them to know if they are in danger or not. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
