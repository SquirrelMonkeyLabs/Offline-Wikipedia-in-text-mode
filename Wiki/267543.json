 "text": "Peter Clay Carroll (born September 15, 1951, in San Francisco, California) is the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, a National Football League team. He used to coach for the New York Jets, New England Patriots and the University of Southern California football team. In his time at USC, the Trojans went to two BCS Bowl games, winning the National Championship in 2004 and winning the Pacific-10 Conference football title seven years in a row from 2002 to 2008. The 2004 BCS title was taken away from the team in 2010, but USC kept its 2003 and 2004 AP National Championships. ==Early life== Carroll went to Redwood High School in Larkspur, California. Carroll played in three sports: football (playing quarterback, wide receiver and defensive back), basketball and baseball. Carroll won the school's Athlete of the Year award in 1969. ==College== After high school, Carroll went to junior college (a two-year college) at College of Marin, where he played football for two years before changing schools to the University of the Pacific. At Pacific, Carroll played the free safety position for two years. After graduation, Carroll tried out for the Honolulu Hawaiians of the World Football League, but did not make the team because of shoulder problems. To make money, he found a job selling roofing materials in the Bay Area, but he found he was not good at it and soon moved on; it would be his only non-football-related job. ==Head coaching record== ===National Football League=== Team Year Regular season Postseason Won Lost Ties Win % Finish Won Lost Win % Result NYJ 1994 6 10 0 5th in AFC East — — — — NYJ total 6 10 0 .375 — — — NE 1997 10 6 0 1st in AFC East 1 1 Lost to Pittsburgh Steelers in AFC Divisional Game NE 1998 9 7 0 4th in AFC East 0 1 Lost to Jacksonville Jaguars in AFC Wild-Card Game NE 1999 8 8 0 5th in AFC East — — — — NE total 27 21 0 1 2 SEA 2010 7 9 0 1st in NFC West 1 1 Lost to Chicago Bears in NFC Divisional Game SEA 2011 7 9 0 3rd in NFC West — — — — SEA 2012 11 5 0 2nd in NFC West 1 1 Lost to Atlanta Falcons in NFC Divisional Game SEA 2013 13 3 0 1st in NFC West 3 0 Super Bowl XLVIII champions SEA 2014 12 4 0 1st in NFC West 2 1 Lost to New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX SEA 2015 10 6 0 2nd in NFC West 1 1 Lost to Carolina Panthers in NFC Divisional Game SEA 2016 10 5 1 1st in NFC West 1 1 Lost to Atlanta Falcons in NFC Divisional Game SEA 2017 9 7 0 2nd in NFC West — — — — SEA total 79 48 1 9 5 Total 112 79 1 10 7 ==References== == Other websites== * * USC profile Category:National Football League coaches Category:Sportspeople from San Francisco Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:San Francisco 49ers Category:College football coaches",
