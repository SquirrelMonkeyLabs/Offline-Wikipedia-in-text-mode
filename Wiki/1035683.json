 "text": "The yellow-bellied bush frog or Malabar bubble-nest frog (Raorchestes flaviventris) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat Mountains, between 1249 and 1900 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests with evergreen trees. It lives 2-4 meters over the ground. People have also seen it in cardamom farms but only at the edges, and only in farms near forests. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists think this frog is in some danger of dying out because it does not live in many places, and human beings still cut down trees there. Scientists think there are five or six groups of this frog. Two of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Eravikulam National Park and Anamalai Tiger Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
