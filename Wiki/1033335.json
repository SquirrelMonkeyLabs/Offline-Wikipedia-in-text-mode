 "text": "Daptomycin is a natural antibiotic used to treat gram-positive bacterial infections. A unique mechanism of action has allowed low rates of bacterial cross-resistance to daptomycin, making it an effective treatment to severe infection such as Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Methicillin- reistant Staphlococcus aureus (MRSA). == Nomenclature and structure == Daptomycin is also commonly referred to as Cubicin or abbreviated to DAP. It is a lipopeptide, meaning that it is made of a combination of fatty acids and protein complexes. Daptomycin is biosynthetic, first extracted from Streptomyces roseosporus. == Medicine == Daptomycin is used to treat the following medical conditions: * right-handed myocarditis infection * complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) * meningitis * bacteraemia * sepsis * urinary tract infection == Mechanism of action == Daptomycin kills gram-positive bacteria by changing the structure of the cell membrane. Daptomycin enters the bacterial cell membrane by chemical exchange with calcium ions and phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG). == References == Category:Antibiotics",
