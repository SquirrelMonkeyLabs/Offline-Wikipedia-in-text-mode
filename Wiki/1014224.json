 "text": "The Kingdom of Hanover () was a kingdom in northwest Germany. It was created in October 1814 by the Congress of Vienna. It came after the Electorate of Hanover (officially the Electorate of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg). It joined 38 other countries in the German Confederation in June 1815. The kingdom was ruled by the House of Hanover. This was a branch of the House of Welf. It was in personal union with Great Britain since 1714. Usually a viceroy controlled Hanover. This was because its monarch lived in London. The viceroys were usually younger members of the British royal family. The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 when Queen Victoria became the queen of the UK. This was because females were not allowed to rule Hanover while a related male was still alive. Because of this, her uncle Ernest Augustus thus became the ruler of Hanover. His only son took over from him as George V. However, he was on the losing side of the Austro-Prussian War. His kingdom was then taken over by Prussia in 1866 and lost independence. It became a Prussian province. Hanover became part of the German Empire with the unification of Germany in January 1871. The country came back as the State of Hanover in 1946. But this state was later merged with some smaller states to form the current state of Lower Saxony in then West Germany. The city of Hanover became the capital of this new state. == Notes == Category:Former monarchies of Europe Category:Hanover Category:1814 establishments Category:1860s disestablishments Category:States and territories established in the 19th century Hanover",
