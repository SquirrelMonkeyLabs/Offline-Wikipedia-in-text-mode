It is an expression used to identify something that does very simple tasks in a very complex way. The expression was named after American inventor and cartoonist Rube Goldberg (1883â€“1970). Rube Goldberg machines are usually a set of simple mechanisms that are indirectly unrelated, which carry out a simple function, these are called chain reactions and initiate a series of events to produce a certain outcome.
