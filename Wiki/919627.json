 "text": "Alien Sector or is an run-and-gun shooter game developed and published by Namco in 1985. Alien Shooter runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware, but with a video system like that used previously on Metro-Cross and Dragon Buster (modified to vertical scrolling and a 1048 color palette) in 1995, the game was ported to Sharp X68000. Then released as compilation arcades in the Namco Museum series on PlayStation. It also appeared in Namco Museum Virtual Arcade on the Xbox 360, and most recently as one of the games available on Pac-Man Pixel Bash. Sequel to the game; Baraduke 2 released in 1988, exclusively in Japan. ==Other websites== * Category:1985 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Scrolling shooters Category:Virtual Console games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
