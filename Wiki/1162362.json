He studied at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. From 1990 he formed an artist duo together with Els Meesche, who later became his wife. They made hundreds of drawings, paintings and silkscreen prints; often about rock stars. They were the owner of Rock Gallery (formerly named Galerie Haags) in The Hague. Due to the rise of digital printing techniques, they decided to fully focus on art. They also came up with artistic projects. With pencil and pen he made football collection cards of the footballers of ADO Den Haag; and other artistic projects includes the yellow-green “Den Hagelslag” (a Dutch pun on hagelslag and The Hague); they initiated the exposition “Rembrandt2000”; Mesdag Revisited and Radar Love. In 2016 Van den Dop started “Rock History Tour”, a bus tour in The Hague along important pop history places. Van den Dop died from an illness on 14 January 2025, at the age of 70. ==References== Category:Dutch artists Category:Dutch painters Category:1954 births Category:2025 deaths Category:People from Leiden Category:Place of death missing",
