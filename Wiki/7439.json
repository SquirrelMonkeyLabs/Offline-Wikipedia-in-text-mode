The city is also the 11th largest by population in England and the 13th largest in the United Kingdom. ==History and Society== Leicester is about 2,000 years old and was called Ratae Corieltauvorum when it was founded by the Romans. After the Romans had gone and the Anglo-Saxons settled there, the town of Leicester was founded and named after the River Soar (then called Leire) and \"cester\" meaning the Roman ruins. Much later, after the invasion by the Danes, Leicester was within the area under Danish rule and one of the fortified \"Five Burghs\". In early modern times it became a centre of the manufacture of boots, shoes and knitted clothes such as socks. Since 1926 there has been a Church of England diocese of Leicester and in 1927 the Church of St Martin became Leicester Cathedral. As well as different forms of Christianity, many other religions have followers in the city including Islam and Hinduism. The UK census in 2001 showed that 17.4% of people in Leicester said that they had no religion. Leicester has a wide variety of people from other countries, including many from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Leicester also has communities of people from the Caribbean, Somalia, Afghanistan, Kurdistan, Iran, Poland and many other countries. Many of these communities have their own community organisations.
