 "text": "Hong Kong independence is the idea that Hong Kong should become its own country, separate from China. Hong Kong is a special region of China, which gives it some freedom to make its own rules, according to the Hong Kong Basic Law. After Hong Kong was handed over from the United Kingdom to China in 1997, many people in Hong Kong began to feel worried that China was taking away their freedoms and not allowing them to have true democracy. Supporting Hong Kong independence became illegal after the Hong Kong national security law was passed in 2020, making it harder for people to speak out in favor of independence. ==References== Category:Hong Kong Category:National liberation movements",
