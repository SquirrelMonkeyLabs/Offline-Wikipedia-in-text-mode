 "text": "Jai Singh Kanhaiya (1712–1793) was a prominent Sikh leader and founder of the Kanhaiya Misl, one of the 12 Sikh confederacies that emerged in the 18th century. He played a key role in various battles against the Afghan invaders and local rivals, expanding Sikh territory and influence. Known for his bravery, diplomacy, and administrative skills, Jai Singh Kanhaiya established his misl as a major force in Punjab, ==Early life== Jai Singh was born in a Jat family of the village Kahna, 21 km southwest of Lahore.[1] His father, Khushal Singh, was a farmer who also sold wood and hay in Lahore. His family had humble origins. He was initiated into the Khalsa by Nawab Kapur Singh and joined the jatha of Amar Singh Kingra.In 1759, his wife Desan Kaur (who was the widow of Jhanda Singh) gave birth to his only son and heir Gurbaksh Singh ==Military Campaign== In January 1754, Jai Singh carried out a daring robbery. Together with Charat Singh, they dressed as Muslims and entered Lahore secretly at night through the Shah Alami Gate. Their aim was to rob the rich merchants and jewelers living near the Begams' palaces, Parimahal and Rangmahal. They carefully and skillfully stole from the wealthy, leaving a lasting impact on the city. In 1758, Adina Beg, the governor of Punjab, set out to suppress the Sikh resistance. He sent a large force under Mir Aziz Bakhshi, supported by 4,000 carpenters with tools to clear the forests around Amritsar. A group of dedicated Sikhs, prepared to die for their beliefs, sought refuge in the mud fort of Ram Rauni near Amritsar. This group was led by Nand Singh Sanghania, along with key leaders like Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, his brothers, Jai Singh Kanhaiya, Amar Singh Kingra, and their followers. Mir Aziz Bakhshi surrounded the fort, but the Sikhs fought back with incredible bravery. Jai Singh Kanhaiya and Jassa Singh Ramgarhia led daring attacks, using firearms and arrows to inflict heavy damage on the enemy forces before retreating and securing the fort's gates. Jai Singh showed great courage by riding into the enemy ranks on a swift horse. Though surrounded, he fought his way back to safety inside the fort. One night, Mir Aziz managed to breach the fort's wall. The Sikhs responded with a counterattack, but many were killed, and some were captured. ===Jammu Affairs, 1774-84=== In 1774, a conflict broke out between Ranjit Dev and his eldest son, Brij Raj Dev, when Ranjit thought about making his younger son the heir due to Brij Raj's poor behavior. This led to a fight between them, and Brij Raj Dev asked Jai Singh Kanhaiya and Charat Singh for help. This started a long struggle. The conflict lasted for 22 days and ended with the death of Charat Singh. His wife and son, Mahan Singh, attended his funeral, which became an important moment in the fight. After Charat Singh died, Jai Singh Kanhaiya made Mahan Singh the leader of the Sukerchakia Misl, a decision that would affect future events. To weaken the Bhangi Misl, Jai Singh tricked them by paying a sweeper 4,000 rupees to kill their leader, Jhanda Singh. Jhanda Singh's brother, Ganda Singh, was deeply affected and retreated to Amritsar. This change in power helped Jai Singh gain more control. Ranjit Dev then gave Jai Singh a large bribe, which temporarily secured his position but added more instability to the region. Mahan Singh, though only 10 years old, showed smart leadership. He formed an alliance with Brij Raj Dev, marked by an exchange of turbans, to strengthen their bond. This alliance had long-lasting effects. Jai Singh Kanhaiya, wanting to grow his influence, took over the Sukerchakia Misl and arranged Mahan Singh’s marriage to the daughter of Raja Gajpat Singh of Jind. This marriage strengthened Mahan Singh’s power. Meanwhile, Ganda Singh Bhangi, seeking revenge, joined forces with Jai Singh's enemy, Jassa Singh Ramgarhia. This led to several battles, including the Battle of Dinanagar, where Ganda Singh was killed, changing the power balance in the region. ===Conflict with Jassa Singh Ramgarhia=== In September 1778, the Ramgarhia Misl and the Kanhaiya Misl clashed over the revenue of certain areas, as their territories overlapped in the Upper Bari Doab and Upper Jullundur Doab districts. In this conflict, Jai Singh Kanhaiya had the support of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. Maha Singh, Jai Singh and Haqiqat Singh Kanhaiya attacked Jassa Singh Ramgarhia's headquarters in Sri Hargobindpur. Despite strong resistance from Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, he was eventually forced to retreat from the Trans-Sutlej area. At the same time, Batala, under the control of Jassa Singh's brother Mali Singh, was besieged by Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya. Mali Singh was infamous for his cruel rule, which alienated the local population. Frustrated with his tyranny, the locals sided with the attackers and allowed the Kanhaiyas to enter the city. After Mali Singh retreated, the Kanhaiyas took over Batala, and Gurbaksh Singh was appointed the new administrator. Prominent figures like Raja Singh, Diwan Singh, Mansabdar Qanungo, and the Brahmin Tara Chand assisted Gurbaksh Singh in governance. Following these victories, the combined Kanhaiya and Ahluwalia forces advanced towards Kalanaur, which was controlled by Tara Singh Ramgarhia, another brother of Jassa Singh Ramgarhia. Tara Singh was defeated and killed, and Haqiqat Singh Kanhaiya took over Kalanaur. This led to the Kanhaiyas and Ahluwalias capturing the entire Ramgarhia territory in the Trans-Sutlej region. Afterwards, Bhag Singh Ahluwalia was assigned to Mahtabkot, near the Satluj River. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia instructed him not to block the Ramgarhia retreat across the river or interfere with their escape. ===Kangra. 1783=== Raja Sansar Chand Katoch, tried to capture the Kangra fort in 1782 but failed. He then asked Jai Singh Kanhaiya for help, and Jai Singh sent his son Gurbaksh Singh, along with Baghel Singh, to assist in the siege of the fort, which was under Saif Ali Khan. After several unsuccessful attempts, the fort finally fell into their hands when Saif Ali Khan died in 1784. Raja Sansar Chand continued the siege but couldn't capture the fort. Gurbaksh Singh, using smart tactics, bribed Jiwan Khan, Saif Ali Khan’s son, to let Sikh forces into the fort. This unexpected move allowed Gurbaksh Singh to take control of the fort, and Raja Sansar Chand had to withdraw. After this victory, Jai Singh Kanhaiya became the most powerful leader in the region. ===Conflict With Maha Singh=== Ranjit Dev died in April 1781, and Brij Raj Dev took over as his successor. Jai Singh and Haqiqat Singh led an expedition to Jammu, where they received a tribute of three lakhs, but Jai Singh kept the full amount for himself. In January 1784, Haqiqat Singh, angry over losing one lakh rupees paid by Brij Raj Dev, sought revenge and found a reason to attack Jammu by demanding a tribute of Rs. 30,000 from the Raja, despite only six months having passed. Brij Raj Dev, relying on the support of Mahan Singh Sukarchakia, refused, suggesting he would pay at the end of the year. Concerned that Mahan Singh might aid Brij Raj Dev, Haqiqat Singh proposed that Mahan Singh join him in looting Jammu and promised to share the spoils. Mahan Singh agreed, disregarding his brotherhood vows. They decided to attack in the middle of winter, during the severe Chalisa famine. Haqiqat Singh took one route, while Mahan Singh took another to encircle the city. However, Haqiqat Singh was delayed due to a conflict involving his ally, Amar Singh Bagga, and arrived three days later to find Mahan Singh had already surrounded the city. Brij Raj Dev fled, and the city's merchants offered a large sum of money to save the city, but Mahan Singh ignored their pleas, plundered the city, and set it on fire. When Haqiqat Singh arrived and saw the city in ruins, he was devastated, and he sent a request to Mahan Singh for his share of the loot, but Mahan Singh refused. Haqiqat Singh died soon after from the shock, ===Conflict with Sansar Chand=== Sansar Chand Katoch asked Mahan Singh for help in capturing Kangra Fort, offering a tribute of two lakh rupees in return. Mahan Singh agreed to send forces once he arrived in Gujranwala. Meanwhile, Sansar Chand laid siege to Jai Singh’s fort at Atalgharh, located on the Beas River. After four months of unsuccessful attempts, Sansar Chand lifted the siege. By this time, Mahan Singh had sent a large force of 1,000 troops, led by his commanders Daya Ram and Muhammad Salah. Together with Sansar Chand’s men, they began to besiege Kangra Fort, a siege that lasted six months. However, Mahan Singh's men soon ran out of money, and Sansar Chand refused to pay anything until the fort fell. The two allies began to argue, and in the fighting, Muhammad Salah was killed. Daya Ram returned to Gujranwala, leaving Sansar Chand to continue the siege on his own. Sansar Chand realized he had little chance of capturing the fort through direct combat, so he turned to diplomacy. He sent a message to Jai Singh, suggesting they join forces to fight Mahan Singh. Jai Singh agreed, and when he left the fort, Sansar Chand’s men rushed in. After a brief struggle, Sansar Chand took control of the fort. Later, after the marriage of Ranjit Singh and Mehtab Kaur, Mahan Singh forced Sansar Chand to give up all Kanhaiya territories at the foot of the hills to Jai Singh. ==Matrimonial alliance== Sada Kaur, the widow of Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya, was a smart and strategic woman. She believed it was in the best interest of the Kanhaiya Misl to make peace with the Sukerchakia Misl. To achieve this, she decided to arrange the marriage of her only child, Mehtab Kaur, to Ranjit Singh, the son of Maha Singh. She convinced Jai Singh to support this idea and then sent Amar Singh Kingra to Maha Singh to discuss the proposal. She discovered that Maha Singh's wife, Raj Kaur, had gone to Jawalamukhi on a pilgrimage to pray for Ranjit Singh's recovery from smallpox. Sada Kaur went there herself and persuaded Raj Kaur to agree to the marriage proposal. In 1786, Mehtab Kaur married Ranjit Singh, who was only six years old at the time. This marriage successfully united the Sukerchakia and Kanhaiya Misls, ==Death== Jai Singh passed away in 1793 at the age of 81. While some historians debate the exact year, Khushwant Singh and Massy confirm it was 1793. Jai Singh's son, Gurbaksh Singh, had already passed away before him. Gurbaksh's wife, Sada Kaur, took charge after his death. Jai Singh had two other sons, Nidhan Singh and Bhag Singh, from a different wife. Nidhan lived in Hajipur, and Bhag lived in Sohian. Jai Singh's third wife, from the Bhangi family, did not have any children. After Jai Singh’s death, Sada Kaur took leadership of the Kanhiya Misl, managing territories in Batala and Mukerian. The land was split: Sada Kaur received half, and Nidhan and Bhag shared the remainder. ==References== Category:1712 births Category:1793 deaths Category:Misl leaders",
