The two gospel both say that Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judaea and that his birth was caused by divine intervention. In Contra Celsum 1.51, Origen, who travelled throughout Palestine beginning in around 215, wrote of the \"manger of Jesus\".Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible 2000 p. 173 The Gospel according to Luke, about the Nativity, begins by narrating the Annunciation made by the Archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary of the conception and the birth of Jesus: In the Gospel of Matthew is detailed the Annunciation to Joseph: Mary the mother of Jesus was betrothed to Joseph, but was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Joseph intended to separate from her quietly, but an angel told him in a dream that he should take her as his wife and name the child Jesus, because \"he will save his people from their sins\". This would fulfil the prophecy that a virgin would give birth to a son, who would be known as Emmanuel, meaning \"God is with us\". Joseph awoke, took Mary for his wife (Matthew 1:18-24). The Gospel according to Luke, about the Nativity of Jesus, describes the news of a census desired by Caesar Augustus throughout the Roman Empire, according to which everyone had to return with their family to the city of their ancestors. Joseph, a descendant of King David who was born in Bethlehem, leaves Nazareth with the Virgin Mary expecting a child as the Archangel said.

In the Letter to Titus, Saint Paul wrote these words about the event of the Nativity of Jesus: Godâ€™s grace has been revealed, and it has made salvation possible for the whole human race (Titus 2:11). The date of birth for Jesus of Nazareth is not said in the gospels or in any secular text, but a majority of scholars believe that a date between 6 BC and 4 BC is most likely. Christmas Day celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ on December 25. ==References== Category:Jesus Category:Christology",
