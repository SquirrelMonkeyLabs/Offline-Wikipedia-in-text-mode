An example is some of the names of the days of the week, which come from Germanic deities. In English and Dutch, Saturn was not replaced. Saturday is named after the Sabbath in German and is called \"washing day\" in Scandinavia. Also, many place names in England such as Woodway House, Wansdyke, Thundersley and Frigedene are named after the old deities of the English people. More recently, people have created a modern form of Germanic paganism, called Asatru. Category:Paganism",
