 "text": "Soviet Philatelist or Sovetskii Filatelist was a Soviet central philatelic magazine published in 1922–1932. In 1925 and in 1928–1932, its name was changed to Soviet Collector or Sovetskii Kollektsioner.Archived from on 2015-05-15. == History == By 1922, shortly after the Civil War, a number of magazines and pamphlets for collectors appeared in Soviet Russia: * Russkii Kollektsioner (Russian Collector), published in Novocherkassk, * Priural'skii Kollektsioner (Ural Collector), * Krymskii Kollektsioner (Crimean Collector), etc. However, centralisation of collectors' organisations and periodicals was wanted: By 1924, these local magazines eventually closed down. In September 1922, the new magazine, Soviet Philatelist, first saw print in Moscow. Its founder and editor was F. G. Chuchin, Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily. In 1925, the magazine name was changed to Sovetskii Kollektsioner. The magazine was published biweekly. It was edited by V. A. Bessonov at that time. In 1926 three magazines, Sovetskii Filatelist, Sovetskii Kollektsioner and Radio de Filintern, were combined. They began to be published under one cover. Their individual lineal numeration was preserved. The last combined issue came out in December 1927. In the first half of 1928, the cover of the combined issues was only under one title, Sovetskii Filatelist. In July 1928, the magazine was renamed to Sovetskii Kollektsioner. It was published by the Soviet Philatelic Association and the All-Russian Society of Philatelists. The last issue appeared in December 1932.
