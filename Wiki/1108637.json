 "text": "DALL-E is the name of a family of text-to-image artificial intelligence (AI) models developed by OpenAI. DALL-E uses deep learning to generate pictures from descriptions that users type into their computer. For example, the image of the astronaut below was created using DALL-E 3, based on the description in the caption. == Release == The first version of DALL-E was announced in January 2021. It was replaced by DALL-E 2 on April 6, 2022. The following year, on August 20, 2023, DALL-E 3 was released. In October 2023, the functionality of DALL-E was added into ChatGPT. == Capabilities == The DALLE-2 AI system can create realistic images and art from a description written in natural language. It can generate completely new images that combine different, unrelated objects (like the astronaut and library in the image below) in ways that seem realistic. While it is not allowed to mimic specific artists, DALL-E 3 has the ability to create images in a certain artistic style. This is an advancement compared to DALL.E 2.
