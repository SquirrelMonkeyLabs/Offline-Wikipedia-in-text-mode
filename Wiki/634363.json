 "text": "Rice flour is made from either white rice or brown rice. To make the flour, the husk of rice or paddy is removed. The raw rice is then ground to flour. Rice flour is a particularly good substitute for wheat flour, which some people believe irritates their digestive system. Rice flour is also used as a thickening agent in recipes that are refrigerated or frozen. Many dishes are made from rice flour, including rice noodles and desserts like Japanese mochi and Filipino cascaron. Vietnamese banh canh uses rice flour and it is also used in making General Tso's chicken. In Chinese, it is called mifen (Chinese: 米粉; pinyin: mǐ fěn) Also it can be used in cooking, steamed, fried (fried rice noodlesChinese: 炒米粉; pinyin: chǎo mǐ fěn). Also it is used in other cuisine, such as galapong in Ilokano/Filipino, and pirinç unu in Turkish cuisine. It can also be used to make rice bread. Brown rice flour can be combined with vermiculite for the cultivation of mushrooms. Hard cakes of colonised substrate can then be fruited in a humid container. This method is often (though not always) employed by growers of edible mushrooms. It is a very simple and low-cost method of growing mushrooms. ==Related pages== * Kinako Category:Flour Category:Rice",
