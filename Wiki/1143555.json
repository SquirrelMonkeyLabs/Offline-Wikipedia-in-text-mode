In an 1927 interview in the Hannoverscher Courier in 1927 she said about that time that she liked it, but had the feeling that her strengths lay elsewhere and so she started with running and jumpion. In that period her father didn't support her sporting ambitions. Gladitsch trained secretly and that ended sometimes with slaps at home. However Bladitsch was dedicated and continued sporting. She was allowed to train with the Karlsruher FV from 1924 and with Karlsruher FC Phönix from 1925. She was trained by Georg Amberger. She improved over the years and was German runner-up in 1926 in the athletics triathlon. In the meantime she had also received support from her father and she said about it that \"he can hardly wait until I come back from the race and he hears my results\".
