 "text": "The Antarctic Peninsula is the largest peninsula in Antarctica. The peninsula is the northernmost part of the mainland of Antarctica. It is 1300 km long and reaches from Cape Adams (Weddell Sea) and a point on the mainland south of Eklund Islands. The northern tip is about 1000 km (600 miles) from Tierra del Fuego. There are many research stations as well as multiple claims of sovereignty on the Antarctic Peninsula. Average temperatures on the peninsula have risen by nearly 2Â°C in the past 50 years. This makes the Antarctic Peninsula one of the fastest warming places on Earth. ==References== Category:Geography of Antarctica Category:Peninsulas",
