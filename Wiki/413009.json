Michael Idomir Allen (University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1993), p. 264 The Angevins, Fulk II included, had become very good at making marriage alliances that helped their goals.Bernard S. Bachrach, Fulk Nerra the Neo-Roman Consul, 987-1040 (University of California Press, 1993), p. xi His father, Fulk the Red, had arranged his marriage to a Carolingian, Gerberga, the daughter of Ratburnus I Viscount of Vienne.Bernard S. Bachrach, Fulk Nerra the Neo-Roman Consul, 987-1040 (University of California Press, 1993), p. 7 Among other things this marriage made it possible for their daughter Adelaide-Blanche to marry a future king of France. It made them important enough for their son Guy to become Bishop of le Puy. After Gerberga died Fulk made another astute political marriage. He married Adelaide, the widow of Alan II, Duke of Brittany. Alan II had also been Count of Nantes and the marriage probably gave Fulk control of Nantes.Bernard S. Bachrach, 'The Idea of the Angevin Empire', Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies, Vol. 10, No. 4 (Winter,1978), p. 295 Adelaide was also the sister of Theobald I, Count of Blois. This allowed Fulk II to form an alliance with the House of Blois. Fulk died in 960.Bernard S.
