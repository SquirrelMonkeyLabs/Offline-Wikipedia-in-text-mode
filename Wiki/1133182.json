 "text": "The Cymric ( , ) is a Canadian cat breed. It is the long-haired breed of Manx cat. One of its special features is that it has a short tail. == History == Cymric and Manx are cat breeds that originated on the Isle of Man in the UK. Many people think that the cymric is the result of a cross between a manx and a persian that was done around the 1930s-1940s. In 1960, the cymric was first bred by two cat breeders named Blair Wright from Canada and Leslie Falteisek from the United States. They both decided to breed Cymric cats to refine the breed's standards and genetic traits, aiming for recognition by cat registration organizations. Initially, the breed was called the Longhaired Manx. ==Appearance== Cymrics have the same characteristics as manx cats, except for their fur. The Cymric has a long coat, while the manx is short. ==Characteristics== The Cymric cat loves to follow its owner around. It behaves similarly to a dog, growling when something bothers it. One unique trait of the Cymric is its fondness for shiny objects, such as jewelry. == References == == Other websites == category:Cat breeds Category:Cats",
