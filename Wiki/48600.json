 "text": "Warship was a popular British television drama series produced by the BBC between 1973 and 1977. The series was about life on board a Royal Navy warship, the fictional HMS Hero. It was mainly filmed aboard the Leander-class frigate HMS Phoebe. Four Leander class frigates played the role of HMS Hero. They were HMS Phoebe, HMS Dido, HMS Hermione and HMS Jupiter. All the crews of these warships were given HMS Hero cap tallies for filming purposes. The creator of the series was a serving Royal Navy officer, Ian Mackintosh. He wrote three books based on episodes of the series. They were simultaneously published in hardback and paperback. The books were: * Warship (published in 1973); * HMS Hero (published in 1976); * and Holt RN (published in 1977). The opening music of the series was a march played by the Royal Marines, called Warship, and written by Anthony Isaac. It is still played by Royal Marine bands. ==Related pages== * Ian Mackintosh * HMS Hero * HMS Phoebe (F42) * HMS Dido (F104) * HMS Hermione (F58) * HMS Jupiter (F60) * Leander class frigate * Royal Navy * Royal Marines * Fleet Air Arm * Frigate == Other websites == * Warship Episode Guide * British Film Institute site on Warship * Royal Navy leaflet on Warship, from the HMS Phoebe Association website * Comments on Warship by series Director Michael Briant * Webpage (at Home > Scriptwriting > Warship) about Michael J Bird's scripts for Warship * HMS Phoebe Association website * HMS Dido Association website * HMS Jupiter Association website * HMS Hermione Association website * Ian Mackintosh's Royal Navy service record on Opsromm.org * Category:Royal Navy Category:Naval transport Category:Ships Category:English-language television programs",
