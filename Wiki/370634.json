 "text": "Hogtie is a way of tying all limbs together, to prevent an animal from escaping. It was originally used with pigs and cattle. In BDSM, hogtie refers to the practice of tying up the submissive, so that they cannot move. This is dangerous, because the tied person or animal will have trouble breathing and blood circulation problems, so precautions need to be taken while doing this. category:Animal husbandry Category:BDSM",
