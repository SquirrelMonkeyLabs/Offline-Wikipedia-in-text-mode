Smoke from a fire in a ventilation shaft caused the suffocation of over 40 miners. A rescue gone wrong trapped miners and caused the deaths of at least five rescuers when the mine exploded. It is the deadliest mine accident in Russia since the 2010 Raspadskaya mine explosion in the same region. ==References== Category:2021 disasters in Asia Category:2020s explosions in Asia Category:2021 in Russia Category:Explosions in 2021 Category:2021 fires in Asia Category:Mining disasters Category:November 2021 events Category:Kemerovo Oblast",
