 "text": "The Marina City was designed in 1959 by architect Bertrand Goldberg and was finished in 1964 at a cost of $36 million to a large extent by the union of building janitors and elevator operators, who wanted to reverse the pattern of white flight from the city's downtown area. When it was finished, the two towers were both the tallest residential buildings and the tallest reinforced concrete structures in the world. The complex was built as a city within a city, featuring numerous on-site facilities including a theatre, gym, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, several stores, restaurants, and a marina. ==References== ==Other websites== * *A compendium for the most photographed building in Chicago, Marina City - Photos, Floorplans, History, etc. *Great Buildings - Marina City Category:Skyscrapers in Chicago Category:1964 establishments in the United States Category:1960s establishments in Illinois",
