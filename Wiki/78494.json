 "text": "New France was a colony in North America that was settled by France. The colony's regions included what later became Quebec, Acadia, and the Louisiana Territory. Its capital was Quebec City. The French settled there after finding Quebec and then creating New France. The colony was most valuable for its fur trade. New France surrounded British North America. Britain and France quarreled over which places were French and which ones British. France lost the colony during the French and Indian War, and it became part of British North America except the western part of the Louisiana Territory, which France had ceded in 1762 to Spain. In 1800, Spain returned that territory to the French, who sold it to the United States in 1803. == Other websites == * New France -Citizendium Category:Historical territories of Canada Category:1534 establishments Category:1760s disestablishments Category:1530s establishments in North America Category:Establishments in Canada Category:16th-century establishments in France Category:French colonial empire Category:Former colonies in North America",
