 "text": "United People's Bangladesh (), also called UP Bangladesh, is a political group in Bangladesh. It started on 9 May 2025. The group was made by young leaders and former student activists. Many of them joined the July Revolution in 2024. They say they want to give people a new choice in politics. ==History== UP Bangladesh was officially introduced at a press meeting at the Central Shaheed Minar in Dhaka. Some of the founders used to be part of Islami Chhatra Shibir. But now they say they have moved away from their past groups. They started the group after big protests in July 2024, which called for change in the political system. ==Ideas== The group supports democratic and liberal ideas. It also has centre-right views. It is not a political party yet. It works like a \"pressure group\", trying to bring political reform and protect democracy. ==Political activities== UP Bangladesh said it will not join the next national elections. Instead, it will focus on talking to people and building the group. It also plans to create a student group and other organisations. ==Leadership== The group has not named any official leaders yet. But many of its members took part in the 2024 protests and have experience in student politics. ==Future plans== UP Bangladesh wants to become a full political party in the future. For now, it is working as a pressure group. It wants to help improve democracy by working with the public. ==References== Category:Political parties in Bangladesh Category:2025 establishments in Bangladesh Category:Defunct political parties in Bangladesh Category:National Awami Party breakaway groups Category:Aftermath of the July Revolution (Bangladesh) Category:Anti-fascism in Bangladesh Category:Anti-discrimination Students Movement bn:ইউনাইটেড পিপলস বাংলাদেশ ur:متحدہ عوام بنگلہ دیش ta:ஐக்கிய மக்கள் கட்சி hi:आप बांग्लादेश en: United People's Bangladesh",
