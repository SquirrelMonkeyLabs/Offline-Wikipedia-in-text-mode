 "text": "Sophia Mendonça (Belo Horizonte, February 6, 1997) is a Brazilian journalist and writer. She is mostly known as a content producer and researcher on autism. In her work, Sophia complexifies aspects of the self-definition of autistic identity, by addressing topics such as sexual and gender intersectionality in autism. Mendonça has a master's degree in Communication, Territorialities and Vulnerabilities from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, after defending a dissertation on the intersectionality between autism and gender dysphoria, being the first autistic trans woman to achieve this title from the institution and receiving academic praise for her work merits. She reports having experienced violence after telling health professionals that she was an autistic and trans woman, having been forced to camouflage her gender identity by doctors and psychologist. Researcher Igor Ries, in his doctorate thesiss observed that Sophia's text is rich in sensitivity, affection and individuality. He considered the author's work generous, a sharing of oneself with the collective, as a way of representing in some way the transformation experienced or relief from her own suffering. According to the scholar, Sophia plays a leading role and, at the same time, announces this leading role in spaces that are usually little occupied by both autistic and trans people. Ries also praised that, when invite society to reflect on renewing the narratives about autism and placing itself as an active subject of this experience, Sophia demonstrates her work of caring for herself and the others. == References == Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian writers Category:People on the autism spectrum",
