It is named after Malaysia's second Prime Minister, Abdul Razak Hussein. In the 1970s, it was a small town known as Kampung Konggo (Congo Village). This area was home to retired Malaysian army personnel who served in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1960s under the United Nations. Some veterans still live in modern houses built during the area's redevelopment. On 1 February 1982, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad renamed Kampung Konggo to Bandar Tun Razak.
