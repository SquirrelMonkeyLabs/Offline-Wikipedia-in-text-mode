 "text": "In some hotels, guests can order food, and drinks, to be delivered to their room. This is called room service. Sometimes, room service is also offered on cruise ships. Depending on the hotel, the service may be offered at any time of the day, or the hours when the service is offered are limited. Lower-priced hotels, and motels usually do not offer room service. A simpler form of room service is to have a minibar in the room. To cover for the extra service cost, food and drinks are usually more expensive than in the hotel's own restaurant. Category:Hotels",
