 "text": "In architecture a corbel or console is a structural piece of stone, wood or metal sticking out from a wall to carry a superincumbent weight.Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0). Oxford University Press, 2009 It is a type of bracket. A corbel is a solid piece of material in the wall. A console, by comparison, is a piece applied to the structure. A piece of structural wood projecting in the same way was called a \"tassel\" or a \"bragger\" in the UK. The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic, or New Stone Age, times. The word \"corbel\" comes from Old French and derives from the Latin corbellus, a diminutive of corvus (a raven) which refers to the beak- like appearance.Oxford English Dictionary gives a similar etymology but from Latin corvellum or corvellus Similarly, the French refer to a bracket-corbel, usually a load-bearing internal feature, as a corbeau (a crow). == References == Category:Architectural elements",
