 "text": "The United Malays National Organisation' (Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Bersatu; short form UMNO or sometimes PEKEMBAR) is a large political group in Malaysia. It started in 1946 and is sometimes called Malaysia's \"Grand Old Group.\" UMNO mostly speaks for Malays, the biggest group of people in Malaysia. UMNO helped make the Barisan Nasional (BN) group, which, along with an older group, guided Malaysia from 1957 until 2018. During this time, every head of Malaysia's government was also the head of UMNO. After the 2018 vote, UMNO joined the government again because of a change in power in 2020 and later became the main group with Ismail Sabri Yaakob as head. UMNO's work is to keep Malay interests and ideas. It aims to guard the Malay way of life and to help and grow the worship of Islam in Malaysia.UMNO Online. UMNO's Constitution: Foundation and Goals. From: UMNO Online. UMNO's Constitution: Goal 3.5. From: UMNO has had troubles lately with some heads charged with wrongdoing. For example, Najib Razak, a past head, was part of a money problem called the 1MDB scandal. This caused many in Malaysia to fear dishonesty in their government. In 2018, UMNO chose Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as its new head after a vote against Khairy Jamaluddin and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Many people saw this vote as important for UMNO's future. Even with these troubles, UMNO is still an important part of Malaysian rule, speaking for the Malay people and taking part in big acts for the country. ==Related pages== *1987 United Malays National Organisation leadership election ==References== Category:Political parties in Malaysia",
