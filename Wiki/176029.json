It includes the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. == Geography == The South Region has an area of , the smallest region of the country. It is the only region of Brazil located outside the tropical zone, with clear variations about the seasons. In winter there are frosts and rarely snow. The relief is just a bit hilly, with a predominance of a large plateau, in general low. It borders to the north with the Mato Grosso do Sul and São Paulo states; to the east with the Atlantic Ocean; to the south with Uruguay states; and to west with Argentina and Paraguay. === Hydrography === The hydrography of Southern Brazil can be classified in three great regions of Watersheds: the Paraná River, the Uruguay River and the Southeast Brazil Rivers. The rivers of the southern region are availed for navigation, irrigation agriculture, urban water supply and power generation. The most important rivers are voluminous and have great hydroelectric potential. The Itaipu Dam, on the Parana River, is exploring the potential for power generation in the region. This operation allows the South and the Southeast an increasing use of electricity for domestic and industrial use. === Relief === The relief of the region is characterized by many plateaus that rises at altitudes up to more than 1,000 meters above sea level, decreasing to the west. Covering about 3/4 parts of the regional relief, this set is called Southern Plateau of Brazil and breaks down into plateaus that go from east to west. The highest point of the different states of the South Region are: Department Mountain Elevation Paraná Pico Paraná Santa Catarina Morro da Boa Vista Rio Grande do Sul Monte Negro === Climate === Only Brazilian region located almost entirely in a subtropical climate, the South is the coldest area of Brazil, with frost and even, in some places, the snowfall. The seasons are well defined and the rains are evenly distributed over the year. Southern Brazil has subtropical or temperate climate. The annual average temperatures vary between 12 °C (53.6 °F) and 22 °C (71.6 °F). Frost is very common and can snow in some mountain ranges. == States == This region is formed by three states: Paraná, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul.

Some places in the region must be emphasized, such as the Iguaçu Falls, (Natural Heritage and one of the New7Wonders of Nature) and the Ruins of St. Michael of the Missions (Cultural Heritage); the Itaipu Dam, elected the as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World); the winter cities on mountains of the SC and RS; and the Botanical Garden of Curitiba, Southern Brazil greatest icon. == History == The first inhabitants of southern Brazil are the indigenous people. Then came the Spanish Jesuit priests to evangelize the Indians and dominate the land. The pioneers of São Paulo attacked the missions to arrest the Indians. So, the Jesuits and the Indians abandoned the place and the cattle got loose in the fields. The São Paulo pioneers became interested in the trade of cattle. On the way through which the troops passed villages have emerged. For many years, the Portuguese and Spaniards fought over land in the region.

The capital of Paraná state, Curitiba, has the largest population and also the largest economy, and the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, has the largest metropolitan area. The 10 municipalities of the South Region with more inhabitants are: Main municipalities in the South Region of Brazil Rank Municipality State Population (2016) 1 Curitiba Paraná 1,893,997 2 Porto Alegre Rio Grande do Sul 1,481,019 3 Joinville Santa Catarina 569,645 4 Londrina Paraná 553,393 5 Caxias do Sul Rio Grande do Sul 479,236 6 Florianópolis Santa Catarina 477,798 7 Maringá Paraná 403,063 8 Blumenau Santa Catarina 343,715 9 Pelotas Rio Grande do Sul 343,651 10 Canoas Rio Grande do Sul 342,634 === Racial groups === The region received large numbers of European immigrants during the 19th century, who have had a large influence on its demography and culture.
