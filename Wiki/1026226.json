He was the crown prince of Yugoslavia for the first four-and-a-half months of his life, until the monarchy was abolished. Born and raised in the United Kingdom, he enjoys close relationships with his relatives in the British royal family. His godparents were King George VI and his daughter, the then-Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). Through his father, Alexander is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great- great-grandfather Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Victoria's second eldest son. Maternally, he is also a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandmother Victoria, German Empress, Victoria's eldest daughter. == Political views == Alexander is known for his humanitarian work. He is also known for supporting the idea that Serbia should become a monarchy again, with himself as the king. Numerous political parties also support this idea, as does the Serbian Orthodox Church. Public surveys in Serbia show that many people would also support the monarchy. Category:1945 births Category:Living people",
