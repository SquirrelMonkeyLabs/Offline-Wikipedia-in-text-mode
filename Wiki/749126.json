 "text": "Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (n√© Schreibvogel; born March 5, 1963), also called Joe Exotic, is an American jailed criminal and former zoo operator. He was born in Garden City, Kansas. Exotic owned and ran the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma. He is known as a tiger breeder. He ran for public office twice: first for President of the United States in 2016 as an independent and then for Governor of Oklahoma in 2018 as a Libertarian. In 2019, Exotic was convicted on 17 federal charges of animal abuse and two counts of murder for hire. He allegedly hired a man to kill Big Cat Rescue CEO Carole Baskin. He was given a 22-year sentence in federal prison. In July 2021, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that this sentence was long. In 2020, Netflix released a 7-part documentary, Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness. It talked about Exotic, his zoo, and his fight with Baskin. In prison, Exotic was put in quarantine in a security housing unit because he had been in contact with someone who had COVID-19. He was moved to \"a room with a hospital bed and a WINDOW\" after his fans wrote many letters to the prison. As of July 2021, Exotic is in prison in Texas. Exotic is openly gay. In May 2021, Exotic said that he had prostate cancer. In August 2021, he said that his cancer might have spread to his pelvis. In March 2023, Exotic announced his candidacy for President of the United States for the Libertarian nomination in the 2024 election. The following month, he withdrew from the Libertarian primary and instead chose to run for the Democratic Party nomination. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:2016 United States presidential candidates Category:2024 United States presidential candidates Category:Living people Category:American country singers Category:American LGBT people Category:American people convicted of attempted murder Category:American prisoners Category:Businesspeople from Kansas Category:Businesspeople from Oklahoma Category:Gay men Category:LGBT criminals Category:LGBT businesspeople Category:LGBT singers Category:Professional wrestling announcers Category:Singers from Kansas Category:Singers from Oklahoma",
