 "text": "The tan-edged tree frog (Sarcohyla cyclada) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it in cloud forests between 1600 and 2180 meters above sea level, in pine and oak forests at 2370 and 2670 meters above sea level, and in cloud forest and oak and madro√±o forests between 2121 and 2568 meters above sea level. This frog changes color. At night, the skin on its back is a very light brown and yellow-brown toward its rear end. During the day, its skin is brown with green marks and green-brown toward its rear end. It has webbing on all four feet, more on the back feet than on the front feet. People have seen this frog in bromeliad plants that grow on trees. The young have been seen in pools of water in streams. Herpetologist Duellman says this frog is related to frogs in the Hyla miotympanum group. There are fewer of this frog than there were. Scientists say this is because human beings change the places where the frog lives by cutting down forests to get wood to build with. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis can also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
