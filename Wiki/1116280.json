Hathi Sord was a vassal in the Eder state, but Amarsingh Parmar, the ruler of the Eder state, was killed in a battle after which Hathi Sord took over as the ruler of the Eder state. Maharaja Hathi Sord ruled peacefully till his death, and after his death his only son, Prince Samwaliya Sord, took the throne of Idar. == Fall of dynasty == Maharaja Sanvalia Sord appointed a Nagar Brahmin as the commander of the army of the state of Idar but Commander was jealous of the maharaja, Due to which the commander became with the Rathore Rajputs. The Senapati incited the Rathore Rajputs to attack the Maharaja but the Rajputs did not dare, after which the Senapati made a plan. According to the plan, the commander called Maharaja Sord for his daughter's wedding party and hid the Rajputs in the houses of neighbors. The Maharaja Sord was enjoying the feast with some of his ministers, when the Brahmin commander also gave him a banquet of liquor, due to which Maharaja Sord and his ministers and some special soldiers got drunk. The commander was waiting for this, the commander pointed to the Rathore Rajputs hiding in the neighboring houses and attacked the minister and soldiers including Maharaja Sord. It was the year 1300 and the Sord Dynasty of Idar came to an end this year. Rathore Rajputs captured the idar from Kolis but later rathores was drove out by Rao Rajputs. == References == Category:Koli clans Category:Koli princely states",
