 "text": "Survivor (, Hisardut), formerly known as Survivor 10, is an Israeli reality competition game show. It is based on the popular international Survivor television franchise. The series began in December 2007. It aired on Israel's Channel 10 for six seasons. After legal issues between Channel 10 and Castaway Television, the series went on a three-year hiatus. In 2015 the series returned for a seventh season on Channel 2 and Reshet. The show is hosted by actor and singer Guy Zu-Aretz. Following the basic premise of other international versions of the franchise, it features a group of contestants who are marooned in an isolated location, where they must provide food, water, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges for rewards and immunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants, until only one remains and is given the title of \"The Last Survivor\" and is awarded the grand prize of 1 million NIS.
