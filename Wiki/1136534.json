 "text": "Hyloxalus aeruginosus is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog can be as big as 25.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be as big as 29.2 mm long. This frog has disks on the toes of all four feet for climbing. The skin of the frog's back is green in color with some blue. There are blue-white marks on the sides of the body. There is gray color near the marks. The hard places on the toes are white in color with some gray color nearby. Parts of the belly are olive brown in color with white spots. The rest of the belly and the bottoms of the back legs are yellow in color. The iris of the eye is brown in color with a white circle. The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in exactly two places, both in the Cordillera Central. One was 1980 meters above sea level and the other was 2180 meters above sea level. Scientists saw this frog on the ground in cloud forests on mountains. They saw the frog near streams that had rocks in them. During the day, the frogs hid under rocks near the streams. They saw this frog in one protected park: Alto Mayo Protection Forest. ==Young== Scientists think that the female frog lays her eggs on land and that, after the eggs hatch, adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. They think this because that is what other frogs in Hyloxalus do. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis may have killed many of these frogs because it has killed other frogs nearby. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
