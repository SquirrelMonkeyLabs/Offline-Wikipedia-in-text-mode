 "text": "On August 8, 2004, a Dave Matthews Band tour bus dropped about of human waste from the bus's blackwater tank through the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago onto a passenger sightseeing boat sailing in the Chicago River below. As part of a 2005 legal settlement, the band agreed to pay $200,000 to environmental protection and other projects. The band also donated $100,000 to two groups that protect the river and the surrounding area. The band's bus driver, Stefan Wohl, pleaded guilty to dumping the waste in April 2005. ==Dumping== On August 8, 2004, at 1:18 p.m., Stefan Wohl, the band's tour bus driver, was alone in the bus and driving to a downtown hotel. He then emptied the bus' blackwater tank as it crossed the metal grates of the Kinzie Street bridge. According to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, passengers on the boat included persons with disabilities, elderly, a pregnant woman, a small child, and an infant. She described the incident: ==Aftermath== In March 2005, Wohl pleaded guilty to reckless conduct and discharging contaminants to cause water pollution. The Dave Matthews Band did not immediately apologize after supporting Wohl. He was sentenced to 150 hours of community service, fined $10,000 to be paid to Friends of the Chicago River, an environmental organization, and received 18 months probation. The Dave Matthews Band donated $50,000 to the Chicago Park District, $50,000 to Friends of the Chicago River, and paid the State of Illinois $200,000 in settlement. ==References== Category:2000s in Chicago",
