Maupertuis made an expedition to Lapland to determine the shape of the Earth. He is often credited with having invented the principle of least action; a version is known as Maupertuis's principle – an integral equation that determines the path followed by a physical system. His work in natural history is interesting in relation to modern science, since he touched on aspects of heredity and the struggle for life. == References == Category:1698 births Category:1759 deaths Category:French scientists Category:French physicists Category:French astronomers Category:French biologists Category:French philosophers Category:Writers from Brittany Category:Members of the Académie française Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:People from Ille-et-Vilaine",
