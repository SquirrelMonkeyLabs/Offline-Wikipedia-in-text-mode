It was directed by P. Ramlee, who also acted in it. The other two main actors were S. Shamsuddin and Aziz Sattar. P. Ramlee made three more Bujang Lapok films in the late 1950s and early 1960s. These films are famous for their funny look at Malay life. In 1986, Aziz Sattar made a new Bujang Lapok film with P. Ramlee's son, Nasir P. Ramlee. This new film is not a direct sequel because it doesn't continue the story from the earlier films. ==Related pages== * P.
