 "text": "Bah Ndaw (also spelled N'Daw, N'Dah, and N'Daou; born 23 August 1950) is a Malian former politician and soldier who was the 6th President of Mali and as well as the Chairman of the National Committee for the Salvation of the People from 2020 to 2021. Previously, he was the Minister of Defense and Veterans Affairs under President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta from 2014 to 2015. Ndaw led a coup d'état in August 2020 which deposed Keïta. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that happened during Ndaw's presidency, covid cases rose in Mali. Thus, Ndaw immediately called for vaccines from South Africa, Russia and the West. While the cases declined, the economy of Mali was still unstable. Because of the failure of Ndaw and his government of handling the economy, Ndaw's Vice President, Assimi Goïta, led another coup d'état on 25 May 2021 which deposed Ndaw. Eventually, Ndaw and his Prime Minister Moctar Ouane were arrested by the military and taken to Kati military base nearby the Malian capital Bamako. The next day, the UN Chief António Guterres called for their immediate release. On 27 August 2021, Ndaw and Ouane were eventually released from house arrest after an approval from Assimi Goïta. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Mali",
