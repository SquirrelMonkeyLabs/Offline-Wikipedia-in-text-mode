 "text": "A headstone, gravestone or tombstone is a marker, normally made from stone, that is used to identify a person who is buried beneath it (in the grave). These markers can be plain or beautifully carved with writing (epitaph or inscriptions) and pictures, but at times some gravestones can be unmarked, leaving a dead person unidentifiable. ==Other websites== Category:Burial monuments and structures",
