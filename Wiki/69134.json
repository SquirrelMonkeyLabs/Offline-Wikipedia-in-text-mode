 "text": "An n-th root of a number r is a number which, if n copies are multiplied together, makes r. It is also called a radical or a radical expression. It is a number k for which the following equation is true: :k^n=r (for the meaning of k^n, see Exponentiation.) We write the nth root of r as \\sqrt[n]{r}. If n is 2, then the radical expression is a square root. If it is 3, it is a cube root. Other values of n are referred to using ordinal numbers, such as fourth root and tenth root. For example, \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2 because 2^3 = 8. The 8 in that example is called the radicand, the 3 is called the index, and the check- shaped part is called the radical symbol or radical sign. Roots and powers can be changed as shown in \\sqrt[b]{x^a} = x^\\frac{a}{b} = (\\sqrt[b]{x})^a = (x^a)^\\frac{1}{b}. The product property of a radical expression is the statement that \\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}. The quotient property of a radical expression is the statement \\sqrt{\\tfrac{a}{b}} = \\tfrac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}. b != 0. == Simplifying == This is an example of how to simplify a radical. :\\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2} If two radicals are the same, they can be combined. This is when both of the indexes and radicands are the same. :2\\sqrt{2} + 1\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2} :2\\sqrt[3]{7} - 6\\sqrt[3]{7} = -4\\sqrt[3]{7} This is how to find the perfect square and rationalize the denominator. :\\frac{8x}{\\sqrt{x}^3} = \\frac{8\\cancel{x}}{\\cancel{x}\\sqrt{x}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{x}} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{x}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}^2} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{x}}{x} ==Related pages== * Geometric mean * Rationalization (mathematics) * Square number ==References== Category:Mathematics",
