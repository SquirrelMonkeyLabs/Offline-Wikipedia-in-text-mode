 "text": "Vaginal tumors are tumors that can be found in the vagina. A tumor in the vagina can be cancer (malignant) but not all tumors in the vagina are cancer. Tumors that are not cancer are called benign tumors. Tumors have many different names. Another name for a tumor is neoplasm. A neoplasm is too much growth of tissue that forms a lump. If cancer is found in the vagina it most often has spread there from other places in the body. Cancer found in the vagina may have come from the bladder, stomach and intestines. A tumor in the vagina can be solid or filled with fluid (or both). Vaginal cancer is rare. It is an overgrowth of tissue in the vagina. Some benign tumors may turn into cancer. A vaginal tumor can cause bleeding, pain with sex and feelings of pressure. A tumor in the vagina is often found during a check up and pelvic exam. Doctors may order more tests like an ultrasound, CAT scan and MRI. Doctors will look at a piece of the tumor under a microscope to see what kind of tumor that it is. == Benign vaginal tumors == *Blue nevusThis tumor may look like cancer. *Melanocytic tumor *Blue mole *Nevus bleu *Melancytic nevus *Leiomyoma *Fibromyoma *Adenoma *Squamous papilloma *Fibroepithelial polyp *Genital wart *Adenomatoid Tumor *Fibroepithelial polyp ==Malignant/cancerous vaginal tumors== *Yolk sac tumor *Endodermal sinus tumor *Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor *Ewing's sarcoma| *Vaginal melanoma *Melanocytic tumor| *Carcinosarcoma *Malignant Mullerian Mixed tumors *Metaplastic carcinoma *Sarcoma botryoides *Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma *Ambryonal rhabdomyosarcoma *Leimyosarcoma *Endometrioid stromal sarcoma *Endometrial stromal sarcoma *Undifferentiated vaginal sarcoma *Genital rhabdomyoma *Deep angiomyoxoma *Postoperative spindle cell nodule *Vaginal Solitary Fibrous Tumor *Undifferentiated carcinoma *Small cell carcinoma *Carcinoid *Adenoid basal carcinoma *Adenosquamous carcinoma *Mucinous adenocarcinoma *Vaginal micropapillomatosis *Endometrioid adenocarcinoma *Mesonephric adenocarcinoma *Clear cell adenocarcinoma *Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia * *Condylomata acuminata *Squamous cell carcinoma *Keratinizing, Nonkeratininzing, Basalaoid, Verrucous, Warty *Mesenchymal tumors *Alveolar soft part sarcoma *Mixed epithelial and mesenchymal Tumors *Malignant mixed Tumors resembling synovial sarcoma *Benign mixed tumors *Malignant lymphoma *Granulocytic sarcoma *Verrucous carcinoma *Squamotransitional cell carcinoma == Other animals == Vaginal tumors also can be found in some animals: * Sarcoma botryoides * Squamous cell carcinoma * Condyloma acuminatum * Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia * Fibroepithelial polyp * Clear-cell adenocarcinoma * Squamous papilloma * Leiomyoma * Blue nevus * Malignant melanoma * Primitive neuroectodermal tumor * Yolk sac tumor ==Related pages== * Urethral caruncle * Vaginal cysts * Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia == Notes == == References == ==Other websites== *Vagina, Anatomical Atlases, an Anatomical Digital Library (2018) Category:Anatomy of the female reproductive system",
