 "text": "The Malvasa rocket frog (Hyloxalus pinguis) is a frog. It lives in two valleys in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives in places that do not have too many trees, for example places where cows eat grass. Scientists saw these frogs between 2930 and 3205 meters above sea level. Scientists found the frog next to Parque Nacional Natural Purac√©, but no scientist has written about seeing the frog inside the park. ==Young== This frog's tadpoles swim in places that human beings made, for example canals if there are small woody plants nearby. Because people have seen this frog near water that has bad chemicals in it, scientists say it is good at living in places that human beings have changed. ==Danger== This frog is in big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms, for example potato farms, and get wood to build with. Scientists say this frog is in danger less from cutting down forest to make the farms and more from the bad chemicals in the area left over from the ones farmers put on the farm plants. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
