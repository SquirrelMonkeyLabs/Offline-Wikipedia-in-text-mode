 "text": "The Assam Indonesia tree frog, Eerie tree frog, Xizang warty tree frog, or black-spotted frog (Theloderma moloch) is a frog. It lives in northeastern India and southeastern China. Scientists think it may live in Myanmar. This frog lives in trees in tropical forests and places with short, woody plants. People have seen the frog on fallen trees and inside holes in trees with rainwater in them. Scientists think the frog lays eggs in ponds with these woody plants nearby. People have only seen this frog in forests that people have not changed. People have seen this frog between 300 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. Human beings build dams for electricity and cut down trees to get wood. These dams may change the streams and waters that the frogs need. The frog lives in some protected parks: Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve in China and Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary, Mouling National Park, Nameri National Park, and Namdapha National Park in India. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
