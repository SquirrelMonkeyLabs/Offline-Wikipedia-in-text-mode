Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee for President of the United States, will choose his running mate at some point before the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Biden promised to select a woman, which make it the third time in United States history that the vice presidential nominee of a major party has been a woman, after Geraldine Ferraro (1984) and Sarah Palin (2008). On August 11, 2020 Biden picked U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. ==Vetting process== Vetting is the process of beginning to search and or hire a person for an important job. In this case, vetting is the process of Biden's campaign looking for a running mate. The Biden campaign was reported to have begun the vetting process of potential running mates in May 2020. In July 2020, Biden said that \"I am not committed to naming any but the people I've named, and among them are four Black women\". At first, Biden hoped to announce his running mate the week of August 5, 2020, however his campaign has pushed the announcement date to before the DNC Convention would start, which would be August 16 or before. The New York Times reported on August 10, that an announcement of who Biden picked as his running mate will happen either August 11 or August 12. His running mate vetting process has been criticized for Biden's campaign alleged \"blatant disrespectful\" treatment towards black women and sexism. ===Final candidates=== On June 26, 2020, CNN and The Washington Post reported that the following five individuals were the leading candidates for the nomination. On July 29, just a week before Biden's planned announcement, The Hill reported that Karen Bass, Harris, Rice, and Warren had emerged as the \"top tier\" of candidates. On August 2, CNN reported that Tammy Duckworth and Gretchen Whitmer were also still under consideration.

Following the George Floyd protests, Amy Klobuchar was criticized for her lack of prosecution of police misconduct during her tenure, including a case involving the officer accused of murdering Floyd. On June 18, she announced that she had removed herself from consideration and urged for Biden to select a woman of color.
