 "text": "Sexy Lil' Thug Single by Beyoncé from the album Speak My Mind Released March 2003 Genre Hip Hop/R&B; Length 3:16 Label Columbia Beyoncé Knowles singles chronology '03 Bonnie & Clyde (2002r.) Sexy Little Thug Crazy in Love (2003r.) Speak My Mind track listing What's It Gonna Be (10) Sexy Little Thug (11) Fever (12) \"Sexy Lil' Thug\" is a cover and remix version of 50 Cent’s hit single \"In da Club\" (2003) by singer-songwriter Beyoncé. Recorded and released just weeks after the original, the track utilizes the original’s instrumental backing and overall melody, albeit without rap verses and with Beyoncé singing her own, female-perspective bars. In the original song, 50 Cent references some of the \"finer things\" in life following his career success, including Bacardi, champagne (\"bubbly\", \"bub\"), MDMA (\"X\", \"ecstasy\"), marijuana, and Mercedes- Benz; in a twist, Beyoncé chooses to highlight her impeccable style and taste, name-dropping Bailey's, Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Marc Jacobs, Versace and Zinati diamonds. The singer also declares \"I'm that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body\", and \"I'm that girl wearin' Chanel pearls; chandeliers on my ears from Bailey, Banks & Biddle\". Whether or not the remix was originally planned to be the lead single from Beyoncé’s debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), or if it was released simply for promotion, is unknown. However, Beyoncé’s father and then-manager, Mathew Knowles, stated to MTV News in April 2003 that the song was just a \"buzz-cut\" and would not appear on the upcoming album release. Despite some publishing and contractual issues surrounding its release, \"Sexy Lil' Thug\" received radio airplay and became a moderate hit, managing to remain on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven weeks, where it peaked at #67, as well as the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Airplay chart for four weeks, where it also peaked at #67. The song eventually received an official release in November 2005, on Beyoncé's Speak My Mind mixtape. ==Charts== Chart (2003) Peak position U.S. Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs 67 U.S. Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip- Hop Airplay 67 ==References== Category:2003 songs Category:Beyoncé songs",
