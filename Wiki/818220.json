Scientists think this frog is related to Sylvirana nigrovittata and Sylvirana malayana. The adult male frog is 41.6â€“45.4 mm long from nose to rear end and scientists say one female frog was 49.2 mm long. This frog is brown in color. It has a dark stripe down each side of its body. The stripe goes all the way from its nose to where its back legs meet its body. There are spots on the front legs and stripes on the back legs. The iris of the eye is gold brown on top and darker brown on the bottom. This frog has vomerine teeth in its jaw. It has disks on its toes for climbing. It has strong front and back legs. This frog does not have a pineal gland. It has a large humeral gland. The scientists who wrote the first paper about this frog named it after their teacher, Dr. Robert F. Inger. Dr. Inger worked as Curator Emeritus of Amphibians and Reptiles at the Field Museum of Natural History. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
