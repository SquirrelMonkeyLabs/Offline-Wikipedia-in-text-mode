 "text": "Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City is a former UNESCO World Heritage Site in Liverpool, England. The six sites included the Pier Head, Albert Dock, William Brown Street, and other famous landmarks in the city. They are considered the 'supreme example of a commercial port at a time of Britain's greatest global influence'. The sites were nominated to UNESCO in January 2003. By March 2004, ICOMOS recommended the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City as a World Heritage Site. It was accepted under cultural bases: ii, iii and iv. In 2012, the proposed construction of Liverpool Waters project caused the sites to be included in the List of World Heritage in Danger. In July 2017, UNESCO warned it might lose its status because of the development plans. English Heritage argued against the Liverpool Waters development. It thought some of Liverpool's most significant historic buildings would be “severely compromised”. In July 2021, UNESCO announced that the site had been stripped of its World Heritage status. == References == === Bibliography === * * == Other websites == * Liverpool World Heritage Website Category:Buildings and structures in Liverpool",
