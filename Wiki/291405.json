 "text": "The Second Battle of El Alamein was a great turning point in the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. The battle lasted from 23 October to 5 November 1942. The First Battle of El Alamein had stopped the Axis from attacking deep into Egypt further. Thereafter, Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery took command of the British Eighth Army in August 1942. In the second battle he took the offensive, with great success. The Allied victory turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended Axis's hopes of occupying Egypt, taking control of the Suez Canal, and reaching the Middle Eastern oil fields. The battle forced Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps to retreat back to the former French fortifications in the Mareth Line in the border between Tunisia and Libya. == Notes == === Footnote === === Citations === Battle Battle Category:Battles involving Australia Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles involving Germany Category:Battles involving Greece Category:Battles involving Italy Category:Battles involving New Zealand Category:Battles involving South Africa Category:Battles involving the United Kingdom Category:North African battles of World War II",
