 "text": "Rosli Dhobi (18 March 1932 â€“ 2 March 1950), also known as Rosli Dhoby, was a nationalist from Sibu, Sarawak, of mixed Malay-Melanau descent during the time Sarawak was a British colony. He was a leader of Rukun 13, a secret group that opposed British rule in Sarawak. The group, with members like Morshidi Sidek and Awang Rambli Bin Deli, targeted British officers. Rosli is best known for killing Duncan George Stewart, the second colonial governor, in 1949. In 1975, Mahathir Mohamad, then the Minister of Education, renamed SMK Bandar Sibu to SMK Rosli Dhoby in his honor. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Assassins Category:Malaysian people Category:People executed by hanging",
