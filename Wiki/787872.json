 "text": "Holy Roller is a term that was created in the 19th century. Some types of Protestant Christians who dance, shake, or roll on the floor during church services can be called Holy Rollers. People who do this say that the Holy Spirit makes them. Sometimes, the term 'Holy Roller' is used as an insult. However, Holy Rollers also use the term as a badge of honor,\"Why I Am a Holy- Roller\", a sermon by William Marrion Branham, August 1953 and it can also be used as a neutral term.\"The first tune, 'Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting', is church music. I heard this as a child when I went to meetings with my mother. The congregation gives their testimonial before the Lord, they confess their sins and sing and shout and do a little Holy Rolling. Some preachers cast out demons, they call their dialogue talking in tongues or talking unknown tongue (language that the Devil can't understand).\" Roots and Blues liner notes, Atlantic Records ==References== Category:Protestantism",
