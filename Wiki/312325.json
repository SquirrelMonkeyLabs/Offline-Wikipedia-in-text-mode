 "text": "\"Already Gone\" is a song by the recording artist Kelly Clarkson from her 2009 record All I Ever Wanted. This was the third single from that album to be released. The song is about the breakup of a relationship. Its release was surrounded by controversy: Clarkson said the arrangement used for the song was strongly similar to the 2008 song Halo from singer Beyonc√© and feared the public would say Clarkson had stolen it. Despite this, however, the song received strong praise from critics, and Already Gone became one of the highlights from All I Ever Wanted. On the Billboard Hot 100 the single peaked at #13.
