 "text": "A Nome (from , “district”) was an administrative part of ancient Egypt. Nome is a Greek name, used late in Egypt's history; the Egyptian name was \"sepat\". The division of ancient Egypt into nomes happened before 3100 BC. These nomes began as autonomous city-states, but later began to join together. According to ancient tradition, the ruler Menes finally joined all the nomes into a single kingdom.Herodotus, Euterpe, 2.4.1 and 2.99.1ff. The nomes remain in place for more than 3,000 years. Lower Egypt, from the Old Kingdom capital Memphis to the Mediterranean Sea, had 20 nomes. The first was based around Memphis, Saqqara, and Giza, in the area occupied by modern-day Cairo. The nomes were numbered in a more or less orderly fashion south to north through the Nile delta. The numbering started in the west, and continued with the higher numbers in the east. Alexandria was in the Third Nome; Bubastis was in the Eighteenth. Upper Egypt was divided into 22 nomes. The first of these was centered around Elephantine close to Egypt's border with Nubia at the First Cataract – the area of modern-day Aswan. From there the numbering progressed downriver in an orderly fashion along the narrow fertile strip of land that was the Nile valley. Waset (ancient Thebes or contemporary Luxor) was in the Fourth Nome, Amarna in the Fourteenth, and Meidum in the Twenty-First. == List of nomes == The nomes are listed in separate tables for Upper and Lower Egypt ===Lower Egypt=== Number Egyptian Name Capital Modern Capital Translation 1 Aneb-Hetch Ineb Hedj / Men-nefer / Menfe (Memphis) Mit Rahina White Walls 2 Khensu Khem (Letopolis) Ausim Cow's thigh 3 Ament Imu (Apis) Kom el-Hisn West 4 Sapi-Res Ptkheka Tanta Southern shield 5 Sap-Meh Zau (Sais) Sa el-Hagar Northern shield 6 Khaset Khasu (Xois) Sakha Mountain bull 7 A-ment (Hermopolis Parva, Metelis) Damanhur West harpoon 8 A-bt Tjeku / Per-Atum (Heroonpolis, Pithom) Tell al-Maskhuta East harpoon 9 Ati Djed (Busiris) Abu Sir Bara Andjeti 10 Ka-khem Hut-hery-ib (Athribis) Banha (Tell Atrib) Black bull 11 Ka- heseb Taremu (Leontopolis) Tell al-Urydam Heseb bull 12 Theb-ka Tjebnutjer (Sebennytos) Samanud Calf and Cow 13 Heq-At Iunu (Heliopolis) Materiya (suburb of Cairo) Prospering Sceptre 14 Khent-abt Tjaru (Sile, Tanis) Tell Abu Sefa Eastmost 15 Tehut Ba'h / Weprehwy (Hermopolis Parva) Baqliya Ibis 16 Kha Djedet (Mendes) Tell al-Rubˁ Fish 17 Semabehdet Semabehdet (Diospolis Inferior) Tell el-Balamun The throne 18 Am-Khent Per-Bastet (Bubastis) Tell Bastah (near Zagazig) Prince of the South 19 Am-Pehu Dja'net (Leontopolis Tanis) Nebesha or San el-Hagar Prince of the North 20 Sopdu Per-Sopdu Saft al- Henna Plumed Falcon ===Upper Egypt=== Number Egyptian Name Capital Modern Capital Translation 1 Ta-Khentit Abu / Yebu (Elephantine) Aswan The frontier or Land of the bow 2 Thes-Hor Djeba (Apollonopolis Magna) Edfu Throne of Horus 3 Ten Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) al-Kab Shrine 4 Waset Niwt-rst / Waset (Thebes) Luxor Sceptre 5 Herui Gebtu (Coptos) Qift The two falcons 6 Aa-ta Lunet / Tantere (Tentyra) Dendera The crocodile 7 Seshesh Seshesh (Diospolis Parva) Hu Sistrum 8 Abdju Abdju (Abydos) al-Birba Great land 9 Min Apu / Khen-min (Panopolis) Akhmim Min 10 Wadkhet Djew-qa (Aphroditopolis) Ifteh Cobra 11 Set Shashotep (Hypselis) Shutb The creature associated with Set 12 Tu-ph Hut- Sekhem-Senusret (Antaeopolis) Qaw al-Kebir Viper mountain 13 Atef-Khent Zawty (z3wj-tj, Lycopolis) Asyut Upper Sycamore and Viper 14 Atef-Pehu Qesy (Cusae) al-Qusiya Lower Sycamore and Viper 15 Un Khemenu (Hermopolis Magna) al- Ashmunayn Hare 16 Meh-Mahetch Hebenu Kom el Ahmar Oryx 17 Anpu Saka (Cynopolis) al-Kais Anubis 18 Sep Teudjoi / Hutnesut (Alabastronopolis) el- Hiba Set 19 Uab Per-Medjed (Oxyrhynchus) el-Bahnasa Two Sceptres 20 Atef-Khent Henen-nesut (Herakleopolis Magna) Ihnasiyyah al-Madinah Southern Sycamore 21 Atef-Pehu Shenakhen / Semenuhor (Crocodilopolis, Arsinoe) Madinat al-Fayyum Northern Sycamore 22 Maten Tepihu (Aphroditopolis) Atfih Knife ==References== Alan K.
