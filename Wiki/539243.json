Balet started skiing early in her childhood. At the age of ten she transitioned from skiing to snowboarding. Balet specialized particularly in switch, frontside 180, frontside 360 and jib. In 2015, Balet became the youngest ever Freeride World Tour champion when she won the women's snowboarding event. She won the same event in 2016. On 19 April 2016, Balet died in an avalanche while snowboarding in Orsières. She was filming a snowboard segment for a film called Exploring the Known on Le Portalet in southwestern Switzerland. Despite swift action from emergency services and attendance from Air Glaciers, she died from her injuries. ==References== Category:1994 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Deaths in avalanches Category:Swiss sportspeople Category:Snowboarders",
