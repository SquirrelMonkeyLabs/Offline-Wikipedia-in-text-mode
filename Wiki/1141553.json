 "text": "Santali interpretation of Mahishasura, named Hudur Durga is the deity of the Kherwal Santal people, who is called Mahishasura in Hinduism. Santals in contrast, mourns over the death of Demon Mahisa. ==Etymology== The word hudur means lightning. The word Durga means protector. The combined meaning of the word is lightning-hard guard. ==Legend== According to the Kherwal Santal and Asura tribe of Jharkhand, India, Hudur Durga was their millennial ancestor, the king of a village called Chaichampa. He was a very powerful and powerful king. The Aryans could not defeat him after coming to India. Then they began to think of ways to kill the king in various ways. They found out that the king was very feminine and that women were highly regarded in their society. So the Aryans sent a beautiful woman of fair complexion as a spy to assassinate the king, in some cases, the woman was involved in prostitution. The Aryans proposed marriage to the king, and the king, impressed by the woman's appearance, agreed to marry her. The king spent the nights with the woman for seven days after the marriage, and on the seventh day the woman killed the king. Upon hearing the news of the king's death, the Aryans invaded the kingdom to seize the kingdom, and the men of the kingdom, on the advice of their guru, bathed in the river Saraswati, disguised as women, and fled the kingdom to perform the dasai dance. The Santals claim that the Aryans exaggerated the woman as Goddess Durga and the king as Mahishasura in their scriptures as the woman of the incident, and further claim that the name of their king Hudur Durga was incorrectly mentioned as the name of the woman. During Durga Puja, they do not worship Durga but worship Mahishasura and mourn the women by dancing Dasai on the way. And according to many claims, due to the fact that the woman was a courtesan, Hindus use cow urine, Ganges water, cowdung along with the soil of brothels (four G: Gomutra, Gobar, Gangajal or Ganikalaya (brothel)'s soil) to make idols of Durga in Durga Puja. ==Related pages== * Mahishashur Jayanti * Fusulun Fi Adianil Hind * Al-Hindusiat wa Tasur Bad al-Firak al-Islamiyat Biha ==References== Category:Hindu gods and goddesses Category:Durga",
