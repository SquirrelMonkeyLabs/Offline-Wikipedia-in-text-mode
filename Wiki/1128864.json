 "text": "The Alabama Legislature is the legislative branch of the government of the U.S. state of Alabama. It is a bicameral body made of the House of Representatives and Senate. It is one of the few state legislatures in which members of both chambers serve four-year terms and in which all are elected in the same cycle. ==History== The legislature was first made in 1818, as part of the Alabama Territory, before Alabama was a state. In 1819, the Alabama constitution was accepted, and the legislature became a regular state legislature. During the American Civil War, people from the Confederacy went to Montgomery to make a new Government. They used the capitol grounds to do government work on the Federal level. This happened from February to May 1861. After that, the capitol was moved to Richmond, Virginia after Virginia joined the Confederacy. After the civil war, in 1867, a Constitutional convention was done to make a new constitution for Alabama. Two more were made, in 1875 and 1901. The 1901 constitution, changed the name from the Alabama General Assembly to the Alabama Legislature. https://encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/alabama-senate/ ==References==",
