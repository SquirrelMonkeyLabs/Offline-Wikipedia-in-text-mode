In the beginning of spring, they pray for a successful harvest and safety, while in early autumn, they express gratitude for a good harvest and pray for safety in the upcoming year. This ceremony is usually attended by farmers and is held at a nearby shrine managed by the community or at a location with a rope tied to a rock. == Jichinsai ceremony in Buddhism == In Buddhism, there is a practice called jichinho, chintaku ho, anchinho, jitenku, or jimatsuri, which is commonly known as a ground-breaking ceremony. In esoteric Buddhism, there is a ceremony called Chintaku Fudoho where Fudo Myo-o is the principal image. This ceremony is performed before building a hall, a Buddhist pagoda, or a tombstone, where a boundary is formed on the land. The ceremony is centered on the earth and heaven, and involves the heavenly gods and death gods. It is held to prevent hindrance from the dead souls and to requisition them forever. When constructing a hall, there is a method called chindanho, where the altar is built without laying a plank. The ground and chindan (altar) are then repaired separately. Sometimes both methods are used simultaneously. A kenbo containing five treasures and seven treasures is buried in the center of the altar, and a flat stone called chinseki is placed on it. The eight directions are then filled with rings, kui, and five balls. In the Nichiren Shoshu sect, the ground-breaking ceremony is held as a \"construction ceremony\" to purify the land with the power of the principal image and to pray for the safety of the construction. The ceremony involves setting up an altar at the center of the construction site and raising the principal image of the temple that will be built. == Steps of Jichinsai == The general flow of Shinto groundbreaking ceremonies is as follows. ; Chozuya (手水) : Before entering the venue of the Shinto ritual, wash your hands with water scooped from the wash basin to purify your mind and body. ; Harae (修祓) : After the opening ceremony, prior to the main ritual of the festival, a ceremony to purify the attendees and offerings. ; Koshin (降神) : A ceremony to welcome the gods of the land and the tutelary gods of the region to the shrine set up on the altar.

During the Naorai, participants share sacred sake and enjoy the leftovers from the offerings. In addition to the Shinto ritual, a casual gathering may be arranged where beer, boxed lunches, and other refreshments are provided. Alternatively, participants may rent a banquet hall at a restaurant to celebrate with a feast. == Izumo mansion == The Izumo Taisha holds a special Shinto ritual known as \"\" to honor the Okuninushi, the supreme deity of the land, and pray for the peace and stability of the land.

This is said to eliminate demon gates, attacks, azimuths, and obstacles, leading to prosperity. The traditional rituals of Izumo Taisha are followed, including special features such as three chanting of divine words, burial of sacred soil, and four clapping.
