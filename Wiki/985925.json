 "text": "A Menstrual cup is a menstrual hygiene device. It is inserted in the vagina during menstruation. Its purpose is to collect menstrual fluid. They are shaped like a bell or a ring. The stem is used for insertion and removal and the bell shaped cup is to collect the menstrual fluid. This process is different from sanitary towels and tampons, as they absorb the fluid instead.Elizabeth Gunther Stewart, Paula Spencer: The V Book: A Doctor's Guide to Complete Vulvovaginal Health, Bantam Books, 2002, Seiten 96 und 97, .Leslie Garrett, Peter Greenberg: The Virtuous Consumer: Your Essential Shopping Guide for a Better, Kinder and Healthier World, New World Library, 2007, Seiten 17 bis 19, . ==References== Category:Tools Category:Hygiene Category:Female reproductive system",
