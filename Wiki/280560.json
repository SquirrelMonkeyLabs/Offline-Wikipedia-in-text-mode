While on the Howard Stern show, ICP talked with Sharon Osbourne who bet $50, 000 they could not sell more than 200,000 copies, and that it would be subsequently dropped from its distributor. Violent J predicted that the group's next album would sell at least 500,000 units and they sold 400,000 units but Sharon never paid them. They left Island Records after Bizaar and Bizzar because their contract expired. Category:2000 albums Category:Insane Clown Posse albums",
