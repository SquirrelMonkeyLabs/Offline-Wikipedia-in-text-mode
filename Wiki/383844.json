The seat's first two members, Harold Holt and Sir John Gorton, were the 17th and 19th Prime Ministers of Australia. Higgins is the only Division to have been held by two Prime Ministers. Peter Costello the longest serving Treasurer of Australia and former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party also held the seat from 1990–2009. He resigned in 2009 which meant a by-election had to be held. There had also been a by-election in 1967, after Harold Holt disappeared in the sea. == Election results == ==References== *Division of Higgins – Australian Electoral Commission ==Other websites== * Kelly O'Dwyer's website Higgins Category:1949 establishments in Australia",
