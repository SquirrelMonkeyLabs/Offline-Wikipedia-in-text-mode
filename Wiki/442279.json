 "text": "A shirtdress is a style of dress which borrows details from a boy's-man's dress shirt. These can include a collar, a button front, or cuffed sleeves. Often, these dresses are made up in crisp fabrics like cotton or silk, much like a men's dress shirt would be. As they are typically cut without a seam at the waist, these dresses often have a looser fit, usually relying on a belt to define the waist. Button fronts and a forgiving fit make this a flattering look for most body types. ==Other websites== *Definition of a Shirt Dress by Cynthia Nellis Category:Dresses",
