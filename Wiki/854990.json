 "text": "The Canelos tree frog (Boana appendiculata) is a frog that lives in Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 14 and 1050 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 38.5 to 51.9 mm long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog is 53.5 to 72.6 mm long. It has skin the color of coffee on its back. It has a yellow or orange belly. This frog lives in forests with different kinds of plants growing in it and streams with fast- moving water. Because people have seen it in secondary forest and places where humans have cut down trees, scientists think this frog may be able to live even if humans bother it a litte. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
