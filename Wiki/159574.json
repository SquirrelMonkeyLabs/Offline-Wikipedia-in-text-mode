During the 19th century it was sometimes part of Romania and sometimes in the Russian Empire. It was again part of Romania most of the first half of the 20th century. The Soviet Union occupied the region after 1944. Today, most areas of Bessarabia belong to the Republic of Moldova. == Other websites == * Category:Divided regions Category:Geography of Moldova Category:Regions of Romania Category:Regions of Ukraine",
