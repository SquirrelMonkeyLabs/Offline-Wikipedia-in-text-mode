 "text": "The East India Company (EIC) was an English joint-stock company with headquarters in London. It was started for trading with the East Indies, but most trade was with India and China. It was given a royal charter, permission to exist, in 1600 and traded many things in India. In the mid-18th century, the company built up its own presidency armies and won the Battle of Plassey, which brought it from only trading with India to actually ruling the Indian subcontinent. The company had armed forces and armed ships. It fought against various Indian rulers and struggled against the Dutch East India Company and other European nations. It was ruled by one governor and 24 directors. It became a monopoly in most parts of India.Chaudhury S. 1999. Merchants, companies, and trade: Europe and Asia in the early modern era.
