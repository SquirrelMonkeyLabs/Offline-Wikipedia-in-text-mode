 "text": "Tuckman's stages of group development is a model of group development made by Bruce Tuckman in 1965. It has four phases: Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing. #Forming is when the members of a team just got together. #Storming is when they are in conflict and are not agreeing with each other. #Norming is when they have finished deciding what is \"normal\". #Performing is when they are working together efficiently. Tuckman believed that these stages are all necessary and always happen in order for a team: *to grow *to face challenges *to tackle problems *to find solutions *to plan work *to deliver results This model has become the basis for later models. More reading on this topic can be found here: Category:Psychology #Performing this is a stage of a fully functional group where members see themselves as a group and get involved in the task.",
