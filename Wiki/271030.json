 "text": "Notoceratops (meaning \"southern horned face\") was a ceratopsian dinosaur known only from a late Cretaceous jaw bone. Notoceratops walked on four sturdy legs, had a large head, a bulky body, a parrot-like beak, cheek teeth, and a small frill on its head. == Discovery == Notoceratops was named by Augusto Tapia in 1918 from a partial lower jaw found in Chubut, Argentina. This original Notoceratops bonarelli is missing and there is some doubt as to whether or not this fossil was actually a ceratopsian. category:Ceratopsids",
