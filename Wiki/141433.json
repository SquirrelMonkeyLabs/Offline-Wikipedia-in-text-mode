 "text": "Pink Floyd are an English progressive rock band. Pink Floyd has released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, eight compilations, three soundtracks, thirty-five singles, eleven music videos, four video albums and three box-sets. Formed in 1964, Pink Floyd was first known for their psychedelic or space rock music and in later years their progressive rock music. They are known for philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art, and big live shows. One of rock music's most successful acts, the group have sold over 210 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million albums in the United States alone. Pink Floyd had moderate mainstream success and were one of the most popular bands in the London underground music scene in the late 1960s led by Syd Barrett; however, Barrett's decline in health would eventually forced his band members to replace him with guitarist and singer David Gilmour. After Barrett left the group Pink Floyd released Ummagumma. The album was released as a double disc, the first disc contained songs performed live the other disc contained the new studio recorded songs. Singer and bass player Roger Waters gradually became the leader of the band in the mid-1970s, until 1985 when he left the group. The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979) with all of them topping the American record chart with the exception of Animals. The Dark Side of the Moon is the third best-selling studio album in the world (not counting compilations and various artists soundtracks). In 1985, Waters stated that Pink Floyd was no more, but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Waters sued the remaining members for the rights to the name, Waters lost and the band enjoyed worldwide success with A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994). == Studio albums == Year Album details Peak chart position Certifications (sales thresholds) UK AUS AUT Certifications (sales thresholds) BEL ESP FRA GER ITA NLD NOR NZ SWE SWI US 1967 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn *Released: 5 August 1967 *Label: Columbia/EMI, Tower, Capitol *Format: Mono LP, Stereo LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 6 — — 39 70 — 48 16 46 10 — 43 87 131 1968 A Saucerful of Secrets *Released: 29 June 1968 *Label: Columbia (EMI), Tower, Capitol *Format: Mono LP, Stereo LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 9 — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1969 Soundtrack from the Film More *Released: 27 July 1969 *Label: Columbia, Tower, EMI, Harvest, Capitol *Format: LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 9 — — — — — — — — — — — — 153 1969 Ummagumma (also live) *Released: 25 October 1969 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Capitol *Format: LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 5 — — — — 184 25 — — — — — — 74 US: Platinum 1970 Atom Heart Mother *Released: 10 October 1970 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Capitol *Format: Stereo LP, Quad LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 1 — — — — 122 8 — — 13 — — — 55 US: Gold 1971 Meddle *Released: 30 October 1971 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Capitol *Format: LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 3 — — — — 137 11 — — — — — — 70 US: 2× platinum 1972 Obscured by Clouds * Released: 3 June 1972 * Label: Harvest, EMI, Capitol * Format: LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 6 — — — — — — — — — — — — 46 UK: Silver US: Gold 1973 The Dark Side of the Moon *Released: 17 March 1973 *Label: Harvest, Capitol, EMI *Format: Stereo LP, Quad LP, cassette, 8-track, CD, Hybrid SACD 2 11 1 28 71 94 3 2 30 2 6 16 47 1 UK: 9× Platinum US: 15× Platinum CAN: 2× Diamond 1975 Wish You Were Here *Released: 15 September 1975 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Columbia/CBS, Capitol *Format: Stereo LP, Quad LP, cassette, 8-track, Mini-Disc, CD 1 — 2 — 67 112 6 13 — 2 — 14 29 1 UK: Gold US: 6× Platinum CAN: 3× Platinum 1977 Animals *Released: 23 January 1977 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Columbia/CBS, Capitol *Format: LP, cassette, 8-track, Mini-Disc, CD 2 — 2 — — 171 1 — — 2 — 3 — 3 UK: Gold US: 4× Platinum CAN: 2× Platinum 1979 The Wall *Released: 30 November 1979 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Columbia/CBS, Capitol *Format: LP, cassette, 8-track (all territories outside Europe), Mini-Disc, CD 3 — 1 — 9 92 1 13 — 1 24 1 29 1 UK: Platinum US: 23× Platinum CAN: 2× Diamond 1983 The Final Cut *Released: 21 March 1983 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Columbia/CBS, Capitol *Format: LP, cassette, Mini-Disc, CD 1 — 3 — — — 1 — — 1 — 1 — 6 UK: Gold US: 2× Platinum 1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason *Released: 8 September 1987 *Label: EMI, Columbia *Format: LP, cassette, Mini-Disc, CD 3 47 3 — — — 2 — — 2 — 3 2 3 UK: Gold US: 4× Platinum CAN: 3× Platinum 1994 The Division Bell *Released: 5 April 1994 *Label: EMI, Columbia *Format: LP, cassette, Mini-Disc, CD 1 1 1 39 1 — 1 1 — 1 1 1 1 1 UK: 2× Platinum US: 3× Platinum CAN: 4× Platinum \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that country. == Live albums == Year Album details Peak chart position Certifications UK AUT BEL FRA ITA NLD NOR NZ SWE SWI US 1969 Ummagumma (also Studio) *Released: 25 October 1969 *Label: Harvest, EMI, Capitol *Format: LP, cassette, 8-track, CD 5 — — 184 - — — — — — —74 US: Platinum 1988 Delicate Sound of Thunder *Released: 22 November 1988 *Label: EMI, Columbia *Format: Double LP, double cassette, double CD 11 15 — — — — 2 — 14 4 11 UK: Gold US: 3× Platinum 1995 Pulse *Released: 29 May 1995 (Europe), 6 June 1995 (US) *Label: EMI, Columbia *Format: LP, cassette, CD 1 1 1 — — 1 1 1 2 1 1 UK:2× Platinum US: 2× Platinum 2000 Is There Anybody Out There?
