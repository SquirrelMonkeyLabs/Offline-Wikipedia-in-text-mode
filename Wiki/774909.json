He was in the New Zealand Army as a corporal. In October 1995 Lakatani was charged with 22 counts of bribery and two of official corruption. Most of the charges were dismissed after the Niue Court of Appeal found that the law against corruption did not apply to Members of the Assembly. The remaining charges were later dropped. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Premiers of Niue",
