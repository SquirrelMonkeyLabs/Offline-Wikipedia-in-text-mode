 "text": "On 19 July 1333, a Scottish army led by Sir Archibald Douglas engaged an English army under the leadership of King Edward III of England (reigned 1327â€“1377) and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Halidon Hill. The previous year, Edward Balliol had secretly usurped the Scottish Crown from five-year-old David II (r. 1329-1371), with the help of Edward III. This was the beginning of the Second War of Scottish Independence. Balliol was quickly driven out of Scotland by a popular rebellion, which Edward III exploited as a pretext for invading Scotland in 1333. The immediate aim was Berwick-upon- Tweed, a strategically significant border town that the English besieged in March. ==References== Category:Battles involving England Category:Battles of the Middle Ages Category:14th century in England Category:1333 Category:14th century in Scotland",
