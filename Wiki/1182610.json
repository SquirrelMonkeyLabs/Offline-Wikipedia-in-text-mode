 "text": "The seal of the Senate of the Philippines is the official seal that is used by the Senate of the Philippines. The seal can be used by the office of the senate. However, the seal cannot be used by any members or the president of the Senate. ==Description== The Seal of the Philippine Senate was reused from the Coat of Arms of the Philippines. This seal was first used on July 15, 1950. Other things were added to the coat of arms to show that it is for the senate. For example there is a garland with 6 sampaguita buds on both sides of the coat of arms. The twelve buds mean the 12 regions of the Philippines. When the seal was first used, there were 12 regions of the Philippines. The sampaguita flowers show honor and dignity. There are Latin words under the coat of arms. They say Leges Servatae Pax Fiat (English: Law Serves Peace, Let It be Done). There are 24 stars around the coat of arms. They show the 24 senators of the Senate of the Philippines. ==References== Category:Senate of the Philippines Category:1950 establishments in Asia Category:20th-century establishments in the Philippines",
