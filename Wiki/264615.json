 "text": "A speech and language therapist is a healthcare professional who specialises in communication and swallowing difficulties. The main part of their work involves assessing people and planning therapy. They work with people of all ages across different settings such as nurseries, schools, day centres, care homes, clinics and hospitals. ==Communication difficulties== These can include difficulties with fluency, stuttering, making sounds and words, making sentences, understanding what others say, and using language socially.The Bercow Report: A Review of Services for Children and Young People (0-19) with Speech, Language and Communication Needs (2008) Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Health, London These difficulties fall into two main areas: ===Language=== There are two types of language difficulties: *Receptive People with receptive language difficulties have problems understanding spoken and written language. Because of this they usually also have expressive language difficulties although this is not always the case. * Expressive People with expressive language difficulties are able to understand but cannot say the words and sentences they want to. This may be because of word finding difficulties or problems making sentences. In children language difficulties are divided up into *delay: language follows the normal developmental pattern but at a slower rate e.g. a four year old may have the language skills of someone 12 months younger. *disorder: language is not following typical development. Where language difficulties occur with no other difficulties the child may be diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment. In adults acquired receptive and expressive language impairments are known as aphasia. There are many different types of aphasia depending on which areas of the brain are damaged and what symptoms they show. ==Swallowing difficulties== Speech therapists can help people with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). They help patients through changing their diets to different textures and consistencies, or they may recommend non-oral feeding.Communicating Quality 3 (2006) Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists == Assessment Methods == Speech and language therapists use a variety of assessment tools to diagnose communication and swallowing disorders. These assessments may include standardized tests, observational checklists, and interviews with patients and their families. The goal is to identify specific areas of difficulty to create a tailored therapy plan. == Therapeutic Interventions == Therapy approaches are individualized based on the patient's needs. Interventions may involve exercises to improve articulation, language comprehension activities, social communication skill development, and strategies to enhance fluency. For swallowing difficulties, therapists might recommend techniques to strengthen the muscles involved in swallowing or suggest dietary modifications. == Multidisciplinary Collaboration == Speech and language therapists often work as part of a multidisciplinary team that may include doctors, psychologists, occupational therapists, and educators. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive care addressing all aspects of a patient's well-being. == Technological Advancements == The integration of technology has significantly impacted speech and language therapy. Tools such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, speech-generating apps, and teletherapy platforms have expanded the reach and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. == Professional Resources == * Speech Therapy Totos: A resource offering therapy materials, tips, and support for speech and language development. * Learning Re-Imagined: An organization focusing on innovative educational strategies and therapy services that integrate technology and evidence-based practices. ==References== Category:Healthcare occupations Category:Speech disorders",
