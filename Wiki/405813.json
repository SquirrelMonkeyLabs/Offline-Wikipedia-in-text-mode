 "text": "Barbara Bennett (1940s–2000) was an American sideshow attraction. Her stage name was \"World's Smallest Mother\". Her bones were disfigured. In the 1970s, she attended a sideshow, and decided that she wanted to be an attraction. She joined the Hall & Christ show with her similarly afflicted daughter and her husband Ed. Audiences accused her of being a male attraction in drag, Peter Moore, who suffered the same sort of disfigurements. She worked the Hall & Christ show for eight years, then bought it. After four years, she retired. She went on to have three more children. She died on Christmas Day of 2000. ==References== * Hartzman, Marc. 2006. American Sideshow. Penguin. pp. 119–120.
