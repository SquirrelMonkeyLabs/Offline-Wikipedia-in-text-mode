The arrest happened after a teacher, and later the police mistook a clock he had taken apart for a bomb. His arrest caused a huge controversy. US President Barack Obama invited him to the White House. President Obama and others complimented Mohamed for his inventive nature. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Hillary Rodham Clinton also gave him support. His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, ran in the election for President of Sudan in 2010 and 2015. The elder Mohamed is the director of the Islamic Sufi Center in Texas. ==References== == Other websites == Category:2015 in the United States Category:2010s in Texas Category:Controversies in the United States Category:Islam in the United States Category:Islamophobia Category:September 2015 events",
