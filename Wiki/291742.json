 "text": "Jar Jar Binks is a fictional character from the Star Wars movie Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. He also appears in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. He is a Gungan and was born on the planet Naboo. Jar Jar is treated like the \"class clown\" by the other Gungans, and is often yelled at for being clumsy. This changes when two Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn are stranded on Naboo and Jar Jar accidentally stumbles into them in a swamp. He shows them his home, an underwater city built by Gungans to stay away from humans. There, he gets in trouble for letting humans into their secret city. The Jedi use the Force to convince the Gungan leader, Boss Nass, to let them leave safely. He is hated by many fans, and critics have accused him of being a racist stereotype of black people. ==Reception== Jar Jar is considered one of the worst characters in movie history since his debut.
