 "text": "E.T. the Extra Terrestrial is a 1982 adventure video game that was developed, published and distributed by Atari, Inc. It is based on the movie of the same name. The game was for the Atari 2600 and was planned for the Atari 5200 but was cancelled. E.T. is often considered to be one of the worst video games of all time, and was claimed to be the reason for Atari's massive financial losses during 1983 and 1984. The unsold cartridges of the game were buried in a landfill in New Mexico and was cited as one of the reasons for the video game industry crash of 1983. In 2014, many of the cartridges were excavated from the landfill. == Related pages == *Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, another game that has been considered the worst == Other websites == *E.T. the Extra Terrestrial at mobygames.com Category:1982 video games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Video games based on movies",
