 "text": "Basilisk lizards, also known as Jesus Christ lizards or simply basilisks or Jesus lizards, are a type of lizard. They are about 70-75 cm long, when fully grown, and weigh about 80 grams. They live in South America. There are four different species. They can be very still and hard to see. The basilisk can walk on water. It runs across the surface of a pond or pool, without sinking. Its speed keeps it from sinking. At the same time, its long tail helps it to balance. == References == Category:Iguania Category:Reptiles of South America Category:Reptiles of North America",
