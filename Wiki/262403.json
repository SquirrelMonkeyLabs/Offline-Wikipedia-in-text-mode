 "text": "A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft is at a right angle (90°) to the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use a transverse engine mounting design. The majority of rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine design, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the vehicle. == History == The first car known to use such an arrangement was a 1911 front-wheel drive car. It had a clutch at each end of the engine, driving the front wheels directly. The first successful transverse-engine cars were the two-cylinder DKW \"Front\" series of cars. These first appeared in 1931. After the World War II, SAAB used the configuration in their first model, the Saab 92, in 1947. == Placement of transverse engines == Engines may be placed in two main positions within the motor car: * Front engine mounted – for front-wheel drive vehicles * Rear or mid-engine mounted – for rear-wheel drive vehicles == References == Category:Automotive technologies",
