 "text": "The Hungarian Socialist Party (), commonly known by its acronym MSZP, is a centre-left social-democratic and pro-european political party in Hungary. == History == The 14th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) took place on October 7, 1989. At this meeting, 28 founders decided to form a new party. With 1,202 yes votes, 159 no votes, and 38 abstentions, they agreed to transform the MSZMP into the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), accepting continuity in the process. The MSZP submitted its registration request on November 16, 1989, and it was officially registered five days later, on November 21. The MSZP participated in its first multi-party parliamentary election in 1990, which was the first free election in Hungary. As a result of the 1990 free election, the MSZP was pushed into opposition. It governed in coalition with the SZDSZ during the 1994–1998 and 2002–2006 terms, as well as from 2006 to 2008. From May 1, 2008, until May 2010, it governed alone as the only party. Hungary has had four prime ministers from the MSZP so far. Gyula Horn served from 1994 to 1998, Péter Medgyessy from 2002 to 2004, Ferenc Gyurcsány from 2004 to 2009, and Gordon Bajnai from 2009 to 2010. Together, they led the country for a total of three parliamentary terms, spanning 12 years. == References == Category:1989 establishments in Europe Category:Political parties in Hungary Category:Hungarian Socialist Party",
