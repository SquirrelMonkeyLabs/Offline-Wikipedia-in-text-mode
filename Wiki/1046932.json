 "text": "\"Vibeology\" is a song recorded by American singer and dancer Paula Abdul. It was written by Sandra St. Victor, Peter Lord and V. Jeffrey Smith, with the production handled by the last two and was released as the fourth single from Abdul's second studio album, Spellbound (1991). It was originally going to be released as Spellbounds third single after Abdul had performed it live at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, but at the time \"Blowing Kisses in the Wind\" was being sent to radio airplay and was a popular choice for listeners. == Chart history == \"Vibeology\" reached at number 63 in Australia in December 1991 and at number 19 in the UK in January 1992. The single reached number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in February 1992, becoming Abdul's first single to reach outside the top 10 in the US since the original release of \"(It's Just) The Way That You Love Me\" in 1988. ==Track listings== * US 12-inch record # Vibeology - Keith Cohen's House Mix (Peter Lord; Sandra St. Victor; V.
