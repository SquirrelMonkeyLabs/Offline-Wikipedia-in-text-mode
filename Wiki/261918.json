 "text": "Chromium(II) chloride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CrCl2. It is a white crystalline chemical. It dissolves in water to produce a bright blue solution. It is a strong reducing agent. If the water has a little acid in it, hydrogen is produced. If the water has a little base in it, chromium(II) oxide is produced. The water needs to be very pure. It is made by reacting chromium(III) chloride and hydrogen at a high temperature. It can also be made by reduction of chromium(III) chloride with zinc. It is used in science research. == Related pages == *Chromium(III) oxide *Chromium(VI) oxide Category:Chloride salts Category:Chromium compounds",
