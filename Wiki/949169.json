 "text": "The western chorus frog, tree frog, chorus frog, swamp tree toad, swamp tree frog, swamp cricket frog, three-striped tree frog, or midland chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata) is a frog. It lives in North America. It lives in Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio in the United States, and a few live in Ontario in Canada. Other sources say they also live in Labrador, Quebec, Newfoundland, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, Michigan, and Tennessee. The adult frog is 10-37 mm long from nose to rear end. They are gray to brown in color on the back and lighter on the belly. Most of these frogs have three narrow, dark stripes down their bodies. Some of them have rows of spots instead. They have a white stripe on the upper lip. They do not have webbed skin on their feet. The female frog lays 500 to 1500 eggs, 20 to 60 per group of eggs. This frog is good at living in places where humans have built buildings. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
