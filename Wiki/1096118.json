 "text": "Body inflation is the act of expanding or pretending to expand a part of one's body, sometimes for sexual gratification. It could be done by inserting balloons or balls inside a tight clothing, like latex clothing, and then expand them. Some people have made suits to make them bigger overall. Sometimes the body is actually expanded by enema or drinking a lot of liquid. The concept of body inflation is mostly connected with the feeling of being bound to one place. Some people in this community are generally erotic and sexual role-play is quite common in person or online. The fact of having their fantasy stories ending in popping or an explosion sometime causes argument between the community. Its first fetish community organized online in 1994, in the form of an e-mail list; as the popularity of online communication grew, so did the online community. == References == Category:Internet culture Category:Paraphilias Category:Sexual fetishism Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024",
