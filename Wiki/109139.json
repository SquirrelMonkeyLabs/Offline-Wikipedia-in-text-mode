 "text": "Seventh Son (1987) is an alternate history and fantasy book written by Orson Scott Card. It is the first book in Card's The Tales of Alvin Maker series about Alvin Miller, the seventh son of a seventh son, who therefore has special powers. It was nominated for both the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the World Fantasy Award. The idea that the seventh son of a seventh son has special powers is common in folklore around the world. Seventh sons have strong \"knacks\" (special powers), and seventh sons of seventh sons are both very rare and vert owerful. In fact, the young Alvin appears to be the only one to be currently in the world, and the only other one who known to have ever existed turned water into wine. Alvin's powers make him the target of the Unmaker, which recognizes Alvin's powers as those of a Maker, who can build and change things, and so the Unmaker tries to kill him. ==References== ==Other websites== * About the novel Seventh Son from Card's website Category:1987 books Category:The Tales of Alvin Maker",
