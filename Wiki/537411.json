He was known as the Prince of Lamballe from birth. He died before his father, and did not have children. ==Biography== Louis Alexandre was born on 6 September 1747, at the Hôtel de Toulouse in Paris. The prince de Lamballe, as he was known all his life, was the couple's only surviving son. He was one of seven children. ===Marriage=== His father chose his bride, the Italian born Princess Maria Luisa Teresa of Savoy \"Mademoiselle de Carignan\". The wedding celebration lasted from 17 January 1767, until 27 January with feasts in Turin and Nangis. His father arranged the marriage to try and get his son to settle down as he was a well known womaniser. However after three months Louis Alexandre soon tired of his young wife and resumed his life of débaucherie. He eloped with Mademoiselle de La Chassaigne, an opera dancer, five months into his marriage. At one point, Louis Alexandre sold his wife's diamonds to raise money to pay his debts. ==Death== After a dissipated short life, Louis Alexandre died on 6 May 1768, sixteen months after his marriage, of a venereal disease at the Château de Louveciennes in the arms of his wife. He died without any children. His wife inherited part of his fortune. He was buried at the Royal Chapel, Dreux, France by his younger sister Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon. ==Titles, styles, honours and arms== ===Titles and styles=== *6 September 1747 - 6 May 1768 His Serene Highness the Prince of Lamballe ==Commons== Category:1747 births Category:1768 deaths Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded Category:House of Bourbon Category:Infectious disease deaths in France Category:People from Paris Category:Politicians from Paris",
