 "text": "William Pitt the Younger (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806) was a British politician of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1782–1783, 1783–1801 and 1804–1806. He was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1783 to 1801, and again from 1804 until his death. He is known as \"William Pitt the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father, William Pitt the Elder, who also served as prime minster. He became the youngest prime minister in 1783 at the age of 24. During his time as prime minister, the kingdom of Ireland joined with Great Britain and both kingdoms became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801. Pitt continued to be prime minister in the new Parliament of the United Kingdom. ==References== Notes == Other websites == * 1791 Caricature of William Pitt by James Gillray Category:1759 births Category:1806 deaths Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer Category:People buried in Westminster Abbey Category:Politicians from Kent Category:Prime Ministers of Great Britain",
