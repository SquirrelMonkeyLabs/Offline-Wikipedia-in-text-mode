 "text": "A stress-strain curve is a graph that is used to describe the relationship between stress and strain of a specific material. Stress is captured on the y-axis and strain on the x-axis. Stress is the amount of force needed to change the material's shape: in this case, to make it longer. Strain is a measurement of how much the shape changes. This graph is usually made by testing a material with a tensile test. A force, of varying amount, is used to pull the sample apart at a constant rate until it breaks. This graph is used to show important characteristics of a material such as the yield strength, ultimate strength, fracture point, strain hardening, necking and Young's modulus. * Yield strength - point after which permanent, un-fixable damage occurs (think of overstretching a rubber band and now it's larger than it was originally) * Ultimate strength - strongest recorded measurement of the material also known as maximum stress * Fracture point - point at which the material breaks * Strain hardening - area where the material becomes stronger, but is undergoing permanent, un-fixable damage * Necking - area where the material is past it's ultimate strength where the material is becoming smaller in area at the location where it breaks * Young's modulus - the slope of the stress-strain curve before the yield strength point, used to describe \"plastic\" deformation. That is damage to the material that can be completely reversed (think of stretching a rubber band and returning it back to place and it's back to it's original size) ==Related pages== * Strength of materials *Tension (mechanics) * Elastomers * Plane strain compression test * Stress–strain index * Tensometer * Universal testing machine Category:Elasticity (physics)",
