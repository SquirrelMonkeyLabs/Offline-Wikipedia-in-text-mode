 "text": "In formal number theory a Gödel numbering is a function which assigns to each symbol and formula of some formal language a unique natural number called a Gödel number (GN). The concept was first used by Kurt Gödel for the proof of his incompleteness theorem. A Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding where a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation, and a stream of natural numbers can then represent some form or function. A numbering of the set of computable functions can then be represented by a stream of Gödel numbers (also called effective numbers). Rogers' equivalence theorem states criteria for which those numberings of the set of computable functions are Gödel numberings. ==Definition== Given a countable set S, a Gödel numbering is an injective function :f:S \\to \\mathbb{N} with both f and f^{-1} (the inverse of f) being computable functions. ==Examples== ===Base notation and strings=== One of the simplest Gödel numbering schemes is used every day: The correspondence between integers and their representations as strings of symbols. For example, the sequence 2 3 is understood, by a particular set of rules, to correspond to the number twenty-three. Similarly, strings of symbols from some alphabet of N symbols can be encoded by identifying each symbol with a number from 0 to N and reading the string as the base N+1 representation of an integer. == References == * Gödel, Kurt, \"Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I\", Monatsheft für Math. und Physik 38, 1931, pages 173–198. ==Further reading== * Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, by Douglas Hofstadter.
