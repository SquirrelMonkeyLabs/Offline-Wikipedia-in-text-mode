 "text": "The Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church , commonly known as the Polish Orthodox Church, or Orthodox Church of Poland, is one of the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox churches in full communion. The church was established in 1924, to accommodate Orthodox Christians of Polish descent in the eastern part of the country, when Poland regained its independence after the First World War. Autocephaly was finally granted by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in November 1924. During the interwar period, however, the Polish authorities imposed severe restrictions on the church and its clergy. In the most famous example, the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Warsaw was destroyed in the mid-1920s. In Volhynia a total of 190 Eastern Orthodox churches were destroyed and a further 150 converted to Catholicism.Healy, R. and Dal Lago, E. The Shadow of Colonialism on Europe’s Modern Past.
