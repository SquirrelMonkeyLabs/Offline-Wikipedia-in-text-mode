 "text": "Sports drinks, also known as electrolyte drinks, are sold with the claim that they help athletes replace water, electrolytes, and energy before, during, and especially after, training or competition. There isn't good evidence that they help sports and fitness performance. Consuming too much or in unnecessary circumstances may damage health or performance. The drinks, or some of their ingredients such as sugar, may be bad for some people. Most sports drinks are isotonic, with 4 or 5 heaped teaspoons of sugar per eight ounce (13 and 19 grams per 250ml) serving. Some potentially harmful health effects of drinking sports drinks without prolonged exercise include weight gain, diabetes and damage to the teeth. These drinks are high in calories and sugar which contribute towards an unhealthy diet.{{Cite web |last=Schneider |first=Marcie Beth |title=Sports Drinks and Energy Drinks for Children and Adolescents: Are They Appropriate? |url=https://publications.aap.org//ExternalLoginResponse.ashx?
