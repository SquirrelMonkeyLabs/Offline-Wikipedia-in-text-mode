 "text": "\"Ironic\" is a song written by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard. It was produced by Glen Ballard for Morissette's third album, Jagged Little Pill. It was released as the album's fourth single in 1996. The song received a Grammy nomination in 1997 for Record of the Year. == Success == \"Ironic\" became Morissette's second number-one hit on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. It stayed there for three weeks. The song became Morissette's highest-charting hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number four. It is one of only two songs by Morissette to crack the top-ten on that chart, the other being \"You Learn\", backed with a live version of \"You Oughta Know\", which reached number six. Both songs were from Jagged Little Pill. In other countries, \"Ironic\" wasn't as successful. It was still a moderate Top 20 hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 11. It is considered to be one of Morissette's biggest hits. The song also received critical praise at the time of its release. Ironic is still popular today, mainly because there are still debates surrounding the lyrics of the song, and whether the examples mentioned in the song actually qualify as being ironic. ==Covers== The pop-punk band Four Year Strong covered the song in their 90's cover album \"Explains It All.\" ==Charts== Chart (1996)\"Ironic\", in Swiss, French, Dutch, Belgian (Flanders and Wallonia), Swedish, Norwegian, Australian and New Zealander Singles Chart Lescharts.com (Retrieved January 28, 2008) Peak position Australian Singles Chart 3 Belgian (Flanders) Singles Chart 6 Belgian (Wallonia) Singles Chart 9 Canadian Singles Chart 1 Canadian RPM Rock/Alternative Chart 1 Dutch Singles Chart 6 French Singles Chart 16 German Singles Chart 8 New Zealand Singles Chart 3 Norwegian Singles Chart 4 Swedish Singles Chart 24 Chart (1996) Peak position Swiss Singles Chart 9 UK Singles Chart 11 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 4 U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks 1 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks 18 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary 28 U.S. Billboard Top 40 Mainstream 1 U.S. Billboard Adult Top 40 5 U.S. Billboard Rhythmic Top 40 11 ===Chart procession and succession=== ==References== Category:1996 songs Category:Alanis Morissette songs Category:Rock songs",
