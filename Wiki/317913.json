It can perform ground attack, reconnaissance, and air defense missions with stealth capability.\"Knesset Finance Committee approves F-35 deal.\" Globes (Israel). Retrieved: 29 November 2010. The F-35 was developed from the Joint Strike Fighter Program. The X-35 made by Lockheed Martin and the F-32 made by Boeing were the two prototypes aircraft that were evaluated in this program. Although both designs exceeded the required metrics the X-35 was seen as superior and was selected to be developed into this new fighter. The development of the F-35 was very controversial. Many people felt like the US Air Force has been spending too much money on the F-35 project, and that the government should halt all development of the project. However in 2011 the F-35 entered production and was formally accepted into the United States air force. It was also introduced at later times to the United States Navy, Marine Corps and Air National Guard. An export model called the F35B was delivered to the royal air force in 2012. Over 148 F35A are operational. == Airframes == F-35A - Land Based, Stealth.
