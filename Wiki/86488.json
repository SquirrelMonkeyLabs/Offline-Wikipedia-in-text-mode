Thile also wanted the band to feature his friend and fiddle player Gabe Witcher, but didn’t know what kind of band he wanted it to be. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado, Thile met banjo player Noam Pikelny and later said that “every note he played was something I wish I’d played”. At that time, Thile decided that he wanted “put [his] stamp” on the normal bluegrass band.Royko, David. \"Chris Thile\". Bluegrass Unlimited. June 2007. Retrieved December 21, 2007 Thile wanted to find five people to make the five-piece band he planned. He had already found fiddle, banjo, and mandolin players, so he just had to find double bass and acoustic guitar players. The bass player Thile was looking for turned out to be Greg Garrison, a friend of Noam Pikelny. Before this, Pikelny had played with Garrison in the band Leftover Salmon. The guitar player Thile needed became Chris Eldridge, famous as a member of the Infamous Stringdusters. The five people met up in Nashville on one day in 2005 and decided to “do something musical together”. A few days later, the group met again “to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and [talk] about our failed relationships”. That night, they formed a bluegrass band. A few months later, the group decided to record an album. The album was recorded in two days at Sear Sound Recording Studios in New York City. The album was not made digitally, but in the old-fashioned way: on tape. In an interview with the United States magazine Guitar Player, Chris Thile talked about how How to Grow a Woman from the Ground was recorded: How to Grow a Woman from the Ground was produced by Thile, and the only musicians on the album was the band that Thile chose. The band was later named the \"How to Grow a Band\".Thile, Chris. How to Grow a Woman from the Ground Liner Notes. Sugar Hill. September 2006.

There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me.” Much of Thile's work on the album was inspired by his divorce, and Thile said that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he \"got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it.
