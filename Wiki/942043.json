 "text": "Pakdam Pakdai (), also known as Rat-A-Tat (for the English-language release), is an Indian Flash-animated comedy television series, formerly on Nickelodeon India and currently airing on Sonic Nickelodeon. The series is an adaptation of a 1998 french animated series, Oggy and the Cockroaches by Jean-Yves Raimbaud likely due to licensing issues and the show's immense popularity in India. The show began airing on 27 May 2013 to present. It now telecasts 585 episodes on Sonic Nickelodeon. Some aspects of the series are based on several Indian dubs of Oggy and the Cockroaches, which added dialogue parodying Bollywood actors and filmmakers including a narrator (unlike the French series' German dub) based on Nana Patekar, some of which even localized character names. Pakdam Pakdai is narrated by Nana, the eponymous narrator. Worldwide releases of the show, however, omit these in favor of silent comedy. == Episodes == #Beach Boys #Remote War #The Date #The Time #War of Years #Pigeon Baby #I Gotta Go! #Moo-ing Trouble #Doggy Don of Ghost #Safari Don #The Airplane #Cake Wars #Rest o War! #Dimshum to War ==Characters== The main cast are inspired by Oggys notable characters, for the first three seasons.
