 "text": "The Loterie de Bébés () was an alleged raffle in Paris, France, in 1911 where the prizes were orphaned human babies. This was done with approval from the authorities in Paris in order to find homes for the children and raise money for an orphanage and several charities. Quoted in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 11 February 1912, p. 61 and The Record-Argus, 11 January 1912, p. 1 From 1804 until 1923, only adults could be adopted in France, and only in very specific circumstances.\"From 1804 until 1923, only people over fifty years of age (men or women, single, married, widowed or divorced) without legitimate child, that is to say without a child born within marriage, were able to adopt. Only adults were adoptable, whether French or foreign. For the adoption to take place, the adopter must also have been at least fifteen years older than the adoptee, and given him/her during his minority at least six years of relief and continuity of care (or owed his life to an heroic act on the part of the adopted person).\" \"Simple\" Adoption in France: Revival of an Old Institution (1804-2007) by Jean-François Mignot, translated by Peter Hamilton. In Revue française de sociologie Volume 56, Issue 3, 2015, pages 525 to 560. Quoted in Snopes. In January 1912, Popular Mechanics noted that \"an investigation of the winners was made, of course, to determine their desirability as foster parents\". == References == Category:Babies Category:Family law",
