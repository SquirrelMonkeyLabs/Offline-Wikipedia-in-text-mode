 "text": "Mannophryne cordilleriana is a frog. It lives near the Santo Domingo River and Calderas Rier in the Andes Mountains in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in forests. Scientists saw the frog between 1300 and 1950 meters above sea level. Scientists found the frog in one protected place, the Protective Zone of the Santo Domingo River. The place where the frog lives also has part of another park in it: Sierra Nevada National Park. ==Young== The female frogs lay eggs on land. The male frogs watch the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles in pools near streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. People change the places where it lives to make farms and other things that people need. They also take water from streams for those farms. Waste from the Trans- Andean Highway can also hurt this frog. Scientists have found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on some of these frogs, but they do not know if the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill many of them. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
