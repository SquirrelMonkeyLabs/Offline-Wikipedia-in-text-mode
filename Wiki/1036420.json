 "text": "Abrosexuality also called Sexual fluidity, is a term that refers to a person whose sexual orientation changes over time. Abrosexual people can be attracted to various gender changes, from being Heterosexual to being Pansexual to being Asexual. The change can occur within hours, days, months, or years, and with each person, it is unique. ==Etymology and origin== This term originated from the Greek word \"abro,\" which means \"delicate\" or \"graceful.\" For the first time, it was used in online forums such as DeviantArt and Tumblr in 2013. The term gained more popularity through social media, and an abrosexual pride flag—consisting of green, white, and pink colors—was created on Tumblr in 2015. == References == Category:LGBT identities",
