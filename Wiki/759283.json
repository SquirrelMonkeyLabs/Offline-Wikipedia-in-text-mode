Neither of the two had traveled to areas with known coronavirus(-19) cases. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection. Two other samples in Pleven and Gabrovo were positive on 8 March. ==Response== After the number of patients in the country had reached 23, the Bulgarian Parliament voted unanimously to declare a state of emergency from 13 March until 13 April. A 14-day preventive house quarantine was made for citizens who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient or have returned from an overseas region with a high number of cases. For patients tested positive for the virus a 21-day house quarantine was created. The National Crisis-management Staff later increased the recovery house quarantine by a week to 28 days. With the continuing increase of COVID-19 cases on a daily basis, on 1 April the Bulgarian government requested that Parliament extends the state of emergency by one month until 13 May. ==Numbers== As of 14 May 2020, there are 2,100 officially confirmed cases spread throughout all Bulgarian provinces, with 99 recorded deaths and 521 recoveries. A total of 61,711 PCR tests (or 8,868 per million citizens) had been performed by 13 May, with 3.40% being positive. == Related pages == * MERS and MERS-CoV * Aspiration (pneumonia) * COVID-19 in China. * Pancreas ==References== Category:21st century in Bulgaria Bulgaria",
