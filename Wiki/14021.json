 "text": "Something Awful is a comedy website and forums. The part of the website where people are paid to write comedy is called the \"front page,\" and the part where people talk about a variety of things is the forums. People have to pay money to join the forums to talk with other people around the world. It currently costs $9.95 to join. The money they pay goes towards keeping the website online, and is said to make the forums higher quality, because members of the forums have something to lose if they are banned. Because of the comedy nature of the website, people on the forums often post to try to make people laugh instead of posting seriously. Something Awful was started by Richard \"Lowtax\" Kyanka in 1999. In March, 2008 Richard \"Lowtax\" Kyanka left forums management to Kevin \"Fragmaster\" Bowen, in order to focus on operating the main site. ==Related pages== * Kiwi Farms * Know Your Meme * Reddit ==Other websites== * Something Awful * Something Awful Twitter account Category:American websites",
