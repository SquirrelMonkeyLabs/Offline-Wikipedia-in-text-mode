The girls performed \"Into the New World\"(), which became their single. \"M.Net's Girls Go To School\" was filmed during this time, to show how the girls made their debut. The show ended after 9 episodes, when they finally appeared on another show, \"School of Rock\". In August 2007, the single \"Into the New World\" was released. This single included two other songs, \"Beginning\" and \"Perfect for You\" (), later renamed as Honey for their debut album Girls' Generation.
