 "text": "The British Democratic Party, commonly known as the British Democrats, is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom. It was registered with the electoral commission in 2011 and officially started in 2013. It was formed by former members of multiple parties including the British National Party, Democratic Nationalists, Freedom Party and the UK Independence Party. It is the largest far-right party in the UK, holding three parish councillors. == History == Andrew Brons left the BNP in October 2012 after failing to unseat Nick Griffin as party leader in 2011. Multiple other BNP members joined him, including Kevin Scott, founder and director of Civil Liberty and party organiser for the BNP. Andrew Brons has been the National Nominating Officer of the British Democratic Party since its creation in February 2013, with James Lewthwaite as Leader and Chairman, and Christopher Canham as the Treasurer and Membership Secretary. Following the dissolution of the For Britain Movement and the inactivity of the British National Party, a multitude of nationalist councillors and far-right activists have started joining the BDP. In September 2022, BDP's chairman shared a platform in Preston, Lancashire, with Stephen Frost, leader of the British Movement. == References == Category:Political parties in the United Kingdom",
