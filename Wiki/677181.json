 "text": "St. Uriel's Episcopal Church, also known as Church of St. Uriel the Archangel, or simply St. Uriel's, is an Episcopal church located in Sea Girt, Monmouth, New Jersey. The church adheres to the catholic and orthodox traditions of Anglicanism, that is, a follower of Anglo-Catholicism, which is similar to the High Church. It is one of three churches in the United States dedicated to Saint Uriel the Archangel, the other two being Archangel St. Uriel Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church in Elmwood Place, Ohio, and Uriel Presbyterian Church in Chester, South Carolina. The parish banner was made by the Sisters of Bethany and dedicated at the church in 1958. Until that year, the church was the only Anglican temple dedicated to the Archangel Uriel. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Anglican churches Category:Churches in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in New Jersey",
