The first is the dialect used by descendants of Visayan migrants, which is very similar to the provinces from which they originated. Over time, they become more like Cebu City or southeastern Cebuano. The second type of Cebuano in Davao is spoken by migrants, rich or poor, from non-Visayan provinces and products of intermarriages and their descendants. Their dialect is a mix of languages, mostly Cebuano, Tagalog, and Hiligaynon. ==Words and dialects== Urban Cebuano (Cebu City) Davaoe単o Cebuano (Davao City) Asa ka paadto ana. Asa mo muadto ana.
