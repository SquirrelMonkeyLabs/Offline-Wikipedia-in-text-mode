Franz Vonlichten and Helmut Vonlichten created the music from Pythagorean ideas that combine very different elements and still produce harmony. Franz died tragically in 2010. Helmut released the last song \"Christmas Eve\" in November 2010. The group ceased its activity. In November 2011, Helmut Vonlichten has formed a new band called Les Friction.
