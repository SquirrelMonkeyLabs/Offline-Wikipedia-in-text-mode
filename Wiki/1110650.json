 "text": "The vitreous body or often called vitreous humor is a chamber of gel-like fluid between the retina and lens. It is not to be confused to be with aqueous humor, the other fluid in your eye that can be found between the cornea and lens. ==Structure== The vitreous humor is a transparent, colorless, gelatinous mass that fills the chamber in the eye between the lens and retina. It makes up four-fifths of the volume of the eyeball. The vitreous humour is attached to the vitreous membrane above the retina. Collagen fibrils attach the vitreous to specific areas like the optic nerve disc, and the lens capsule. It also attaches to retinal vessels and the macula, which is essential for sharp vision.
