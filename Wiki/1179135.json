 "text": "The Radical Reformation was a movement that began in the 16th century as a response to what many saw as corruption in both the Catholic Church and the growing Protestant Reformation led by Martin Luther and others. It started in Germany and Switzerland, and many radical Protestant groups formed across Europe. These groups included people like Thomas M端ntzer, Andreas Karlstadt, the Zwickau prophets, and Anabaptists like the Hutterites and Mennonites. The Radical Reformation was met with strong opposition and persecution, but despite this, many people still supported it, especially in countries like Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. The Radical Reformation had a focus on millenarianism, which meant many people thought the world was about to end. A notable example was John of Leiden, who led the city of M端nster in 1535. His group was eventually defeated by Catholic and Lutheran forces. After this, some groups, like the Batenburgers, continued to hold militant Anabaptist beliefs, while others, like the Hutterites and Mennonites, became non-violent. These early Anabaptists believed that the church should not be supported by the state and that Christianity should be a personal decision, not forced on anyone. They also rejected infant baptism and only practiced adult baptism, also called believer's baptism. As the movement continued, smaller groups like the Mennonites, Amish, and Hutterites formed. A key figure in the later Anabaptist movement was Menno Simons, a former Catholic priest from the Netherlands. He joined the Anabaptists in 1536 and became known for his belief in pacifism and non-violence, which became a central part of the Mennonite faith. These groups were often focused on forming separatist communities where they could practice their faith without outside interference. Though most Radical Reformers were Anabaptists, some, like Thomas M端ntzer, Andreas Karlstadt, and Kaspar Schwenkfeld, did not fully agree with the mainstream Anabaptist movement. These leaders had different views on violence, baptism, and other religious practices. For example, M端ntzer was involved in the German Peasants' War, and Karlstadt disagreed with Luther on several theological issues. Additionally, in 17th-century England, movements like the Quakers, led by George Fox, emerged with ideas similar to those of the Radical Reformation. In addition to Anabaptists, other groups like the Socinians and Polish Brethren rejected the traditional belief in the Trinity and were considered part of the Radical Reformation. These groups often faced persecution for their beliefs, but they played an important role in the development of religious thought during that time. The beliefs of the Radical Reformation were based on the idea of a Believers' Church, meaning the church should only include people who truly accepted Jesus Christ and demonstrated this through adult baptism. Unlike other Protestant groups that wanted to replace the Catholic Church with their own church structure, the Radical Reformers rejected the authority of institutional churches altogether. They believed the true church would always be persecuted and that the conversion of Constantine I marked the beginning of a Great Apostasy, a time when the church began to stray from its original teachings. ==Other websites== * Radical Reformation at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online * 16th Century Reformation Reading Room , Tyndale Seminary * Radical Reformation at Protestant Museum Category:Anabaptism Category:Protestant Reformation Category:Christian terminology Category:16th century in Europe",
