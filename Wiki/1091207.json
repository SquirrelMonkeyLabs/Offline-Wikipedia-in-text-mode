 "text": "Milano Centrale is the main railway station of the city of Milan, Italy, and is the second busiest railway station in Italy (after Roma Termini). Data from grandistazioni.it (July 2007) It is at the northern end of central Milan. It is the largest railway station in Europe. The station is a terminus. It opened in 1931. The old central station built in 1864 could not handle the increased traffic caused by the opening of the Simplon Tunnel in 1906. Milano Centrale has high-speed connections to Turin in the west, Venice via Verona in the east and on the north–south mainline to Bologna, Rome, Naples and Salerno. The Simplon and Gotthard railway lines connect Milano Centrale to Basel and Geneva via Domodossola and Zürich via Chiasso in Switzerland. The Milan suburban railway service does not use Milano Centrale but the other mainline stations: Porta Garibaldi (northwest), Cadorna (west) and Rogoredo (east). Architect Aldo Rossi said in an interview of February 1995 to Cecilia Bolognesi:Aldo Rossi, Luoghi Urbani, Unicopli 1999, p. 31 \"They told me that when Frank Lloyd Wright came to Milan, and he came only once, he was really impressed by it and said it was the most beautiful station in the world. For me it is also more beautiful than Grand Central Station in New York. I know few stations like this one\". ==Gallery== File:Milano Stazione Centrale 1865.jpg|The first Milano Centrale railway station from Giornale dell'Ingegnere e Architetto, January 1865, vol. 13, Annex File:Milano-Centrale-Entrance-Hall-2012.JPG|A view of the arrival hall File:Milan Centrale Stazione trainshed.jpg|The roof of the central section File:Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Milano, 1969) - BEIC 6330877.jpg|Lateral view of the gallery ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Milan Category:Railway stations in Italy Category:1931 establishments in Italy",
