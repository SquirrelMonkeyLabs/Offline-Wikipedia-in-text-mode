 "text": "Herpetocetus was a genus of cetotheriid whales. It was smaller than modern baleen whales, measured just 3 to 4 meters, and due to its jaw structure, it couldn’t open its mouth as wide as them, which meant it was incapable of doing lunge feeding. == Description == Herpetocetus morrowi had an elongated snout and a roughly quadrate skull, and also probably did a feeding strategy very similar to that of the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). Also, Herpetocetus had a unique shape, making it resemble a dolphin rather than a whale as seen by its elongated and a bit slender body. One young specimen discovered in Hokkaido, Japan includes a partial skull, mandible, vertebrae, and a scapula, and this specimen also exhibits a postglenoid process of the squamosal more transversely compressed than in the genus Nannocetus. == Species == Herpetocetus has four recognized species: * †Herpetocetus bramblei Whitmore and Barnes, 2008 * †Herpetocetus morrowi El Adli, Deméré, and Boessenecker, 2014 * †Herpetocetus scaldiensis van Beneden, 1872 (type) * †Herpetocetus transatlanticus Whitmore and Barnes, 2008 == Related pages == * Cetotherium * Brandtocetus == References == Category:Pliocene Category:Baleen whales Category:Cetaceans Category:Whales",
