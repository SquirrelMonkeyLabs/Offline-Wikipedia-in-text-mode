When Ben finds the Omnitrix, a mysterious watch that transforms him into 10 different aliens, a world of extraterrestrial superpowers opens up to him.

However, after coming across a strange high-tech watch known as the Omnitrix, which enables him to transform into 10 alien heroes, he finds himself in the position of a superhero. At each place his family stops, Ben goes from trying to find a source of entertainment to doing battle against supervillains such as the mad scientist Dr. Animo, the dark sorcerer Hex, the psychotic clown Zombozo, the technology-loathing Steam Smythe, the emotionless Weatherheads, amongst other threats both big and small. Despite having lots to learn, he hones his hero skills with Gwen and Max's help. == Episodes == Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 40 October 1, 2016 May 27, 2017 2 40 October 3, 2017 October 26, 2018 3 52 January 26, 2019 November 30, 2019 4 34 December 13, 2019 September 18, 2020 Category:2010s animated television series",
