 "text": "A Stanford torus is a hypothetical space habitat concept in the shape of a wheel of a size range with a capacity for 10,000 people living in it, and a few more visitors, with a similar population density to a typical inner suburb. It was proposed by NASA in 1975. The 10,000 person habitat would be about 1.8 kilometers (about 1.12 miles) in diameter and have an interior width of around 130 meters (around 142 yards). The wheel would rotate once each minute to simulate gravity. == References == Category:Space colonization",
