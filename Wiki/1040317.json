The building is in the eclectic style and is an architectural and artistic monument. After the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, the theater was renamed the LPSR State Drama Theater. The German occupiers renamed it \"RÄ«gas Dramatic Theatre\". In 1946, the coat of arms of the city of Riga was removed from the facade and the coat of arms of the LPSR put up instead. In 1988, 3 years before Latvia regained its independence the government agreed to change its name back to Latvian National Theatre. The Great Hall can seat 850 people, the Actor's Hall - 100 people. The theatre has 44 actors, 21 freelance actors and 14 directors. ==References== Category:Riga Category:Theatres Category:Organizations based in Latvia",
