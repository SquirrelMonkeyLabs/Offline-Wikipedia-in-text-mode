 "text": "Thornhill is an old plantation house near Forkland, Alabama. The Greek Revival main house was built in 1833 by James Innes Thornton. Thornhill was a cotton plantation in the early 1830s. It extended over 2,600 acres. By 1860, there were 156 slaves working on the plantation. About a third of the slaves lived in quarters behind the main house. William Nichols is believed to be the architect. The house measures 55 feet wide. Inside is a 14 ft wide by 40 ft long central hall. There is a spiral staircase at the back. There are two rooms to either side. The left front room was the parlor. The dining room was behind it. On the front right was the master bedroom. The plantation office was behind it. Upstairs is a matching hall and four bedrooms. All eight rooms are 19.5 feet square. The downstairs rooms have 12-foot ceilings. The upstairs ceilings are 11 feet. There was once a brick kitchen behind the house. It later burned. Additions were made to the original house from 1890 to 1949. They were razed in 1994 and rebuilt to better match the original intent. The two-story portico with six Ionic columns was added about 1850. The plantation schoolhouse was constructed about 1845. The Thornton children and neighboring plantation children were taught there. Surrounding the schoolhouse are 230-year-old post oaks. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 1984. == Gallery == File:Thornhill Plantation 01.jpg|South front in 1934 File:Thornhill Plantation 03.jpg|Hall and stairway in 1934 File:Thornhill Plantation 05.jpg|Slave quarters in 1934 File:Thornhill Plantation 07.jpg|Slave quarters in 1934 File:Thornhill Plantation 02.jpg|Rear view File:Thornhill Plantation color 01.jpg|Thornhill File:Thornhill Plantation House 01.jpg|Thornhill File:Thornhill 02.jpg|Stairway in 2010 File:Thornhill Plantation color 01.jpg|Thornhill in 2008 File:Thornhill Plantation 04.jpg|Schoolhouse in 1934 File:Thornhill Plantation color 02.jpg|Schoolhouse in 2008 File:Thornhill Schoolhouse.jpg|Schoolhouse in 2010 Category:Plantations in the United States Category:Houses in the United States Category:1833 establishments in the United States Category:1830s establishments in Alabama",
