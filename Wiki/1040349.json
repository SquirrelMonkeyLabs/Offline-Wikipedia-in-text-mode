 "text": "The Kalpatta yellow bush frog or water droplet call canopy bush frog (Raorchestes nerostagona) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen this frog between 800 and 1200 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 34.0 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is lught brown in color with red-brown marks. The sides of the frog's body are blue- black in color with brown marks. The eardrum is light brown with some green marks. All four feet are gray in color. The belly is off-white with some brown and gray. The frog's mouth is white in color. The iris of the eye is red-gray in color with some brown. This frog can look like the lichen that grows on trees. This makes it hard to see. The feet have webbing all the way to the toes. There are discs on its toes for climbing. The discs are oval in shape. This frog lives in evergreen forests. It lives high in trees where the branches meet each other. When the male frog sings for the female frogs, hsi voice sounds like a drop of water. The female frog lays 40 eggs at a time. She lays the eggs in holes in trees. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, they hatch from their eggs as frogs. They never swim as tadpoles. This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives. Human beings cut down the trees to get wood to build with, build roads, or to make farms or places for animals to eat grass. People also go into the forest to take rare trees, even though this is against the law.Climate change might also kill this frog. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Raorchestes, so they think it could make R. munnarensis sick too. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. People call this the \"water droplet call canopy bush frog\" because its voice sounds like water droplets. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
