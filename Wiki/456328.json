 "text": "The Rhizaria are a supergroup of mostly unicellular eukaryotes. A multicellular form has recently been described. This supergroup was proposed by Cavalier-Smith in 2002. It has many species. They vary considerably in form, but for the most part they are amoeba-like with pseudopods. Many produce shells or skeletons, which may be quite complex in structure. They make up the vast majority of protozoan fossils. Nearly all have mitochondria with folds. == Groups == There are three main groups of Rhizaria: * Cercozoa – Various amoebae and flagellates, usually with pseudopods and common in soil * Foraminifera – Amoeboids with reticulose pseudopods, common as marine benthos * Radiolaria – Amoeboids with skeletons, common as marine plankton == References == Category:Eukaryotes",
