 "text": "Agnes Bluhm (9 January 1862 â€“ 12 November 1943) was one of the first female doctors of medicine in Germany. She was a gynecologist, geneticist and fighter for women's rights. Despite this, she thought that for women, motherhood was more important than a career. She believed that German women could improve the race using eugenics and forced sterilisation. She wrote that the \"female psyche\" made her gender predisposed towards working for \"racial hygiene\".
