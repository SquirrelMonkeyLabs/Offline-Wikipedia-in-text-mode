They are all in the subgenus Sophophera, which includes the common Mediterranean fly Drosophila subobscura and the North American D. pseudoobscura. The group is called the Drosophila obscura species group.Markow, Therese A. & O'Grady, Patrick M. 2005. Drosophila: A guide to species identification and use. London: Elsevier.
