 "text": "The Cecil Hotel is a hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. It was built and opened in 1924. It is in a poorer part of the city, and many deaths and violent acts have happened there. For example, the dead body of a Canadian student, Elisa Lam, was found on the hotel roof in 2013. The hotel changed its name to Stay on Main Hotel in 2011, in order to distance itself from its dark past. Because of this, the hotel is also called \"The Suicide.\" At least 11 people killed themselves in the hotel. In 2019, the hotel had 301 rooms for people who want to live there for a long time and 299 hotel rooms. Some of the hotel rooms are regular private hotel rooms and some are meant to be like a European hostel, where people who didn't know each other would be expected to share the room. The owners rebuild the hotel to make it nicer and newer. On December 13, 2021, the Cecil Hotel was reopened as an affordable housing complex. The Cecil Hotel was part of the inspiration for the fifth season of the television show American Horror Story, which took place in a haunted hotel. == References == Category:1927 establishments in California Category:Hotels in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Los Angeles",
