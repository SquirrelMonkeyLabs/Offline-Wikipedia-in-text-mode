In many cases, it is different from both. Basically, Juche says that: * The needs of North Korea and its people are more important than the ideas of Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism or Marxism. * North Korea is special. * The welfare of many people (who make up the nation of North Korea) is more important than the welfare of an individual. * People must design what the world should look like. * A strong leader is required to make needed reforms. * Intellectuals are important. === Revolution === Juche says that every nation needs to drive forward its own revolution. Three things are necessary for this: #Political independence #Economic self-reliance #Military independence According to Juche, the state should make sure these three things exist.
