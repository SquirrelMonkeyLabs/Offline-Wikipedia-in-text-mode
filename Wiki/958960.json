 "text": "De Vlaamse Leeuw (; \"The Flemish Lion\") is the anthem of Flanders, a region of Belgium. ==Lyrics== Only the first two verses and their choruses are often sung. Flemish original English translation I Ne'er shall they tame him, the proud Flemish Lion, Even if they threaten with chains and roars his freedom. Ne'er shall he be tamed, so long as one Fleming liveth, So long as the Lion can claw, so long as he hath teeth. Ne'er shall he be tamed, so long as a Fleming liveth. ùÑÜ So long as the Lion can claw so long as he hath teeth. ùÑá II Time devoureth cities, ne'er shall thrones last, Armies may topple, but a folk dieth not. Besieged by grievous danger, the foe cometh marching in; We laugh at his anger: the Flemish Lion is there! III For a millenium hath he fought for God, land and freedom, And yet his strength, as spry as ever. If anyone thinketh of him feeble or taunt him, With menace and coercion shall he rear. IV Pardon the brutish who, sham and of faith not, Pet the Flemish Lion then batter. A single motion he seeth not; If vexed he shall raise his manes and roar. V Revenge hath come, tired of their bait; Amidst his rage, he pounceth the foe in spite Which he teareth, crusheth, killeth, covereth in blood and mud, And in victory sneereth o'er his foe's fallen corpse. ==Related pages== * Le Chant des Wallons Category:Belgian anthems Category:Flanders",
