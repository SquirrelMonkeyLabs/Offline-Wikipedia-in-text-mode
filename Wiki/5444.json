 "text": "Yoga is an old discipline of Hindu philosophy. It is both spiritual and physical. Yoga uses breathing techniques, exercise and meditation. It helps to improve health and happiness. Yoga is the Sanskrit word for union. Patanjali was a pioneer of classical yoga. He defined yoga as \"the cessation of the modification of the mind\" (stopping changing the mind). A person doing yoga will move from one posture (called asana) to another, but there are also other aspects which are important in yoga, such as breath-work, mantras, mudras (postures of the hands and fingers), meditation and much more (for more information, check out the Yoga Sutras). For example, the \"sun-solution\" contains 12 poses of asanas, one after the other, and is said to help balance body and soul. There is a specific mantra for each asana. The \"sun-salutation\" is popularly known as \"Suryanamaska\". == History == Yoga was introduced by an Ascetic. Ascetic practices (tapas) are referenced in the (900 to 500 BC), early commentaries on the Vedas.Gavin D. 1996. An introduction to Hinduism. Cambridge University Press, p94. Several seals discovered at Indus Valley Civilization (~3300â€“1700 B.C.) depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose. The pose shows \"a form of ritual discipline, suggesting a precursor of yoga\", according to archaeologist Gregory Possehl.Possehl, Gregory 2003. The Indus Civilization: a contemporary perspective. AltaMira Press, 144/5. Scholars think there must be some type of connection between the Indus Valley seals and later yoga and meditation practices, though there is no conclusive evidence. * Jonathan Mark Kenoyer describes one figure as \"seated in yogic position\".Around the Indus in 90 Slides by Jonathan Mark Kenoyer * Karel Werner writes that \" Archeological discoveries allow us therefore to speculate with some justification that a wide range of Yoga activities was already known to the people of pre-Aryan India\".Werner, Karel 1998.
