 "text": "The British Aircraft Corporation One-Eleven or sometime British Aircraft Corporation 111 or also BAC 111 was a British airliner. It was a twin-turbojet that could carry around one hundred passengers. Some were built under licence in Romania as RomBAC 111. This aircraft is similar to the French Sud Aviation Caravelle and to the US Douglas DC-9. The One-Eleven was retired from service in the 1990s because of noise restrictions. It was one of the more successful British designed airliners. ==History and service== Before the airplane was called the BAC 1-11, it was called the Hunting 107 before Hunting Aircraft merged with British Aircraft corporation. It entered service in 1965, a while before it's competitors. Despite it being a British aircraft, half of the original orders were American. During the 1980s noise restrictions were passed, and most airlines wanted to hush-kit the aircraft instead of putting the aircraft out of service. They did this because at least half of the 1-11s still in service were fairly new; only 5-10 years old. During the early 1990s, more noise restrictions were passed, and this time, the planes were approaching retirement age anyway, so the BAC 1-11 saw most airlines retiring them in the 90s. The last ones in service were testbeds for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, and those were retired in 2019. Category:Civil aircraft",
