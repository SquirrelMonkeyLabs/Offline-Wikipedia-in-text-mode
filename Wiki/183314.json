He urged Sikhs to not just sit in peace while meditating. He urged them to actively join in with other peoples fun while meditating. Guru Ram Das nominated Guru Arjun Dev, his youngest son, as the next Guru of the Sikhs. == Ramdaspur == Guru Ram helped build Ramdaspur by digging a second sacred pool after being instructed to do so by Guru Amar Das. Pilgrims came from miles to hear Guru Ram preach or to help him dig the sacred pool. The sacred pool (Holy tank) was named Amristar - which means great pool of nectar. == Other websites == * Sikhs.org * Sikh-History.com * AllaboutSikhs.com * Learn more about Sri Guru Ram Das Ji ==References== Category:1534 births Category:1581 deaths Category:Spiritual teachers Category:People from Lahore Category:Punjabi people Category:Sikhism",
