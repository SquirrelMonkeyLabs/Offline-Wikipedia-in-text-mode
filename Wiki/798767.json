 "text": "A conservation-dependent species is any plant, animal, or other living thing that would become endangered or die out if human beings did not help it. It is a conservation status. The IUCN Red List is one group that decides which species are conservation dependent and which are not. Some conservation- dependent species live in zoos or aquariums. Others live in places that park rangers and other people protect from illegal hunters. So some conservation- dependent species are extinct in the wild and others are not. ==References==",
