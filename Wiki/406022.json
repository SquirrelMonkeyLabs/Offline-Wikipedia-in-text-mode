 "text": "The Little Pilgrim was a 19th-century American monthly children's magazine. It was published between October 1853 and December 1868 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Leander K. Lippincott. It was edited by his wife, Sara Jane Lippincott, under the pen name, \"Grace Greenwood\". The Little Pilgrim was intended to replace the discontinued children's magazine, Friend of Youth. F. O. C. Darley drew the picture of the boy pilgrim on the cover. In January 1857, the page size was reduced to about a third of its original height because \"it was found that our paper was too long to fit on the book-shelves\". The number of pages increased from 8 to 12 with the height reduction. The Little Pilgrim was absorbed by The Little Corporal in 1869.American children's periodicals, 1789-1872: The Little Pilgrim ==References== Category:Defunct magazines of the United States Category:19th-century American children's magazines Category:19th-century monthly magazines Category:Philadelphia Category:1853 establishments in the United States Category:1850s establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1860s disestablishments in the United States Category:19th-century disestablishments in Pennsylvania Category:1868 disestablishments",
