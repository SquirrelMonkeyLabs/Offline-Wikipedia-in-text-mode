 "text": "Nathan Miles Gale (September 11, 1979 - December 8, 2004) was an American mass murderer who killed 4 people including former Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell during a concert with his new band Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa Nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. He also hurt the band’s drum tech John “Kat” Brooks, taking him hostage. Gale was shot dead by Columbus police officer James Niggemeyer when he was about to kill Brooks. Gale was mentally insane and suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, for which he was prescribed medication. The motive for the crime is said to be the breakup of the band Pantera. Since Nathan Miles Gale was a big fan and Dimebag Darrell was allegedly partly responsible for the band's breakup, Gale decided to carry out this assassination.
