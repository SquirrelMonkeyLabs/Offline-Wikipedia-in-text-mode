 "text": "Jerome Lane Sr. (born December 4, 1966) is an American retired professional basketball player. Lane was born in Akron, Ohio and played at Saint Vincent- Saint Mary High School. During his 1986-87 season at the University of Pittsburgh, he got the record in America for most rebounds per game for basketball players that were his height (6 feet and 6 inches). The following season, he led the Big East Conference in that statistic. On January 25, 1988, Lane broke a backboard with a slam dunk often called \"The Dunk\", prompting announcer Bill Raftery to exclaim, \"Send it in, Jerome!\" In the NBA, Lane had two of the worst free throw shooting performances in the history of the league, including shooting 0-8 on December 29, 1992. Lane played in other professional basketball leagues around the world and consistently led them in rebounding. Lane's son, Jerome Lane Jr., plays in the NFL.
