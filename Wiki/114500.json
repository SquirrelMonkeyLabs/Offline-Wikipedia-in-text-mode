 "text": "maemo (properly not capitalized ) is a project that oversees the development of the Internet Tablet OS and the maemo application development platform. The maemo project is paid for by Nokia. == maemo SDK == The maemo SDK is based around the Debian-oriented Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit, which provides a sandbox environment in which development may take place. Scratchbox uses Qemu to emulate an ARMEL processor or sbrsh to remotely execute instructions. Scratchbox-compatible rootstraps are available for both x86 and ARMEL, so the majority of development and debugging takes place on x86, with final packaging being for ARMEL. ==Related pages== * Openmoko * LiMo Foundation * Hildon * Android (mobile phone platform) == References == == Other websites == * maemo.org * maemo wiki (old one) * maemo planet * maemo Bugzilla * maemo in freedesktop.org * Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit * #maemo on freenode * Material for Nokia's own introductory course on maemo Category:Debian-based Linux distributions",
