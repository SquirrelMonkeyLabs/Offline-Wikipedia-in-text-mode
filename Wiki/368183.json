 "text": "Bolt is a 2008 American computer-animated action-adventure comedy-drama movie, produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 48th movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The movie is about a small white pet dog who lives on the set of a television series and thinks that he has super powers. When he believes that his human owner, Penny has been kidnapped, he goes on a cross-country journey to \"rescue\" her. Bolt is aided by a cynical cat named \"Mittens\" (who was abandoned by her human owner) and \"Rhino\" a hampster. Bolt finds Penny and actually rescues her from a accidental TV Studio fire. Penny, Bolt (who have quit show business), Mittens and Rhino live with Penny's Mother in the country. As for the TV show, it continues with a different \"Penny\" (explained as Plastic Surgery following a life threatening accident) being rescuded by a new \"Bolt\" from the Evil Dr Calico; as Penny and Bolt escape outside a hospital window they are both abducted by flying saucers Aliens! This cliffhanger ending is so ridiculious that even Bolt fanatic \"Rhino\" refuses to believe it! Bolt was the first Disney animated movie to use the closing variant of the Walt Disney Animation Studios logo. It was Disney's first PG- rated animated movie presented in Disney Digital 3-D. ==Voice cast== * John Travolta as Bolt, a White Swiss Shepherd * Miley Cyrus as Penny Forrester, the owner of Bolt ** Chloë Grace Moretz as young Penny Forrester * Susie Essman as Mittens, the cynical stray tuxedo cat * Mark Walton as Rhino, a hamster who watches the Bolt TV show * Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Calico, a mad scientist and the main antagonist of the Bolt TV show * Nick Swardson as Blake, a pigeon in Hollywood * Diedrich Bader as Veteran Cat, a cat actor who portrays one of Dr. Calico's pet cats * Greg Germann as The Agent, an unnamed Hollywood agent that represents Bolt and Penny * James Lipton as The Director, the unnamed director of the Bolt TV series * Randy Savage as Thug, an underling of Dr. Calico on the Bolt TV series * Ronn Moss as Dr. Forrester, a doctor who tended to the fictional Penny's injuries * Kari Wahlgren as Mindy Parker, the broadcaster of the network that airs Bolt * Grey DeLisle as Penny's Mother * Sean Donnellan as Penny's TV dad, an unnamed scientist and Penny's fictional fatherin the Bolt TV series who enhanced Bolt * Todd Cummings as Joey, a pigeon in New York City * Lino DiSalvo as Vinnie, a pigeon in New York City who teaches Bolt how to get his head unstuck from the fence * Tim Mertens as Bobby, a pigeon in New York City * Dan Fogelman as Billy, a pigeon in Hollywood * J.
