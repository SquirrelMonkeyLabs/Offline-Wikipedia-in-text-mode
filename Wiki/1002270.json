 "text": "Mary Ball Washington (30 November 170826 August 1789), was an English colonial American woman who was the second wife of Augustine Washington, a planter and iron ore miner. Mary Ball Washington, and her husband were the parents of George Washington, the first president of the United States. Mary Ball was born on November 30, 1708, as the only child of Colonel Joseph Ball (16491711) and his second wife, Mary Johnson Ball. Joseph Ball immigrated to Virginia as a young child. When Augustine Washington died on April 12, 1743, and when the couple's son, George Washington, inherited his father's property of 276 acres on Ferry Farm and eleven slaves, Mary managed the property for her son George until he became of legal age. Mary Washington lived most of her life in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where many monuments were erected in her honor, and a university and other public buildings bear her name.
