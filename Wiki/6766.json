 "text": "Michael Schumacher (born 3 January 1969 in Hürth, near Cologne) is a former German Formula 1 driver, which means that he used to drive very fast race cars between 1991 and 2012. He is widely considered the greatest Formula 1(very fast cars) driver of all time. He has won seven world championship titles and has the second most Grand Prix victories in the world after Sir Lewis Hamilton. This champion, nicknamed campionissimo by Italian fans of Ferrari, is considered the most popular German personality in the world. Michael's younger brother Ralf is also a Formula 1 driver. When he was small, his father gave him a little kart. It had a small motor bike engine in it. He started getting interest from that time. == Pre-F1 career == In 1984 Michael won the German Kart Championship and went on to win many more. In 1987 he won the German and European Kart Championship. Schumacher signed up with Will Weber's Formula 3 race team and won the 1990 championship. == F1 career == === Jordan (1991) === ==== Debut ==== He made his debut in the Belgian Grand Prix on 25 August. He impressed many fans as he qualified 7th on a track where he had never previously(before) driven with an inferior car. At the start he burnt the clutch and retired. === Benetton (1991-1995) === He was quickly snapped up by Benetton and finished in 5th place at the Italian Grand Prix. He followed it up with 6th in both Portugal and at the then new Circuit de Catalunya in Spain. He then crashed out in Japan and spun in the torrential rain at the season finale in Australia. In the 6 races he entered, he scored 4 points and 14th in the championship. ==== 1992 ==== He started the season off well with 4th in South Africa followed by his maiden podium finish in 3rd at the Mexican Grand Prix. He followed it up with another 3rd place in Brazil and 2nd in Spain. In San Marino he crashed out, then came 4th in Monaco and 2nd in Canada. He spun off in the rain at the French Grand Prix and finished 4th in Britain and 3rd in Germany. He retired again in Hungary but at Spa Francorchamps, where he made his debut, he won a rain-affected race. He came 3rd in Italy, 7th in Portugal, retired in Japan and came 2nd in Australia. He finished the season in 3rd place overall (in front of Senna) with a total of 53 points. ==== 1993 ==== Williams dominated the season with its active suspension, and Benetton quickly made a similar one to match Williams. Schumacher won the Portuguese Grand Prix, and finished 9 times on the podium. However, with 7 retirements, he failed to finish 3rd in the championship. ===Comeback 2010-2012=== In 2010 Schumacher returned to F1 with the Mercedes team. In total he spent 3 years with the team in which he scored 1 pole in Monaco (but he was stripped of it due to a penalty), 1 fastest lap, and 1 podium.Michael Schumacher Comeback Review the seasiders He was replaced by Lewis Hamilton for the 2013 season and retired from Formula One. == Racing record == === Career summary === Season Series Team Races Wins Poles F/Laps Podiums Points Position 1988 European Formula Ford 1600 Eufra Racing 4 1 1 0 3 50 2nd 1988 German Formula Ford 1600 Eufra Racing 7 3 0 0 5 124 6th 1988 Formula König Hoecker Sportwagenservice 10 9 1 1 10 192 1st 1989 German Formula Three WTS Racing 12 2 2 0 7 163 3rd 1989 European Formula Three Cup WTS Racing 1 0 0 0 0 N/A NC 1989 Macau Grand Prix WTS Racing 1 0 0 0 0 N/A NC 1990 World Sportscar Championship Team Sauber Mercedes 3 1 0 1 3 21 =5th 1990 German Formula Three WTS Racing 11 5 6 4 7 148 1st 1990 European Formula Three Cup WTS Racing 1 0 1 1 0 N/A NC 1990 Macau Grand Prix WTS Racing 1 1 0 0 0 N/A 1st 1991 Formula One Team 7UP Jordan 1 0 0 0 0 0 14th 1991 Formula One Camel Benetton Ford 5 0 0 0 0 4 14th 1991 World Sportscar Championship Team Sauber Mercedes 8 1 0 2 2 43 =9th 1991 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft Zakspeed Mercedes 4 0 0 0 0 0 NC 1991 Japanese Formula 3000 Team Le Mans 1 0 0 0 1 6 12th 1992 Formula One Camel Benetton Ford 16 1 0 2 8 53 3rd 1993 Formula One Camel Benetton Ford 16 1 0 5 9 52 4th 1994 Formula One Mild Seven Benetton Ford 14 8 6 8 10 92 1st 1995 Formula One Mild Seven Benetton Renault 17 9 4 8 11 102 1st 1996 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A. 16 3 4 2 8 59 3rd 1997 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 17 5 3 3 8 78 DSQ 1998 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 16 6 3 6 11 86 2nd 1999 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 10 2 3 5 6 44 5th 2000 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 17 9 9 2 12 108 1st 2001 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 17 9 11 3 14 123 1st 2002 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 17 11 7 7 17 144 1st 2003 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 16 6 5 5 9 93 1st 2004 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 18 13 8 10 15 148 1st 2005 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 19 1 1 3 5 62 3rd 2006 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro 18 7 4 7 12 121 2nd 2007 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver 2008 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver 2009 Formula One Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver Test Driver 2010 Formula One Mercedes GP Petronas 19 0 0 0 0 72 9th 2011 Formula One Mercedes GP Petronas 11 0 0 0 0 32* 10th* Season in progress. * Source: Hilton, Christopher (2006).
