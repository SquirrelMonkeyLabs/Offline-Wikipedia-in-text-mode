 "text": "The Mueller Report is an official document. It provides information about Russia modifying the results of the 2016 United States presidential election. Robert Mueller released this official document to argue that Donald Trump had made use of help from Russia to become president. The first half of the report shows that the Trump campaign had many ties to the Russians and that there was interference in America's elections. The second half shows how the President tried to stop the Russia investigation using the powers of the President. Because the Department of Justice works for the President, Robert Mueller suggests that Congress should investigate. “In this context, a balancing test applies to the separation of powers issues. Applying the test here, we concluded that congress can validly make obstruction of justice statutes applicable to corruptly motivated official acts of the president without undermining his Article II functions” ==References== ==Other websites== * Mueller Report, redacted version publicly released April 18, 2019: ** Justice.gov downloadable, searchable PDF ** Archive.org; DPLA ; New York Times; Scribd ** Audio from Audible (free registration needed) * Letter from Attorney General William Barr to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of the principal conclusions of the Mueller investigation (March 24, 2019) * Official Website of the United States Department of Justice: Office of Special Counsel * Litigation Documents Related to the Mueller Investigation via Lawfare * Index to the Mueller report: browse hundreds of Names and Topics, from Clinton emails to Putin to GRU to IRA to Trump Moscow Tower. prepared by WhoSaidSo.org Category:Controversies in the United States",
