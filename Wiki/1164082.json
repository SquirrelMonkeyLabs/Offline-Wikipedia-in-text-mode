 "text": "Chimaji Balaji Bhat (c. 1707 â€“ 17 December 1740), better known as Chimaji Appa, was an important military leader and statesman in the Maratha Empire. He was the younger brother of Peshwa Bajirao I and the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath. Chimaji played a big role in strengthening the Maratha Empire. He is most famous for defeating the Portuguese and capturing the Vasai Fort in 1739. == Career == === Gujarat === In 1730, Peshwa Bajirao I sent Chimaji Appa to Gujarat to make the Mughal Governor of Surat, Sarbuland Khan, give the Chauth to Shahu I. Chimaji led Maratha forces and collected the tax. === Portuguese === Chimaji focused on defeating the Portuguese in the Western Ghats. In 1733, he led the Maratha forces to capture the Belapur Fort. He vowed to offer a garland to a nearby temple if successful, which he later fulfilled. ==== Fall of Vasai ==== Chimaji carefully planned the attacks on the Portuguese forts. On 28 March 1737, Maratha forces captured the Arnala Fort, which cut off Portuguese supplies to Vasai. Over the next two years, Chimaji and his commanders captured several other forts, including Dahanu, Tarapur, and Karanja. In February 1739, Chimaji's forces surrounded Vasai Fort. After days of fighting and breaking parts of the fort wall, the Marathas entered. On 16 May 1739, the Portuguese surrendered. Chimaji allowed them to leave safely, giving them eight days to take their belongings. The Portuguese lost many cities, forts, and villages during this war. Chimaji built the Vajreshwari Temple to honor the goddess Vajreshwari, as he had promised during the campaign. He also took bells from Portuguese churches and placed them in temples as war trophies. == Death == Chimaji Appa died on 17 December 1740, just six months after his brother Bajirao I passed away. == References == Category:18th-century births Category:18th-century deaths Category:1740s deaths Category:1707 births Category:Maratha Empire",
