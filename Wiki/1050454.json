 "text": "The UEFA Women's Euro 2017 final was the last football game to decide who would win the UEFA Women's Euro 2017. It happened on 6th August 2017 in Enschede, Netherlands. The teams playing were the Netherlands and Denmark because they won their semi-final matches. The Netherlands won the final 4–2, and it was their first time winning the UEFA Women's Championship. == Background == This was also the first time that both the Netherlands and Denmark reached the final. It was a big deal because, for the first time since 1993, a country other than Germany won the competition. Before this, only two other countries, Norway and Sweden, had won this championship. Norway lost to both the Netherlands and Denmark in the early games, and Sweden lost to the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. These two teams had already played against each other in the group stage, and the Netherlands won 1–0 with a penalty from Sherida Spitse. == How the teams got here == Netherlands Round Denmark Opponents Result Group stage Opponents Result 1–0 Match 1 1–0 1–0 Match 2 0–1 2–1 Match 3 1–0 Group A winner Final standings Group A runner-up Opponents Result Knockout stage Opponents Result 2–0 Quarter-finals 2–1 3–0 Semi-finals 0–0 == Match == === Details === {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" GK 1 Sari van Veenendaal RB 2 Desiree van Lunteren CB 6 Anouk Dekker CB 3 Stefanie van der Gragt LB 5 Kika van Es CM 14 Jackie Groenen CM 10 Daniëlle van de Donk CM 8 Sherida Spitse (c) RF 7 Shanice van de Sanden CF 9 Vivianne Miedema LF 11 Lieke Martens Substitutions: DF 20 Dominique Janssen FW 13 Renate Jansen DF 4 Mandy van den Berg Manager: Sarina Wiegman Player of the Match: Sherida Spitse (Netherlands) Assistant referees: Belinda Brem (Switzerland) Sanja Rodjak Karšić (Croatia) Fourth official: Bibiana Steinhaus (Germany) Fifth official: Katrin Rafalski (Germany) |} Match rules * 90 minutes. * 30 minutes of extra time if necessary. * Penalty shoot- out if scores still level. * Maximum of three substitutions, with a fourth allowed in extra time. == References == Category:UEFA Women's Euro 2017",
