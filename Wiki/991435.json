 "text": "Louis X (4 October 1289 â€“ 5 June 1316), known as the Quarrelsome (French: le Hutin), was King of France from 1314 and King of Navarre as Louis I from 1305 until his death. He freed serfs who could not buy their freedom and allowed Jews into France. His short reign was marked by tensions with the nobility because of economic reforms, which had started during the reign of his father, Philip IV. He was succeeded by his son John I. Louis inherited the Kingdom of Navarre from his mother, Joan, on 4 April 1305 and was crowned on 1 October 1307. Louis' first wife would be found guilty of infidelity during the Tour de Nesle affair. He died on 5 June 1316 from either pneumonia or pleurisy after a game of real tennis and was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis, where his effigy still exists.
