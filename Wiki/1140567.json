 "text": "George of York, Duke of Bedford (March 1477 â€“ March 1479) was the eighth child and third son of King Edward IV of England and his queen consort, Elizabeth Woodville. George was born in Windsor Castle in March 1477. He was created Duke of Bedford as a baby, likely in 1478, after the previous holder of the title, George Neville, lost it by act of Parliament due to financial difficulties. In the same year, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, although this position was mostly ceremonial and he was largely absent from Ireland. George died at the young age of two, likely due to an outbreak of Bubonic plague. He was buried in St. Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle on 22 March 1479.
