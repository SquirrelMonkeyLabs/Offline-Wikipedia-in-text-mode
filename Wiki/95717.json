Ratchet can use lots of weapons and gadgets to attack enemies, solve puzzles, and jump over gaps. Clank can control smaller robots called \"Gadgebots\" who do things for him that Clank can not do on his own. There are lots of different places the player can go to. ==Story== A factory making lots of big robots is seen. One day a small robot is made by accident. He sees a video of an alien leader called Drek. Drek wants to break up lots of planets, and then use the pieces to make a new planet for his people, because his people'sold planet has become too polluted to live in. The video scares the robot, and he gets away in a spaceship, but crashes on a made-up planet called Veldin. Ratchet is a made-up animal called a Lombax, who lives on Veldin. He wants to leave Veldin in his spaceship, and have adventures. Ratchet finds the small robot and calls him \"Clank\". Clank wants to stop Drek, and wants Ratchet to help him find a superhero called Captain Qwark, who he thinks will stop Drek. Clank fixes Ratchet's ship, so that Ratchet will help him. Later on, Ratchet and Clank find Qwark. But Qwark is working for Drek, and he tries to kill Ratchet and Clank. They both get away from Qwark, but Ratchet is angry at Clank. Clank wants to stop Drek, but Ratchet only wants to find Qwark and kill him. Soon, Ratchet shoots down Qwark's spaceship. After this happens, he sees a video with Drek's army destroying a city.
