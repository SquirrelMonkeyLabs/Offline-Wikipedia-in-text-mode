Each character has their own level, each with a specific purpose. For example, Knuckles has to find and put together all of the pieces of the Master Emerald. The list of playable characters are: *Sonic the Hedgehog *Miles \"Tails\" Prower *Knuckles the Echidna *Amy Rose *E-102 Gamma *Big the Cat *Super Sonic (after the player finishes the game with all characters) *Metal Sonic (after the player gets all 130 emblems on the DX version) == Sonic Adventure DX == Sonic Adventure DX: Directors Cut is an advanced version of Sonic Adventure released for the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Windows in 2004. It was later released on PSN, XBLA and Steam. It contained a new \"Mission Mode\", a Mini-Game collection [only on GameCube and Windows versions] and allows the player to play as Metal Sonic once they get all 130 emblems. == References == Category:1998 video games Category:3D platformers Category:Dreamcast games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog games Category:Windows games",
