The project cost more than $1 billion and provides enough power for more than 250,000 average Texan homes. It is located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of Fort Worth. The wind farm area spans parts of four Texas counties and covers nearly 100,000 acres, several times the size of Manhattan.EC&R; Completes 780-MW Roscoe Wind Farm Renewable Energy World, 2 October 2009.Eileen O'Grady.
