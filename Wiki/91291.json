 "text": "WWE Armageddon was a series of professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) events made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) that was held from 1999 to 2008. It took place in December and therefore was the last pay-per-view of every calendar year. In 2001, Vengeance took place instead of Armageddon because of the possible insensitivity of the latter's name with respect to the September 11 attacks. Armageddon returned the following year. In 2009, Armageddon was replaced by WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs. == Events == ===Dates and venues=== Raw-branded event SmackDown-branded event # Event Date City Venue Main Event Triple H vs. Mr. McMahon in a No Holds Barred match Kurt Angle (c) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H vs. The Undertaker vs. The Rock vs. Rikishi in a Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship Shawn Michaels (c) vs. Triple H in a Three Stages of Hell match for the World Heavyweight Championship Goldberg (c) vs. Triple H vs. Kane in a Triple Threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (c) vs. Eddie Guerrero vs. The Undertaker vs. Booker T in a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Championship The Undertaker vs. Randy Orton in a Hell in a Cell match Batista and John Cena vs. King Booker's Court (Finlay and King Booker) Batista (c) vs. Edge vs. The Undertaker in a Triple Threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship Edge (c) vs. Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy in a Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship == References ==",
