 "text": "\"I Hate Myself and Want to Die\" is a song by American grunge band Nirvana. It appears on the 1993 compilation album The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience. It also appears on the 2004 box-set With the Lights Out. The song was released on November 23, 1993. It is the B-side to the song \"Pennyroyal Tea\". In a Rolling Stone interview, Cobain said that he wrote the song as humor. Saying it was \"As literal as a joke can be. Nothing more than a joke.\" Also that \"It was totally satirical, making fun of ourselves\". On The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience, the two main characters appeared in an intro before the song. They also appeared at the end where they said the song \"kicked ass\" and \"ruled\". Cobain was first going to use the name for Nirvana's third and final studio album In Utero but he didn't think that people would understand the dark humor of it. Cobain said that he meant the title \"as literally as a joke can be\", saying that it was funny and said that it was a reference to people thinking that he was \"this pissy, complaining, freakedâ€“out schizophrenic who wants to kill himself all the time. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1993 songs Category:Nirvana (band) songs",
