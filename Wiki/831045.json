 "text": "The Giant Slalom is a sport where you ski down a hill and make turns around obstacles called gates. It is similar to the normal Slalom except the gates are rather apart so you need to turn more. The gates are more tightly packed than the Super G however. The goal is to go down the hill as fast as possible while still turning around the obstacles. Skiers in the Giant Slalom don't go as fast as ones in the normal slalom but a skier can go as fast as 40 km/h (25 mph) Category:Alpine skiing",
