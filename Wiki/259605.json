In the 1990s, during Mahathir Mohamad's government, Malaysia built the Sepang International Circuit near the new capital, Putrajaya. It was made to host the Malaysian Grand Prix. The circuit opened on March 7, 1999, by Mahathir, at 20:30 MST.

It is raced in a clockwise direction. It is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights. The layout is unusual, with a very long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin corner. The circuit may be set-up with other configurations. The north circuit is the first half of the main circuit. The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.71 km long. The south circuit is the other half of the circuit. The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight. It joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn. This circuit is 2.61 km in length.
