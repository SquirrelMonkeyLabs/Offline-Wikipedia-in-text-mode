The fire was the deadliest in the United States since a fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in 1986. It was the deadliest New York fire since the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911. Almost 16 months earlier, in November 1988, Happy Land had been ordered to close due to building code violations. The building housing Happy Land was torn down within 24 hours of the fire.
