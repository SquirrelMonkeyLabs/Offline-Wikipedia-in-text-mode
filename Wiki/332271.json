 "text": "The Anglo-Saxon runes are runes. They were used from the 5th to the 8th century. They extend Elder Futhark from 24 to between 26 and 33 characters. Like the Elder Futhark, it is named after the first few letters in the series: These transliterate to Futhorc in modern English. The script was used to record Old English and Old Frisian. Inscriptions using Futhorc are rare after the 9th century. They completely disappear after the Norman conquest (1066).
