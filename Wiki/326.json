 "text": "A harbor (American English) or harbour (British English) is a place where ships may shelter. Some harbors are used as ports to load and unload ships. The port will have quays or piers where the ships may be tied up and a transport system for taking goods inland. Often railway and road transport will be used. Goods also move by pipeline transport and by smaller ships on rivers. Harbor means to shelter or keep safe. Harbors can be natural as in San Francisco or artificial as in ancient Carthage or a mix of both. During the D-Day operations of 1944, two artificial harbors (named mulberry) were built just off the beaches where the invasion was happening. == Related pages == * Dock * Marina * Naval base * Quay * Seaport * Transport * Wharf == References == Category:Basic English 850 words",
