 "text": "The Monterey International Pop Music Festival took place from June 16 to June 18, 1967. Over 200,000 people went, and it is often seen as the beginning of the \"rock era\", replacing the earlier term \"rock and roll\". The festival was a cultural inspiration for future events. Many of the performers (like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin) became major celebrities through their appearances, while older acts (like The Beach Boys, who were scheduled to appear but cancelled) were seen as obsolete. ==People who played== ===Friday, June 16=== *The Association *The Paupers *Lou Rawls *Beverly *Johnny Rivers *The Animals *Simon and Garfunkel ===Saturday, June 17=== *Canned Heat *Big Brother & The Holding Company *Country Joe and The Fish *Al Kooper *The Butterfield Blues Band *Quicksilver Messenger Service *Steve Miller Band *The Electric Flag *Moby Grape *Hugh Masekela *The Byrds *Laura Nyro *Jefferson Airplane *Booker T and The MG's *Otis Redding ===Sunday, June 18=== *Ravi Shankar *The Blues Project *Big Brother & The Holding Company *The Group With No Name *Buffalo Springfield *Scott McKenzie *The Who *The Grateful Dead *Jimi Hendrix *The Mamas & the Papas ==Other websites== *The Official Blog for the Monterey Pop Festival Foundation *Monterey Pop Festival Art Director Tom Wilkes * Category:Pop music Category:Music festivals in the United States Category:1967 in music Category:Music in California Category:1967 in California",
