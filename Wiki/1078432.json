 "text": "The Buon Luoi shrub frog (Philautus abditus) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and Cambodia and scientists think it lives in Laos too. People have seen it between 600 and 1200 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. This frog lives in mountain forests. Scientists have not seen this frog in places that human beings have changed, so they think it could be in danger in the future if humans cut down too many trees. People have seen the male frog sitting about 3 meters above the ground calling to female frogs Scientists do not know where this frog lays its eggs. Humans cut down trees to make farms to grow coffee, pepper, and cassava in Vietnam and safrole oil in Cambodia. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
