 "text": "Totalitarianism is a political system where a government has unlimited control. In some totalitarian regimes, a dictator holds all of the power; in others, a single political party does. In all cases, the government tries to control every part of its citizens' lives, and individuals have few rights.Conquest, Robert 1999. Reflections on a ravaged century. p. 74. ISBN 0-393-04818-7 Totalitarianism is a type of autocracy, and an extreme form of authoritarianism. == Description == In a totalitarian government, there are no free and fair elections. If elections are held at all, every candidate must be approved by the government. Totalitarian regimes do not allow people to criticize the government. They use censorship, physical force, and/or arrests against people who protest. Events like parades and rallies are common in totalitarian governments. These suggest to the people that the ruling group is in complete control.John A. Armstrong 1961. The Politics of Totalitarianism. New York: Random House. Totalitarian governments are like police states, except that their police do not have to follow laws or regulations. == History == In some places, totalitarianism is as old as history.Hannah Arendt 1951. The Origins of Totalitarianism. New York: Random House. The Mauryan dynasty of India (c. 321–c. 185 BCE) and the Qin dynasty of China (221–207 BCE) are two early examples. The Zulu Kingdom under chief Shaka (c. 1816–28) is a more recent example. === Modern examples === During World War II, totalitarian governments existed in Nazi Germany (led by Adolf Hitler); Fascist Italy (led by Benito Mussolini);Gentile, Emilio (2008). \"Fascism and the Italian Road to Totalitarianism\". Constellations. 15 (3): 291–302. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8675.2008.00492.x. ISSN 1467-8675. Spain (under General Francisco Franco);Payne, Stanley Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977, pp. 347, 476. 1999.

So did Mao Zedong in The People's Republic of China.Pei, Minxin (2021). \"China: Totalitarianism's Long Shadow\". Journal of Democracy. 32 (2): 5–21. doi:10.1353/jod.2021.0015. S2CID 234930289. In modern times, North Korea (under Kim Jong-Un) is a totalitarian regime. So is Eritrea; Isaias Afwerki has been its only president since 1993. As of 2023, fifty-nine countries had authoritarian governments. These countries contain 40% of the world's population - two out of every five people on Earth. === Partial totalitarianism === Other countries have had dictatorships which never reached full totalitarianism. At various times, many Latin American countries have had dictatorships with some aspects of totalitarianism. Some African countries (like Zimbabwe) have been dictatorships for long periods. The satire Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell was about a totalitarian society taken to extremes. == Purpose == Some historians say that authoritarianism \"does not attempt to change the world and human nature\". Instead, a totalitarian regime attempts to control all aspects of people's lives, including the economy, education, art, science, private life, and its citizens' morals.Carl Friedrich and Z.K.
