 "text": "Phytochromes are a type of protein that is sensitive to light. They can be found in plants, bacteria, and fungi. There are two types of red-sensitive phytochromes. Type I is sensitive to far-red light. Type II is sensitive to red light. The way they work is to control the plant's development. There are other receptors which respond to blue and ultraviolet light. Their pigments are also phytochromes.Bryant D.A. & Frigaard N.U. 2006. Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated.
