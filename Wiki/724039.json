 "text": "Mount Othrys ( – oros Othrys, also Όθρη – Othri) is a mountain in central Greece, in the northeastern part of Phthiotis and southern part of Magnesia . During the ten-year war between the Titans and the Olympians (the ones that existed then) and their allies both sides used a mountain as the base for their headquarters. While the Olympians chose Mount Olympus the Titans picked Mount Othrys. The two mountains were in actuality ten miles apart. == The Black Castle == After Kronos freed the Cyclops and the Hekatonkheires, Kronos ordered them to build a castle made out of the metal found in Mount Othrys. The castle then became the base of the Titans during the war between the Olympians and the Titans == Fun Facts == The mountain was so tremendous, even Zeus was afraid when he first saw it. Titans who live there: * Kronos * Oceanus * Hyperion * Koios * Krios * Iapetos * Tethys * Theia * Phoebe * Rhea * Themis * Mnemosyne The Titans were evil and cruel, which made Olympian Gods the exact same, since they are parents of Gods. The Olympian Gods are actually Titans and the heroes are demi-titans. == References == Category:Mountains of Greece Category:Greek mythology",
