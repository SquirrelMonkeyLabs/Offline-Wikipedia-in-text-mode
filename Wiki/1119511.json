Young Maasai warriors usually dance the energetic dance at ceremonial occasions including weddings, religious places, and other significant cultural events. == History == The Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania have a history that is carefully related with that of the Adumu traditional dance. Although the dance's beginnings are unclear, it is thought to have grown as a way for Maasai warriors to train for combat and display their stamina, agility, and power. Maasai history claims that the dance was first performed by young warriors as a method to increase their leaping and jumping abilities, which were important for both hunting and combat. The dance started to be performed at significant cultural occasions including weddings, religious rituals, and other festivals as it evolved into a more organized, ritualized dance. == References == Category:Folk dance Dance Dance",
