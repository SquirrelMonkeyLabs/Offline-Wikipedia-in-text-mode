 "text": "Vladimir Aleksandrovich Teplyakov () (November 6, 1925 - December 10, 2009) was a Russian physicist who is best known for his work with particle accelerators. He, working with his friend I.M. Kapchinsky, created the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) principle, which was very important dealing with the speed of low energy ion beams. ==Life== Teplyakov was born in the USSR on November 6, 1925. He was made to join the Red Army in January 1943 and fought in the Second World War on the Ukrainian front. After the war ended, he went to and graduated from the All-Union Correspondence Polytechnic Institute in Moscow. After leaving school, he began work at the Institute of Chemical Physics. From 1959-1966, he worked at Chelyabinsk-70, where he kept up his study of high-current proton accelerators. In 1966, he and several of the people that he worked with were moved to the Institute of High Energy Physics in Protvino, Russia. ==Civilian honours== *Lenin Prize in 1998 for his work on creating the RFQ. *Order of Lenin and the Order of the October Revolution. ==Military honours== *Order of Glory, 3rd class the *Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd Class *medal for the Capture of Vienna. ==Notes and references== * \"Vladimir Alexsandrovich Teplyakov\" Translation from Atomnaya Energiya, Vol. 99, pp. 396-397, November 2005. * \"The Linear Accelerator Structures With Space-Uniform Quadrupole Focusing\" June 1979 * \"RFQ pioneer celebrates 80th birthday\" November 2, 2005 * \"Teplyakov’s Proposal for the IFMIF Accelerator RFQ\" Retriever on December 11, 2009 * \"Циклы научных работ, выполненные в ГНЦ ИФВЭ и удостоенные высших государственных премий\" Retrieved on December 11, 2009 * \"Vladimir Teplyakov\" Retrieved on December 12, 2009 * \"Wapedia: Lenin Prize\" Retriever on December 13, 2009 * \"Accelerator Application To Medicine And Technology\" Retrieved on December 13, 2009 * \"Победа в Великой Отечественной войне\" Retriever on December 12, 2009 * \"Путь к УРАЛу.
