According to the highest estimate, the world population may rise to 16 billion by 2100; according to the lowest estimate, it may decline to only 6 billion.]] The world's population is the number of people on Earth. It is increasing all the time because more people are being born than are dying. The population of the world can be changed by other causes such as extinction level events, and natural and un-natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, war). In November 2022, the United Nations said the Earth's population had reached 8 billion. == Related pages == *Population *Overpopulation *World Population Day *Population growth ==Further reading== * YAN Kun(2011).
