 "text": "Ramos' rocket frog (Hyloxalus ramosi) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives in the dead leaves on the ground in forests on hills and mountains. People have seen this frog between 850 and 1340 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Selva de Florencia National Park, Punchina Regional Forest Reserve, and San Lorenzo Regional Forest Reserve. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Hyloxalus do: The tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out because people change the place where it lives to make towns, farms, and places for cows to eat grass, to dig gold out of the ground, and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
