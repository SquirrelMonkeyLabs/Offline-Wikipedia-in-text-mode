 "text": "Redlands (Serrano: Tukut) is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. It is a part of the Greater Los Angeles area. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 73,168. The city is located about east of San Bernardino. The City of Redlands is home to the only museum west of the Mississippi River dedicated to Abraham Lincoln. The shrine hosts major events and reenactments each year honoring Lincoln's birthday in February and the delivery of the Gettysburg Address in November. Other notable sites include the San Bernardino County Museum, the Asistencia Mission de San Gabriel, Kimberly Crest historic home, Prospect Park, and the shopping and dining district around State Street. The city is also home to the longest running free outdoor music concert series in the U.S. Redlands has a long history dating back to Victorian times. In fact, many of the homes and businesses date to the late 1800s. Newer neighborhoods have sprung up west, north and east of the historic downtown. However, the Redlands Mall is now a defunct mall. The University of Redlands, a major private university, is located in Redlands. At one time, this school was a Christian institution. But it became secular in the mid 20th century. The church that once met at the university, Packinghouse Christian Fellowship, still has an active congregation and hosts Christian musical guests almost every weekend. In recent years, Redlands has become accessible as a weekend destination from Los Angeles, thanks to Metrolink service. From a climate perspective, Redlands is in a favorable position, somewhat protected from strong Santa Ana winds and wildfires. However, the area is very close to the San Andreas and San Jacinto fault zones. ==References== Category:Cities in California Category:Settlements in San Bernardino County, California",
