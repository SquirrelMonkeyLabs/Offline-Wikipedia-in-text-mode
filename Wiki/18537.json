The Grammys have 128 categories with 16 genres. The Grammys are awarded once each year and are a major televised event. The award show has its shares of criticism as being biased. The name \"Grammy\" comes from the word \"gramophone\". A gramophone was an old machine that played music on records. The British equivalent is the Brit Awards.
