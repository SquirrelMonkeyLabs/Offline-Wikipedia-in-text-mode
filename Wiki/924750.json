She worked at the First Environment Collaborative. There, she helped found the Akwesasne Mothers’ Milk Project in 1985. This was to help educate others (such as leaders or people of authority) on how toxic chemicals have affected the Mohawk tribe, especially mothers’ milk. Cook is also an executive director of the Spirited Aligned Organization --an organization that helps strengthen the Native community--in the early 2000s. At the Spirited Aligned Organization, she focuses on making sure that indigenous people and the organization are recognized and have a voice. She also serves as an ambassador for indigenous women's and girls’ land. In 2018, Cook partnered with the Elders Council of the Indigenous Justice Division of Ontario. This was in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, an organization bringing awareness to Canada’s residential schools. The Canadian government had stripped kids of their parents and their culture. As these schools tried to Christianize indigenous people, they also physically and sexually abused them. At least thousands of children never came back home after being sent to these residential schools. TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada) brings survivors and families to talk about their experiences to bring attention to the abuse against indigenous people. == References == Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Native American people Category:American activists",
