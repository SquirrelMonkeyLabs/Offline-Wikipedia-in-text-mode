 "text": "The Malaysian bubble-nest frog, Malaccan bubble-nest tree frog, or marginal whipping frog (Rohanixalus marginis) is a frog. It lives in Perlis State Park in Malaysia and scientists think it might also live in Thailand. Scientists saw this frog at night on small plants. The frogs were near bodies of water that human beings had made, in a forest. People have seen this frog 140 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Rohanixalus do: by hatching out of its egg as a tadpole. Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out or not. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
