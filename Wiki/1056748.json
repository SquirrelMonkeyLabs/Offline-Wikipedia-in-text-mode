 "text": "Instantons are like shortcuts in the world of sub atomic particles. They're important in quantum physics and field theory because they represent special solutions to certain equations that sub atomic particles can follow to reach their destinations faster than might otherwise be expected. It's as if sub atomic particles can instantly teleport from one point to another, but magical as they sound , these teleportation-like movements are allowed by the rules of quantum physics.Instantons in Gauge Theories.
