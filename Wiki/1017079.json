 "text": "The smooth-skinned warted tree frog or white-backed bug-eyed frog (Theloderma licin) is a frog. It lives in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Scientists found some 82 and 193 meters above sea level. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 28.0 – 30.1 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 27.5 – 31.2 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is white-brown with darker spots and marks. The chin is brown. The iris of the eye is red in color. ==Home== This frog can live in different places: forests that have been cut down and are growing back, near the edges of forests, and near pools. People saw one frog in a bathroom in Sungai Lasor. People see them sitting about 40 cm above the ground. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Taman Negara National Park, Lakum Forest Reserve, Ulu Muda Forest Reserve, Ampang Forest Reserve, Raja Muda Forest Reserve, Kenaboi Forest Reserve, and Khao Lu-ang National Park. ==Young== Scientists do not know where this frog lays eggs or where the tadpoles grow, but they think it is in water-filled holes in trees. They think this because that is where other Theloderma tadpoles grow. ==Name== Scientists named this frog licin from the Malay language word for \"smooth.\" This is because the frog has smooth skin. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place and because it is good at living in places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
