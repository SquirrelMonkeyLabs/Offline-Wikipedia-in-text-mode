It contains the Australian mainland's highest mountain, Mount Kosciuszko, height . This is one the five highest peaks in the range, all of which are above . The Snowy Mountains are in southern New South Wales and are part of the larger Australian Alps and Great Dividing Range. Unusually for Australia, the mountain range have large natural snowfalls every winter. Snow normally falls the most in June, July and early August. Therefore, most of the snow usually melts by late spring. The Tasmanian highlands are the other (major) alpine region in Australia. The range is host to the mountain plum-pine, a low-lying type of conifer. The region is one of the centres of the Australian ski industry during the winter months: all four snow resorts in New South Wales are in the region. The Alpine Way and Snowy Mountains Highway are the major roads that go through the Snowy Mountains region. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Australia",
