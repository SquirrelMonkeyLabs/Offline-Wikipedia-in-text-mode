 "text": "Player versus environment, also called PvE, is a type of game. The word is used when describing online video games, especially MMORPGs, MUDs, and other online role-playing games. In PvE games, the player fights things that are controlled by the game or computer, not by other players. This is different from another type of game, called PvP, where people fight other people. Players can play PvE games by themselves, with other people, or with people also controlled by the game. ==Related pages== * Player versus player * Cooperative gameplay * Deathmatch * Single player video game ==References== Category:Video game terminology",
