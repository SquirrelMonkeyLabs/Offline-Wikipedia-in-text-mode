 "text": "Interstate 124 (I-124) is an unsigned highway for a short segment of a four- lane highway in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The road has not been signed as I-124 since the late 1980s (it is marked on overhead signs and mile markers as US 27), and the Tennessee Department of Transportation official map no longer designates it as I-124, but some publications still make reference to the designation. It is long. ==References== Category:Interstate Highways",
