 "text": "The George Cross (GC) is the highest civil decoration of the United Kingdom, and many other countries of the Commonwealth of Nations.Although certain Commonwealth Realms have now instituted their own indigenous honours systems, replacing the GC and other Commonwealth awards so far as their citizens are concerned. The GC is the civilian counterpart of the Victoria Cross (VC). It is the highest gallantry award for civilians. Also, it may be awarded to military personnel in actions not in the face of the enemy or for which purely military honours would not normally be granted.Mackay J. & Mussell P. 2005, The Medal Yearbook 2006.
