 "text": "Henry the Navigator was born in 1394 and died in 1460. He was a prince from Portugal, the third son of King John I of Portugal. He was called Infant Dom Henrique in Portuguese. He was never a navigator himself. He got his name because he organized many ocean voyages on which lands were found. He is seen as the man who started the Age of Discovery. He opened a navigation school in Portugal, so the technology of tools and ships could be made better. One of these developments was the caravel. His explorers discovered the first shipping routes directly from Europe to Asia for the Portuguese monarchy. == References == Category:1394 births Category:1460 deaths Category:Portuguese royalty Category:Princes and princesses",
