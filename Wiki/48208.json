 "text": "The House of Plantagenet ruled England in some form or another from the reign of Henry II, beginning in 1154, until the House of Tudor came to power when Richard III fell at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. It goes back to the Angevin counts (from 1360, dukes) of the western French province of Anjou. Three dynasties belong to it: Angevins, House of Lancaster (Lancastrians) and House of York (Yorkists). Lancastrians and Yorkists fought against each other the Wars of the Roses to get the crown for their dynasty alone. ==Plantagenets== ===Angevins=== * Empress Matilda (1141) * Henry II (1154-1189) * Richard I, the Lionheart (1189-1199) * John (1199-1216) * Henry III (1216-1272) * Edward I (1272-1307) * Edward II (1307-1327) (deposed, died 1327) * Edward III (1327-1377) * Richard II (1377-1399) (deposed, died 1400) ===Lancastrians=== * Henry IV (1399-1413) * Henry V (1413-1422) * Henry VI (1422-1461 and 1470-1471) ===Yorkists=== * Edward IV (1461-1470 and 1471-1483) * Edward V (uncrowned) (1483) (deposed 1483, most likely assassinated) * Richard III (1483-1485) ==Further reading== * * * * ==References==",
