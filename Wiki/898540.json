 "text": "The Committee Against Torture (CAT) is a group founded by the United Nations (UN). The Committee is a group of human rights experts that watch and supervise the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Committee is one of eight UN-related human rights agreements. All countries that have agreed to the Convention must send regular reports to the Committee on how human rights are being applied. Once a country has approved the Convention, they must send a report to the Committee in one year. After that, they must send a report every four years. The Committee looks into each report and might tell the country some suggestions on how to improve their human rights. Sometimes, the Committee may think about complaints from people that say that their Convention rights have been broken. Category:Torture Category:United Nations",
