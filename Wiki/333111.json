 "text": "Peyton Place is a 1957 movie. It was based on a 1956 novel of the same name by Grace Metalious. It was directed by Mark Robson. The movie stars Lana Turner, Diane Varsi, Russ Tamblyn, Lee Phillips, Hope Lange, and Arthur Kennedy. Critics felt the most salacious bits in the novel had been laundered for the movie. The movie received nine Oscar nominations but won none. The movie did poorly at the box office until Lana Turner's daughter shot her mother's lover Johnny Stompanato to death. The press coverage of the investigation boosted ticket sales by 32%. The movie became the second highest money-making movie of the year.
