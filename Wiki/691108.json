Organizers and activists work hard to create and imagine another world, or many other worlds, just as science fiction does. \"We believe that radical science fiction\" should be called \"visionary fiction because it pulls from real life experience, inequalities and movement building to create innovative ways of understanding the world around us, paint visions of new worlds that could be, and teach us new ways of interacting with one another. Visionary fiction engages our imaginations and hearts, and guides our hands as organizers.\" ===Teaching=== Walidah has taught in many places, including: * Stanford University's Program of Writing and Rhetoric * Pacific Northwest College of the Arts' Master's in Critical Studies Program * Portland State University's Black Studies Department, * Oregon State University's Women Gender Sexuality Studies Department * Southern New Hampshire University's English Department.
