The game was released on January 19, 2024 for the Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S for early access. In the game, players travel around an open world area called the Palpagos Islands. They can battle and catch different creatures called Pals using Pal Spheres. They can then battle their Pals against NPCs or have them do different tasks. Players can also purchase Pals from an in-game black market. Players can also be attacked by NPCs if they commit a crime. ==Reception== The game was given mixed and positive reviews from game critics. Critics said that they liked the combat, gameplay, and open world environment. However, they said that they felt like the game tried to hard with its brand of shock humor. The early access for Palworld sold very well as well. It has sold over 15 million copies on Steam and reached 10 players on Xbox worldwide since February 22, 2024. It became the first game since PUBG: Battlegrounds to have over 2,000,000 simultaneous players on Steam. When the game was released, many people said that the design of the characters looked very similar to characters in the Pokémon series and claimed that the creators plagiarized them. Some refering to the game as \"Pokémon with guns\". The game's producer said that Pokémon wasn't even an inspiration while making the game. Instead stating that their team was inspired by both Ark: Survival Evolved and Rust. The Pokémon Company posted a statement about the situation, saying \"[We] have received many inquiries regarding another company's game released in January 2024... we intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Upcoming video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Early access video games Category:Indie video games Category:Open- world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Survival video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
