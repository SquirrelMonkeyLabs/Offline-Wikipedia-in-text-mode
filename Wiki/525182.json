He was the governor for territories held by the organization in both Iraq and Syria. He was thought to be the second- in-command (along with his counterpart Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (KIA) who held a similar position in Iraq). He was born to an ethnic Iraqi Turkmen family in the Nineveh Governorate of northern Iraq. == Career == He plays a political role of overseeing the local councils and acts as a kind of political envoy. His military role includes directing ISIL operations against both other Syrian rebels who oppose President Bashar al-Assad's government and also against the Syrian government itself. In November 2015, The New York Times reported that al-Anbari had recently arrived in Libya by boat, where the group has established a powerful branch centered in the city of Sirte. On December 12, 2015 al-Anbari was killed in an airstrike by the Iraqi army. ==References== Category:1950s births Category:2015 deaths Category:Deaths by airstrike Category:Iraqi military people Category:Iraqi politicians Category:Islamic State people",
