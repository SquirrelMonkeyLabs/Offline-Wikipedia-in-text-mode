 "text": "South Park is an American adult animated sitcom about the lives of 24 children in the 4th grade living in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado. The series is made to be watched by adults, but the series gets a lot of people to watch it because of its humor. It uses satire to make fun of subjects such as current events, religion, politics, and pop culture. The show is controversial because of its use of profanity and sexual humor. Characters in South Park include Butters Stotch, Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Wendy Testaburger, Bebe Stevens, Millie Larsen, Heidi Turner, Red McArthur, Nichole Daniels, Allie Nelson, Betsy, Ashley, Kelly-Ann Barlow, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Timmy Burch, Jimmy Valmer, Clyde Donovan, Annie Knitts, Scott Malkinson, Lola, Nate, Adam Borque, DogPoo Petuski and Jason White. These children are 10 years old. The series is about them living in their town. The series' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a movie about the series, called South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut which Parker directed and was released on . == Origins == South Park began in when Trey Parker and Matt Stone met in their film class at the University of Colorado at Boulder. They made a short subject animated short called Jesus vs. Frosty. The short movie had characters that were similar to the main characters in the present-day South Park. Later on, an executive at FOX saw the movie. He hired Parker and Stone to make a second short movie to send to friends as a video Christmas card. This second video was called Jesus vs. Santa. It had the same style as the South Park that can be seen today. == Characters == The voices in South Park are done by a small number of actors. Most of the male voices are done by Matt Stone and Trey Parker. The female voices are done by April Stewart and Mona Marshall (formerly Mary Kay Bergman and Eliza Schneider). Other voices are done by Adrien Beard (Tolkien black), and Vernon Chatman (Towelie). === Main characters === Before the start of season four, the main characters of the series were four third grade students (often called \"the boys\" when as a group for easier reference). ;Stan Marsh Stan is usually considered the serious and sensitive of the group. Stan is able to think clearly and is generally good-natured. Stan usually tries to come up with logical solutions to their outrageous situations. Stan's character is loosely based on the persona (public personality) of co-creator Trey Parker. His best friend is Kyle and their relationship is essential in several episodes, such as when he saves Kyle's life in \"Cherokee Hair Tampons\", \"Cartmanland\" and \"Super Best Friends\". ;Kyle Broflovski Kyle is the most easy-going character and the only Jewish one. Even though he is not particularly religious, he hates Cartman because Cartman is always making insulting comments about his faith. Kyle's character portrays the alter-ego of co-creator Matt Stone. Along with Stan, Kyle often gives a reasonable look on the crazy behavior of the adult world around them. Kyle is often shown as the most moral member of the four. ;Eric Cartman Eric is the most irrational of the main characters. Eric is fat and seems to dislike everything except food. He is often the main reason for the plot of each episode. Cartman commonly acts against the other boys. Cartman often insults Kyle for being Jewish and Kenny for being poor. In the earlier episodes, he would also insult Stan for having a girlfriend. Cartman is extremely devious and seems to be intelligent. However, this is shadowed by his racism and bigotry. Cartman sometimes serves as a speaker for some of Parker and Stone's more extreme commentary about society (three times he has dressed as Adolf Hitler). Cartman hates hippies more than anything else. This is seen in the episode \"Die Hippie, Die\" which showed his career as a 'hippie exterminator'. ;Kenny McCormick Kenny comes from a poor family. He is the most cosmopolitan of the four boys, who often turn to him when encountering an unfamiliar sexual term. Kenny's voice is muffled by his parka. This is mainly because the comments he makes are vulgar. Even though his dialog is not understood by the viewer, Stan, Kyle and Cartman can understand him completely clearly enough. ;Butters Stotch Butters makes very few appearances in early episodes. He only started to became a regular character upon Kenny's death in season 6. He has since been used almost as regularly as the main four boys. Butters is the character that the others usually make fun of. He is nervous, naive, easily manipulated, yet he remains very optimistic. He is often punished by his overbearing parents, and sometimes used by his peers for their own amusement. Butters always gets grounded. To further represent Butters' unluckiness, it is revealed in the episode \"AWESOM-O\" that his birthday is on September 11. Butters became important after he was the replacement for the semi-permanently dead Kenny in season 6. He also has an alter ego which he named \"Professor Chaos\". His character is based on animation director Eric Stough. ;Wendy Testaburger A female fourth grader, Stan's girlfriend and Bebe's best friend. ==== Family members ==== South Park has a number of different families, who represent a common theme of many episodes. There are five main families who are distinguished from the rest of the townsfolk: the Marshes (Stan's), the Broflovskis (Kyle's)(Jews), the Cartmans (Eric's), the McCormicks (Kenny's), and the Stotches (Butters'). These families are important because their children have been main characters. === Marsh family === ;Randy Marsh Randy Marsh has become one of the most common adult characters on the show. His actions in a lot of episodes, such as \"Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow\" and \"Bloody Mary\", suggest that Randy is rather foolish. Stan also says that his father is stupid in the episodes \"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\" and \"All About the Mormons?\". Like most adults in South Park, he has a tendency to get caught up in any trend. Randy is one of South Park's two geologists along with Clyde's father. ;Sharon Marsh Sharon Marsh is Stan and Shelly Marsh's mother, as well as Randy Marsh's wife. ;Shelley Marsh Shelly Marsh is Randy Marsh and Sharon Marsh's daughter and Stan Marsh's older sister. === Broflovski family === ;Sheila Broflovski Sheila Broflovski is Kyle's mother. ;Gerald Broflovski Gerald is Kyle's father, and he works as a lawyer. ;Ike Broflovski Peter Gints, also known as Ike Moisha Broflovski, is Kyle's little brother. He was adopted by Gerald and Shiela. He was born in Canada. ;Kyle Schwartz Kyle Tómas Schwartz is Kyle's stereotypically Jewish cousin from Connecticut. === Cartman/Tenorman family === ;Liane Cartman Liane Cartman is Eric's mother. ;Jack Tenorman Jack Tenorman is Eric and Scott Tenorman's father. He is murdered in Season 5. ;Scott Tenorman Scott is Jack's son and Eric's arch-enemy. === Towelie === Towelie is a talking towel who smokes marijuana. He has a collection of novelty stamps. He often reminds the boys to bring a towel. \"Don't forget to bring a towel.\" == Related pages == * South Park (season 1) * South Park (season 2) *Movies banned in China == Being banned == With the exception of the South Park games, China has banned the South Park episodes, movies and videos altogether.‘South Park’ Scrubbed From Chinese Internet After Critical Episode The following games still exist in Baidu Baike:- *South Park: The Stick of Truth (Obsidian Entertainment)https://baike.baidu.com/item/南方公园：真理之杖/4790450 *South Park: The Fractured but Whole (Ubisoft (由育碧旧金山工作室制作))https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8D%97%E6%96%B9%E5%85%AC%E5%9B%AD%EF%BC%9A%E5%AE%8C%E6%95%B4%E7%A0%B4%E7%A2%8E/17799882 In Kuwait, South Park was banned for poking fun at Islam and Saddam Hussein, so in the year 2000, Director Nawaf Salam Al-Shammari made the show Block 13.
