 "text": "Aleksander Lukin (Russian: Александр Лукин) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. == First appearance == The character first appeared in Captain America vol. 5 #1 (January 2005), and was created by Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting. He serves as the main antagonist of the first Winter Soldier storyline. == Fictional character biography == Aleksander Lukin was born in the Soviet village of Kronas, which the Red Skull used as a base of operations during World War II. As Soviet troops attempt to retake the town, commander Vasily Karpov takes Lukin in as a protege. In the ensuing decades, Lukin became an important figure in the Soviet military and the KGB, rising to the General rank. After Karpov's death, Lukin gained possession of his projects and sold some to raise funds. Five years later, the Red Skull recovers the Cosmic Cube and uses it to transfer his mind into Lukin's body. After the Winter Soldier destroys the Cosmic Cube and regains his memories, Lukin and the Red Skull work together against the original Captain America and battle for control of Lukin's body. Arnim Zola later transfers the Red Skull's consciousness into a robot, freeing Lukin from his influence before he is killed by Sharon Carter. Lukin is later resurrected by his wife Alexa Lukin, Rasputin and Selene, with a fragment of the Red Skull's mind remaining within him. The Red Skull eventually takes over Lukin's mind as a body decoy out of a base in Argentina before Revolution and the Thunderbolts kill him. == References == Category:Marvel Comics characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2005",
