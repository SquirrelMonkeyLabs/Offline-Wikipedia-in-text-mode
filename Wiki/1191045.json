 "text": "Eupsophus is a group of frogs in the family Alsodidae. People call them ground frogs in English. These frogs live in Patagonia (Chile and Argentina). Eupsophus is the second largest group of frogs in Patagonia. These frogs only live in the forests in southern Patagonia. ==Young== In most species, the tadpoles do not eat and grow in water in small hollows in the forest floor or in holes at the ends of water-filled tunnels. Male frogs call from inside holes that they have dug and sometimes fight each other. The male frogs also watch the eggs until they hatch and stay near the tadpoles after they hatch. The male frogs lose weight while they do this. ==Species== There are ten species in this genus: * Eupsophus altor Nuñez, Rabanal, and Formas, 2012 * Eupsophus calcaratus (Günther, 1881) * Eupsophus contulmoensis Ortiz, Ibarra- Vidal, and Formas, 1989 * Eupsophus emiliopugini Formas, 1989 * Eupsophus insularis (Philippi, 1902) * Eupsophus migueli Formas, 1978 * Eupsophus nahuelbutensis Ortiz and Ibarra-Vidal, 1992 * Eupsophus roseus (Duméril and Bibron, 1841) * Eupsophus septentrionalis Ibarra-Vidal, Ortiz, and Torres- Pérez, 2004 * Eupsophus vertebralis Grandison, 1961 ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
