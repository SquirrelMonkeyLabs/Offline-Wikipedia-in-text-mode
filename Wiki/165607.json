 "text": "Racing is a kind of competition or contest where winning means doing or finishing something before the other contestants do. Usually, a race involves people getting from one place to another. Running is a kind of racing where people try to be the first person to run from the where the race started to the goal or finish line. People also race in cars, boats, airplanes and other vehicles, and on animals like horses. Animals and machines can also race without people riding them. Often they race on a race track. A race can also involve any other type of goal like eating. An example is a hot dog eating race, where people try to eat more hot dogs than the other contestants. Some contests are not races. They could involve contestants trying to get the highest score in a particular quiz. Category:Sports",
