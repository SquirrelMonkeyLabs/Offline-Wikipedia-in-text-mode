The name, Antananarivo, means the City of the Thousand. It comes from the number of soldiers Andrianjaka used to guard the city. Until 1869 all buildings in the city were of wood or rushes. Since the introduction of stone and brick, the whole city has been rebuilt. It now has many notable structures. For example, the royal palaces, the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, several stone and brick churches, colleges, schools, hospitals, courts of justice and other government buildings. The city was captured by the French in 1895. Since then, good roads have been built in the city. ==References== == Other websites == Antananarivo Renivohitra website Category:National capitals in Africa Category:1625 establishments Category:17th-century establishments in Africa Category:Geography of Madagascar",
