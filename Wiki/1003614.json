 "text": "The All Saints Roman Catholic School, in Yorkshire, England, is made up of two schools in York. It has been said to be the best Catholic school in the North of England. The Upper School is for years 10-13 and contains the Sixth Form. The Lower Site is for years 7-9. The School was created in 1686. As it is the only Catholic school in the city of York, it is very important for Catholic teachings in the city. == Entry == All Saints is primarily a school for Catholic children from York and Yorkshire. However, it does accept students from other faiths and belief backgrounds. == History == === Setting up === When All Saints first opened in 1686, it was the first Catholic school in Britain to teach girls. 300 years ago, a group of angry locals threatened to rob the school and its convent. However, it is said that Saint Michael appeared on a white horse with a large sword and scared them away. During the 1800s, an additional building was built. In 1925, the school became a grammar school. === Second World War === During the Blitz in 1942, the school was bombed. === Comprehensive Education === During the mid-1970s, the school began admitting boys. It then became a secondary school in 1985. This is also when the upper school building was purchased to accommodate the larger number of students. === Mill Mount County Grammar School For Girls === The school was set up in 1920 in the original Manor building and stables, which were built in 1850 for Charles Heneage Elsley Esq., J.P. and Recorder of York. In 1965, a plan was proposed to merge Mill Mount with Nunthorpe Grammar School to become a sixth form college. However, this plan did not succeed, and the site was sold to All Saints RC School. === St Georges RC Secondary School === In 1985, due to discussions on the reorganization of York's Catholic schools, St George's Secondary school closed and merged into All Saints RC School. ==== Headteachers ==== There have been three headteachers since 1985: * Dr Adrian Elliot * Mr William Scriven * Mrs Sharon Keelan-Beardsley == Religion == All Saints is the only Catholic secondary school in the area. It accepts students from all over Yorkshire. The school has links with English Martyrs Church, which is located 300 meters from the upper site. Every year, the whole school celebrates All Saints Day in the York Minster. == Buildings == The school has recently wanted to relocate to meet the demands of all its students. In March 2022, local MP Rachael Maskell raised the subject in the House of Commons. After this, the school was granted some money as part of the school rebuilding programme. == Success == In 2022, 70% of pupils achieved a strong pass or above in GCSE English and Maths. Almost 50% of the sixth forms' A level grades were at A* or A. In November 2022, the school achieved the fifth position in northern schools ranking. It also won first place in the Northern Comprehensive School, northern Catholic School, and York Secondary School categories. == Former Students == === St Georges RC Senior School === * David Bradley, actor. === Mill Mount County Grammar School for Girls === * Sue Doughty, Liberal Democrat MP * Dame Karen Jones CBE, businessperson === Bar Convent Grammar School === * Isobel McDonald-Davies, Deputy Registrar General for England and Wales * Tricia Walker, author === All Saints RC School === * Anna Docherty, four-time British champion cyclist == References == == Other websites == * * Bar Convent Category:Schools in England Category:York",
