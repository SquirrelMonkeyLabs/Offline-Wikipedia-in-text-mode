 "text": "The chloralkali process is a process used to create sodium hydroxide, chlorine, and hydrogen from sodium chloride and water. It is normally conducted in a tank separated by a membrane, although there are other methods, such as using mercury. If potassium chloride or calcium chloride is used instead, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are produced. When the membrane is not in place, hypochlorites are formed. If it is heated, chlorates are formed. The process is fueled by electrolysis. It can be done in the laboratory. ==Related pages== *Chlorine *Sodium hydroxide *Electrolysis Category:Chemical processes Category:Electricity",
