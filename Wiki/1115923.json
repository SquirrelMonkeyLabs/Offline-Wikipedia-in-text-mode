 "text": "The quinary number system (also known as base-5 or pental) is a number system that use 5 digits (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Quinary is related to the decimal system. Examples are 17 in quinary is 32 and 64 in quinary is 224. When you reach 4 it will not be 5 because 5 is not in the quinary system, so it will add a 1 the front and everything else except for the 1 at the front (first digit) to 0, instead of 5 at the back. Quinary is almost half of decimal (1-25 only, if they end with 0 or 5 (in decimal)) because 15 in quinary is 30 or 20 in quinary is 40. ==Quinary Numbers from 1-20== *Left is Decimal and Right is Quinary 0 = 0 1 = 1 2 = 2 3 = 3 4 = 4 5 = 10 6 = 11 7 = 12 8 = 13 9 = 14 10 = 20 11 = 21 12 = 22 13 = 23 14 = 24 15 = 30 16 = 31 17 = 32 18 = 33 19 = 34 20 = 40 ==Related pages== Binary (Base 2) Ternary (Base 3) Quaternary (Base 4) Senary (Base 6) Septenary (Base 7) Octal (Base 8) Nonary (Base 9) Decimal (Base 10) Hexadecimal (Base 16) Vigesimal (Base 20) ==References== Category:Numbering systems",
