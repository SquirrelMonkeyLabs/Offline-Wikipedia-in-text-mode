 "text": "Necrotising arachnidism is a medical condition caused by a spider bite. The skin can blister, form ulcers, and in some cases be destroyed (called necrosis). It is very painful and could need skin grafts. Doctors are still unclear about the treatment of the condition. The only spider identified as being a causative agent for necrotising arachnidism is the Recluse spider (specifically, the Brown Recluse spider). Whilst It is portrayed by the media to be caused by the bite of the white-tailed spider and the black house spider, no studies have definitively proven the causative link. There is no specific treatment for the condition. ==References== Category:Health problems",
