In astronomy, the unit is sometimes used in kilometres per second (equivalent to 1000 metres per second). == Conversions == 1 metre per second is equivalent to: : ≈ 3.2808 feet per second (approximately) : ≈ 2.2369 miles per hour (approximately) : = 3.6 km·h−1 (exactly) 1 foot per second = 0.3048 m·s−1 (exactly) 1 mile per hour ≈ 0.4470 m·s−1 (approximately) 1 km·h-1 ≈ 0.2778 m·s−1 (approximately) 1 kilometre per second is equivalent to: : ≈ 0.6213 miles per second (approximately) : ≈ 2,237 miles per hour (approximately) Category:Units of velocity Category:SI derived units",
