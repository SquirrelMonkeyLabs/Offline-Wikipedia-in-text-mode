They have an elongated mouth with many needle-like teeth to catch other fish and crustaceans. A diet study of the spotted gar reported the diet of a spotted gar consists of four species of fish; golden topminnow, warmouth, bluegill, and spotted sunfish, which adds to 18.1% of total food volume in the stomach. == References == Category:Freshwater fish Category:IUCN Red List least concern species Category:Gars",
