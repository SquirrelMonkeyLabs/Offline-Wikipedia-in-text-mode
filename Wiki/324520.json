 "text": "In biology, the range or distribution of a species is the geographical area or habitat where the species live. Sometimes, when species are found in different regions at different times of year, terms such as summer range and winter range can be used. When discussing about animals, the species' natural range is often discussed. There are at least five types of distribution patterns: * random * clustered/grouped (most are in one area) * linear (they are in a line) * radial (radiating from a centre) * Regular/ordered (not random, but in set positions) ==Related pages== *Ecology Category:Habitats Category:Population",
