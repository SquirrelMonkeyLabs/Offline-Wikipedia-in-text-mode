It was published on 23 September 2008.

A plaque was placed next to Allingham's home to honor his longevity record in Ovingdean, West Sussex. == References == Category:1896 births Category:2009 deaths Category:British military personnel of World War I Category:British supercentenarians Category:People from London Category:World record holders",
