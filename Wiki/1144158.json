 "text": "The chasuble is the outermost liturgical vestment worn by priests and bishops during the celebration of the Mass in the Catholic Church and some other Christian denominations. The chasuble is typically long and sleeveless, covering the body of the priest. It comes in various liturgical colors depending on the season or specific feast day. == History == The chasuble originates from a common Roman garment called the paenula, a cloak worn by both laity and clergy in ancient times. Over time, the paenula was adapted for liturgical use, and by the early Middle Ages, it had become a standard vestment for priests celebrating the Eucharist. During the Baroque period, the chasuble was modified further to allow for easier movement, and many chasubles became more fitted and less circular in shape, leading to what is known as the \"fiddleback\" style. == Usage == In the Catholic Church, the chasuble is worn during the celebration of the Eucharist. The colors of the chasuble change according to the liturgical calendar. For example, purple is worn during Advent and Lent, white during Christmas and Easter, red for feasts of martyrs and the Holy Spirit, and green during Ordinary Time. The chasuble is worn over other vestments, such as the alb and stole. == Related pages == * Cassock * Biretta * Pallium * Fanon == References == Category:Christian symbols Category:Christian clothing Category:Liturgical clothing",
