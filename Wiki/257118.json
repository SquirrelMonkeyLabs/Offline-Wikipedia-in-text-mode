 "text": "\"Golden Slumbers\" is a song by The Beatles, part of the climactic medley on their 1969 album Abbey Road. The song begins the progression that leads to the end of the album and is followed by \"Carry That Weight.\" The two songs were recorded together as a single piece, and both were written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney). ==Recording== McCartney was the lead vocalist. He begins the song in a soft tone, with piano, bass guitar, and string section accompaniment. Starting with the line \"Golden slumbers fill your eyes\", the drums come in and McCartney switches to a stronger tone. McCartney said, \"I remember trying to get a very strong vocal on it, because it was such a gentle theme, so I worked on the strength of the vocal on it, and ended up quite pleased with it.\" The main recording session for \"Golden Slumbers\"/\"Carry That Weight\" was on July 2, 1969. John Lennon was not present. He was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Scotland on July 1, 1969, and was hospitalized there until July 6. Additional vocals were added in an overdub session on 30 July 1969, the same day the first trial edit of the side two medley was created. Lennon did participate in this session. On 15 August, orchestral overdubs were made to \"Golden Slumbers\" and five other songs on Abbey Road. ==Personnel== * Paul McCartney – vocal, piano * George Harrison – bass * Ringo Starr – drums * George Martin – producer, arranger * Uncredited – twelve violins, four violas, four cellos, double bass, four horns, three trumpets, trombone, bass trombone :Personnel per Ian MacDonald == Notes == == References == * * * * * Category:The Beatles songs Category:1969 songs",
