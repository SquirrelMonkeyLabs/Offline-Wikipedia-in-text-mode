 "text": "Newport Beach is a city in Orange County, California, California. It is south of downtown Santa Ana. It became a city in 1906. The population was 85,239 at the 2020 census. ==Climate== Newport Beach has a mid-latitude semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) with Mediterranean (Csb) characteristics. Like many coastal cities in Los Angeles and Orange counties, Newport Beach exhibits weak temperature variation, both diurnally and seasonally, (however arctic like temperatures have been recorded every month of the year) compared to inland cities even a few miles from the ocean. The Pacific Ocean greatly moderates Newport Beach's climate by warming winter temperatures and cooling summer temperatures. Newport Beach does not receive enough precipitation to qualify as a true Mediterranean climate. The highest temperature ever recorded at Newport Beach between 1977 and 1996 was 32.7°C (90.9°F) on 12 August 1991 and the lowest was -17.3°C (0.9°F) on 15 January 1996. ==References== Category:Cities in California Category:Settlements in Orange County, California Category:1906 establishments in California",
