 "text": "The Olympic Flame or Olympic Torch is a symbol of the Olympic Games. A committee plans the route that it goes through, which ends at the city where the event is being hosted. Sometimes people use the torch route to make a point. During the 2008 Olympic torch relay to Beijing, people talked about and held signs that were against China's human rights record and signs that said Tibet was not a part of China. == References == == Other websites == * IOC brochure on the history of Olympic Flame (1 MB PDF) * Olympic torch technology Category:Olympic symbols Category:Fire",
