 "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic first hit the American Midwest state of Iowa in March 2020. The first known cases were three people who had traveled on a cruise in Egypt. They came home to Johnson County on March 3. Cases were first found at meat packing plants and care facilities. By late October, community spread was a concern in the state. On March 9, 2020, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed a Proclamation of Disaster Emergency. On April 25, the first testing site was launched in Des Moines under the new initiative TestIowa.com. During a May 6, 2020 meeting with Reynolds, then-President Donald Trump answered to the increased coronavirus testing rate. ==Impact== Iowa's largest industry is manufacturing. Most manufacturing relates to food. That means the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the meat packing industry is highly disruptive in Iowa. Iowa State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa expected losses to go past $76 million, $89 million and $28 million, respectively. As of June 1, 2021, COVID-19 was responsible for more than 6,000 deaths in Iowa. ==References== Category:2020s in Iowa Iowa",
