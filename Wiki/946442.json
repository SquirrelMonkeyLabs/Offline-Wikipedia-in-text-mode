 "text": "Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park. It is in New Mexico. This was a cultural center for the Ancestral Puebloan people. The site was active between 850 and 1250 CE. It is an important cultural site from a Pre-Columbian society. The sites were important for ceremonies. At the time, the sites included some of the largest buildings in America. Many of the buildings are connected to astronomy. Puebloan people most likely left the sites because of climate change. Today the Pueblo and Hopi people consider the site sacred.Strutin, M.
