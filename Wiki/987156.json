 "text": "An ice field (also spelled icefield) is a mass of interconnected valley glaciers. It is also known as mountain glacier or alpine glacier. It lies on a mountain mass with sticking out rock ridges or summits. Due to ice's likelihood of being harmed or influenced by gravity, ice fields usually form over large areas that are drained by a river. The higher peaks under the mountain rock that stick out through the icefields are known as nunataks. Ice fields are larger than Alps-based glaciers, but smaller than ice caps and ice flat materials. An ice field is also measurable from an ice cap because it does not have a dome-like form. == Related pages == * Ice sheet * Glacier * Summit == Sources == * * * * Category:Bodies of water Category:Ice",
