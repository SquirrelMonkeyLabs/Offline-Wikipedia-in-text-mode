The Regency era was notable for its excesses, its political uncertainty, and its style. Beau Brummell, Lord Byron and the architect John Nash were important people. The final defeat of Napoleon happened during this era. Parliament became more powerful. A rapid growth in population led to the growth of criminal slums in cities like London.
