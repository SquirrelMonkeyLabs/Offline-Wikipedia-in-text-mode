 "text": "Angling is a way of fishing by means of an \"angle\" (fish hook). The hook is usually attached to a fishing line. The line is often attached to a fishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel. The reel is used for storing, getting back and paying out the line. The hook itself can have lures or bait added to attract fish. Angling is the main method of sport fishing. Some commercial fisheries also use angling. Catch and release fishing is done by more and more recreational fishermen.
