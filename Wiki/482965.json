Ski jumping and Nordic combined skiing were included up to 1991 as a recurring event. Alpine skiing was also included between 1950 and 1953 (in Åre). Biathlon was included in 1984. The event is usually held in February or March as one of the final World Cup competitions during the season. The event is usually held at Lugnet. Sometimes the lack of snow has required the event to be moved to other places in Sweden. ==Events== * 1947 – Sundsvall * 1948 – Östersund * 1949 – Sollefteå * 1950 – Östersund * 1951 – Sundsvall * 1952 – Falun * 1953 – Boden * 1954 – Falun (combined with the World Ski Championships) * 1955 – Stockholm- Nässjö * 1956 – Falun * 1957 – Sollefteå * 1958 – No competitions held * 1959 – Falun * 1960 – Falun/Sälen/Transtrand * 1961 – Falun * 1962 – Falun/Bjursås * 1963 – Falun * 1964 – Kiruna * 1965 – Falun * 1966 – Umeå/Örnsköldsvik * 1967 – Falun * 1968 – Falun * 1969 – Falun * 1970 – Falun * 1971 – Falun/Bjursås * 1972 – Lycksele * 1973 – Falun * 1974 – Falun (combined with the World Ski Championships) * 1975 – Falun * 1976 – Falun * 1977 – Falun * 1978 – Falun * 1979 – Falun * 1980 – Falun (women's 20 kilometers world championship) * 1981 – Falun * 1982 – Falun * 1983 – Falun * 1984 – Falun * 1985 – Falun * 1986 – Falun * 1987 – Falun * 1988 – Falun * 1989 – Falun * 1990 – Lycksele/Örnsköldsvik * 1991 – Falun * 1992 – Falun * 1993 – Falun (combined with the World Ski Championships) * 1994 – Falun * 1995 – Falun * 1996 – Falun * 1997 – Falun * 1998 – Falun * 1999 – Falun * 2000 – Falun * 2001 – Falun * 2002 – Falun * 2003 – Falun * 2004 – Falun * 2005 – Falun * 2006 – Falun * 2007 – Falun * 2008 – Falun * 2009 – Falun * 2010 – Falun * 2011 – Falun * 2012 – Falun * 2013 – Falun * 2014 – Falun * 2015 – Falun (combined with the World Ski Championships) * 2016 – Falun * 2017 – Falun * 2018 – Falun * 2019 – Falun * 2020 – Falun * 2021 – Falun == References == ==Other websites== * Official website * Earlier winners Category:1947 establishments in Sweden Category:Skiing in Sweden",
