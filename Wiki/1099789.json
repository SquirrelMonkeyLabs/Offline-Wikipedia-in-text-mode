 "text": "Pope Obumneme Odonwodo (May 7, 1984 â€“ April 10, 2024), also known as Junior Pope, was a Nigerian actor and filmmaker. He started acting in 2006, appearing in the 2007 film Secret Adventures, along with the 2010 film Bitter Generation. == Early life and education == Odonwodo was born in Bamenda, Cameroon, on May 7, 1984 to his father Luke Odonwodo who is a part of the Igbo ethnic group, and a Cameroonian mother. He lived in Bamenda with his parents until he moved to Nigeria, for his primary and secondary education. He was the only child of his parents. Described by Isaiah Ogedegbe as \"one of the most talented actors in Nigeria\", he was popular all over the world and won multiple awards. He was said to have \"made a remarkable impact during his lifetime\". He was also said to have \"touched so many lives\". ==Death== While Pope took part in a movie shoot titled \"The Other Side of Life\", during a movie location journey his boat capsized in a river accident which initially claimed the lives of three other crew members and later claimed his own life. He died on April 10, 2024, just one month before his 40th birthday. A week later, Nigerian actress Angela Okorie had a public dispute with another Nigerian actor Zubby Michael whom she had described as \"a wicked person\", because he seemed to have hesitated posting a tribute in honour of the late Junior Pope. Okorie had earlier criticized some of her colleagues for posting \"their hypocritical tributes to Junior Pope\". Yet, this same set of people \"never celebrated Junior Pope while he was alive\". According to Isaiah Ogedegbe, the propensity some people have for always posting tributes whenever a person dies underscores the fact that: \"Nigerians love celebrating the dead while taking the living for granted\". Junior Pope was praised for his exceptional acting ability and was also described as \"a man who could act any role he was given very well\". Pete Edochie also called him \"a gift to the entire world\" in a tribute. Not only was Junior Pope described by Isaiah Ogedegbe as \"one of the most talented actors in Nigeria\", but he was also considered as \"one of Nigeria's richest and most influential actors\", with an estimated net worth of $350,000. However, Junior Pope's great contribution of humanitarian action in the Nigerian movie industry has not gone unnoticed, as he was said to have \"made a remarkable impact during his lifetime\" and also to have \"touched so many lives\". Dubbed the \"Apostle of Agility\" in the Nigerian media, one year after his death Junior Pope was seen as having \"captured the hearts of countless thousands of people with his acting talent\". Having been described by Isaiah Ogedegbe as \"a young man who was so consumed with zeal, an apostle of agility, a cornucopia of wonderful ideas, and a brain-bag of creativity\", Junior Pope was said to have been \"a knowledgeable young man who often asked the question: Who does that?\" ==Legacy== Even today, Junior Pope's influence is clearly evident in the Nigerian film industry through his charitable initiatives. He was stated to have been \"an embodiment of love and compassion\", whose \"great impact is defined by his charitable initiatives in the Nigerian film industry\". ==References== Category:1984 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Accidental deaths Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Boating accident deaths Category:Nigerian actors Category:Movie producers Category:Movie directors Category:People from Enugu State",
