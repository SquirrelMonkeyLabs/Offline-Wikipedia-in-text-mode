It is possible that is was named after Colonel William Paterson who also gave his name to the Paterson River and the town of Paterson, both of which were in the electorate. It was first contested at the 1949 election. In 1949 the division included Singleton, Maitland and Muswellbrook. Redistributions moved the electorate north until it included Gunnedah and Mudgee. The original electorate was abolished in 1984. In 1992 it was recreated covering a similar area to the original electorate. ==Members== (1949–1984) Member Party Term Allen Fairhall Liberal 1949–1969 Frank O'Keefe Country 1969–1975 National Country 1975–1982 National 1982–1984 (1993–present) Member Party Term Bob Horne Labor 1993–1996 Bob Baldwin Liberal 1996–1998 Bob Horne Labor 1998–2001 Bob Baldwin Liberal 2001–present ==Election results== ==References== ==Other websites== * Division of Paterson - Australian Electoral Commission Category:Electoral divisions of New South Wales Category:1949 establishments in Australia Category:1984 disestablishments in Australia Category:1992 establishments in Australia",
