The Equinox replaces the S10 Blazer and Tracker. From 2005-2009 a rebadged model was sold under Pontiac as the Pontiac Torrent. The Torrent replaced the Aztek. The Equinox was redesigned in 2010 giving it a more contemporary look. Chevrolet announced that in 2016 the Equinox would be redesigned as a compact crossover, this will allow the automaker to introduce a new midsize crossover with third row seating. This decision was made because of competition from other automakers who offer midsize CUVs with a third row. == References == Equinox",
