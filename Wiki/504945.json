UNESCO designated the systems as a World Heritage Site in 1979. Among the archaeological sites with remarkable caves is Lascaux. == Inscription as a heritage site == UNESCO description is: :\"The Vézère valley contains 147 prehistoric sites dating from the Palaeolithic and 25 decorated caves. It is particularly interesting from an ethnological and anthropological, as well as an aesthetic point of view because of its cave paintings, especially those of the Lascaux Cave, whose discovery in 1940 was of great importance for the history of prehistoric art. The hunting scenes show some 100 animal figures, which are remarkable for their detail, rich colours and lifelike quality\". == List of the main sites named by the UNESCO == Code Name Coordinates Commune 85-001 Shelter of the Cro-Magnon Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil 85-002 Shelter of the Fish 85-003 Font-de-Gaume Cave 85-004 La Micoque 85-005 La Mouthe Cave 85-006 Laugerie-Basse 85-007 Laugerie-Haute 85-008 Le Grand Roc Cave 85-009 Les Combarelles Cave 85-010 Cap-Blanc Shelter Marquay (on the Vézère) 85-011 Lascaux Cave Montignac (on the Vézère) 85-012 Rouffignac Cave or Cro-de-Granville or Miremont Cave Rouffignac-Saint-Cernin-de-Reilhac 85-013 Roc de Saint-Cirq Cave Saint-Cirq 85-014 Le Moustier (2 shelters) Saint-Léon-sur-Vézère and Peyzac-le-Moustier 85-015 La Madeleine Shelter Tursac ==Gallery== File:Lascaux, horse.JPG|Lascaux, replica in the Brno museum Anthropos.
