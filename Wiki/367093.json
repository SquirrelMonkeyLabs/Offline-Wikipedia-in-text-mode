 "text": "jQuery is a JavaScript library created to make it easier and simpler to write JavaScript and HTML. It works on most web browsers and was invented by John Resig. The first release was in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC. Today there is a team of programmers working on jQuery, which is led by Dave Methvin. Today, more than 55% of the 10,000 most-visited websites use jQuery, hence it is the most popular JavaScript library being used today. It is free and open source software and licensed under the MIT License. jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to write complicated JavaScript. Some things that are easier to do using jQuery are: * navigate (move around) a web page * select (choose) elements on a web page using the Document Object Model * create animations * handle events like user actions * create Ajax applications. It also allows programmers to make their own jQuery plug-ins. Companies like Microsoft and Nokia have said that they are going to include jQuery on their mobile platforms. In addition, Microsoft is including jQuery in its Visual Studio software to use with the ASP.NET AJAX framework and ASP.NET MVC Framework. Nokia has included it in their Web Run-Time widget development platform. jQuery has also been used in MediaWiki since version 1.16. ==Release history== Version number Release date Additional notes 1.0 August 26, 2006 First stable release 1.0.1 August 31, 2006 1.0.2 October 9, 2006 1.0.3 October 27, 2006 1.0.4 December 12, 2006 Last 1.0 bug fix 1.1 January 14, 2007 1.1.1 January 22, 2007 1.1.2 February 27, 2007 1.1.3 July 1, 2007 1.1.3.1 July 5, 2007 1.1.4 August 24, 2007 1.2 September 10, 2007 1.2.1 September 16, 2007 1.2.2 January 15, 2008 1.2.3 February 8, 2008 1.2.4 May 19, 2008 1.2.5 May 21, 2008 Fix for bad build of 1.2.4 1.2.6 May 24, 2008 1.3 January 14, 2009 Sizzle Selector Engine introduced into core 1.3.1 January 21, 2009 1.3.2 February 20, 2009 1.4 January 14, 2010 1.4.1 January 25, 2010 1.4.2 February 19, 2010 1.4.3 October 16, 2010 1.4.4 November 11, 2010 1.5 January 31, 2011 Deferred callback management, ajax module rewrite 1.5.1 February 24, 2011 1.5.2 March 31, 2011 1.6 May 3, 2011 Significant performance improvements to the attr() and val() functions 1.6.1 May 12, 2011 1.6.2 June 30, 2011 1.6.3 September 1, 2011 1.6.4 September 12, 2011 1.7 November 3, 2011 New Event APIs: .on() and .off(), while the old APIs are still supported. 1.7.1 November 21, 2011 1.7.2 March 21, 2012 1.8.0 August 9, 2012 Sizzle Selector Engine rewritten, improved animations and $(html, props) flexibility. 1.8.1 August 30, 2012 1.8.2 September 20, 2012 1.8.3 November 13, 2012 1.9.0 early 2013 Removal of deprecated interfaces and code cleanup 2.0.0 early 2013 Dropping IE6-8 support for performance improvements and reduction in filesize ==References== ==Other websites== * * Quick API Reference * jQuery UI * Category:JavaScript Category:Free software",
