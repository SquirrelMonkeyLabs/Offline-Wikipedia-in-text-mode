 "text": "Stellenbosch University (SU) is a public research university situated in Stellenbosch, a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Stellenbosch is the oldest university in South Africa and the oldest extant university in Sub-Saharan Africa, which received full university status in 1918. Stellenbosch University designed and manufactured Africa's first microsatellite, SUNSAT, launched in 1999. Stellenbosch is organised in 139 departments across 10 faculties offering bachelor's (NQF 7) to doctoral degrees (NQF 10) in the English and Afrikaans language. Across five campuses in the Western Cape, the university is home to 32,000 students. The students of Stellenbosch University are nicknamed \"Maties\". The term probably arises from the Afrikaans word \"tamatie\" (meaning tomato, and referring to the maroon sports uniforms and blazer colour). An alternative theory is that the term comes from the Afrikaans colloquialism maat (meaning \"buddy\" or \"mate\"), originally used diminutively (\"maatjie\") by the students of the University of Cape Town's precursor, the South African College. == References == Category:1918 establishments Category:1910s establishments in Africa Category:20th-century establishments in South Africa Category:Colleges and universities in South Africa Category:Western Cape",
