The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) within its arc-like path around the galactic center,http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html NASA – StarChild Question of the Month for February 2000 a speed at which an object could travel around the Earth's equator in 2 minutes and 54 seconds; that speed goes along with about 1/1300 of the speed of light. The galactic year provides a conveniently usable unit for showing cosmic and geological time periods together. Very differently, a \"billion-year\" scale does not allow for useful difference between geologic events, and a \"million-year\" scale needs some rather large numbers.Geologic Time Scale – as 18 galactic rotations == References == Category:Milky Way Category:Units of time",
