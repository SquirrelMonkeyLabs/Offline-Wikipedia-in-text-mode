 "text": "The warty mountain stream frog (Quilticohyla acrochorda) is a frog. It lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it between 594 and 900 meters above sea level on the Atlantic side (east side) of the mountains. This frog lives in Sierra Juarez. People have seen it next to streams in forests in the mountains. Tadpoles from this frog swim in the water all year. The adult male frog is about 36.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is around 57.6 mm long. When it is time to lay eggs, the males grow a gland on their chests and pads on their front feet. The male frogs have more vomerine teeth than the female frogs do. The skin of the frog's back is lime green in color. Some of them have gray or reddish marks on the back. The iris of the eye is white in color with red-brown lines. This frog has disks on its toes for climbing. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
