After a battle of few months Kapilendra deva and his son Hamvira deva defeated the Bahamani grassion and captured Devarkonda. ==Battle== The political situation in Telangana created an opportunity for the Gajapati army to step in and take control of the region. The Velama rulers of Devarakonda in Telangana initially had good relations with the Bahmani Sultan, Alau'd-din Ahmad Shah. However, when war broke out between the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate, the Velama rulers supported the Bahmani Sultanate and fought against Vijayanagara. In retaliation, the Bahmani Sultan sent an army to invade Telangana, led by commander Sanjar Khan (Khwajah-i-Jahan), who caused widespread suffering among the people, selling many Hindus into slavery. In 1456 CE, Humayun Shah became the ruler of the Bahmani Sultanate. His general, Sikander Khan, defeated the rebel Velama chiefs and took control of Devarakonda. The Velama chiefs then turned to Kapilendra Deva for help to free them from the Bahmani Sultanate. In 1458 CE, a battle was fought at Devarakonda between the forces of Odia, led by Prince Hamvira Deva, and the Bahmani army. The Odia forces won the battle, and as a result, Telangana became a part of the Gajapati Empire, with the Velama rulers as their vassals. After this victory, Kapilendra Deva adopted the title of Kalavarge≈õvara, meaning the Lord of Kalaburagi. == References == Category:India",
