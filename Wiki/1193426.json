 "text": "The Away from Home Tour was Canadian rapper Drake's first concert tour as a headlining act. It was for his 2010 debut studio album Thank Me Later and his EP So Far Gone. The tour began on April 5, 2010 in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. It ended on November 6, 2010 in Las Vegas, Nevada. == Background == Drake announced the Away From Home Tour, his first solo headlining tour since his tour alongside his fellow Young Money Entertainment artists on the America's Most Wanted Tour. Drake teamed with Reverb during the tour and it was described as a “Campus Consciousness Tour”, focusing on cutting down usage of non-biodegradable and recyclable products, as well as, using biodiesel fuel during travel between cities. The tour was very successful. It was one of the highest-grossing hip-hop tours of 2010, earning around $8 million. There were plans for Drake to perform in Europe during the tour but they were later cancelled because he wanted to focus on more North American shows. == Set list == These are the songs that Drake performed during the tour. He did not always perform the same songs at every show and also played some songs where he was a featured artist. # \"Forever\" # \"Unstoppable\" # \"Uptown\" # \"Lust for Life\" # \"Houstatlantavegas\" # \"November 18th\" # \"Fireworks\" # \"Killers\" # \"Money to Blow\" / \"Big Tymers\" / \"I'm Still Fly\" # \"I'm Goin' In\" # \"Every Girl / \"Bedrock\" / \"Throw It In the Bag\" # \"Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)\" # \"A Night Off\" # \"Successful\" # \"Fear\" # \"Say Something\" # \"I Invented Sex\" # \"Best I Ever Had\" # \"Over\" == Shows == Date (2019) City Country Venue North America April 5, 2010 Slippery Rock United States Aebersold Student Recreation Center April 6, 2010 Charleston Lantz Arena April 7, 2010 Columbus Value City Arena April 9, 2010 University Park Bryce Jordan Center April 10, 2010 Boston Matthews Arena April 11, 2010 Lock Haven Thomas Fieldhouse April 14, 2010 East Lansing MSU Auditorium April 15, 2010 Rochester Hills Meadow Brook Music Festival April 16, 2010 Morgantown WVU Coliseum April 21, 2010 Orlando UCF Arena April 22, 2010 Greenville Timmons Arena April 24, 2010 New Orleans Fair Grounds Race Course April 26, 2010 Kansas City Swinney Recreation Center April 27, 2010 Lexington Memorial Coliseum April 30, 2010 Syracuse Syracuse University May 1, 2010 East Rutherford New Meadowlands Stadium Grounds Medford President's Lawn May 4, 2010 Worcester Hart Center May 5, 2010 Baltimore Pier Six Concert Pavilion May 6, 2010 Thornbury Township Cheyney University of Pennsylvania May 7, 2010 Ithaca Ho Plaza May 8, 2010 Plymouth PSU Campus Grounds May 12, 2010 San Francisco Warfield Theatre May 13, 2010 Los Angeles Nokia Theatre L.A.
