 "text": "The central Asian red deer or Tarim red deer (Cervus hanglu) is an elk that lives in Central Asia. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says the central Asian red deer is a \"least concern\" species, but many subspecies of central Asian red deer have become locally extinct. This means that places that once had many deer now have none. One subspecies of central Asian red deer, the Kashmir stag (Cervus hanglu hanglu), is the only species of deer that lives in India. ==References== Category:Deer Category:Mammals of Asia",
