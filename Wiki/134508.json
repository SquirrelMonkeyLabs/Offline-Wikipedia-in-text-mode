 "text": "Agorism is a free-market anarchist political philosophy founded by Samuel Edward Konkin III that has the ultimate goal of bringing about a society in which all \"relations between people are voluntary exchangesâ€“ a free market.\"Konkin, Samuel Edward. New Libertarian Manifesto The term comes from the Greek word \"agora,\" referring to an open place for assembly and market in ancient Greek city-states. Agorist theory divides people into two classes: people who make their living through the market, and people who make their living by coercing others (called the \"economic class\" and \"political class\", respectively). They support a nonviolent overthrow of the second class by the first, through peaceful black market and grey market activity, known as counter-economics. ==References== Category:Anarcho-capitalism Category:Libertarianism",
