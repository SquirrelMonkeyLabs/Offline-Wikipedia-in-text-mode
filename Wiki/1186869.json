 "text": "Greta Bösel (born Mueller, 9 May 1908 – 3 May 1947) in Elberfeld, Germany died Died 3 May 1947 at age 38 in Hameln, Hameln, Hannover, Preußen a German trained nurse who served as a Nazi camp guard at Ravensbrück concentration camp. She began working there in August 1944 as an Arbeitseinsatzführerin (Work Input Overseer), acting as a senior assistant in the camp’s labor office. Bösel took part in selecting prisoners for the gas chamber or for transfer to Uckermark, and was notorious for saying, \"If they prisoners cannot work, let them rot\". When the Red Army neared Ravensbrück, Bösel fled with her husband but was soon captured by British forces. She stood trial at the first Ravensbrück proceedings in Hamburg, was convicted of war crimes-including abuse, murder, and participation in selections-and was executed by hanging on 3 May 1947. Her responsibilities included Command (military) prisoner work assignments and participating in the selection of prisoners for the gas chambers or transfer to Uckermark. She would patrol the camp yards and assess prisoners' ability to work; those deemed too weak or unfit for labor were chosen for the gas chambers. Methods of punishment included whipping, confinement in the camp prison (the \"Bunker\"), and other severe penalties. She was executed by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint. == References == *Greta Bösel biography *Greta Bösel at findagrave Category:Nazism Category:Nurses Category:Nazi Germany Category:War crimes Category:German people",
