 "text": "A rotary encoder is a device that can keep track of how much something has turned. This is called its angular position. That information is useful to know how far a motor has turned, for example. Rotary encoders are often used in manufacturing and robotics. This is because they need things to be measured and controlled very accurately. ==Basic types== ===Absolute=== An absolute encoder always keeps track of what value its on, even if it isn't powered. ===Incremental=== An incremental encoder only keeps track of changes. It gives off signals if it is turned one way or another. Category:Sensors",
