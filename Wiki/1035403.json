Her mother was a Native American from the Ojibwe tribe. Her father was from the country of Haiti. She was taught art at the The Ladies' Department of Oberlin College in Ohio. She did not graduate, but left school in 1863 after being physically attacked by racists. Lewis began her career by creating clay statues of famous abolitionists and American Civil War generals. Her work sold well. She made enough money to travel to Rome, Italy to see statues created by important sculptors in history. Lewis stayed in Rome and set up a studio there. She preferred living in Europe to living in America because there was less racial prejudice there. Lewis continued making sculptures of Native Americans and African Americans. In 1867 she made \"Forever Free\". In 1876 she created \"the Death of Cleopatra\". Lewis died in 1907 in London, England. In 2022 the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring a portrait of Lewis. It is part of the Black Heritage Stamp series. ==Gallery== File:The Death of Cleopatra.JPG|The Death of Cleopatra File:Edmonia Lewis - Old Arrow Maker.jpg|Old Arrow Maker Anna Quincy Waterston by Edmonia Lewis.jpg|Anna Quincy Waterston File:Edmonia lewis hiawatha.jpg|Hiawatha == References == == Other websites == Category:1844 births Category:1907 deaths Category:American sculptors Category:African- American people Category:Artists from New York (state)",
