 "text": "The Women's liberation movement is a social movement that started in the 1960s. It is a form of radical feminism. Followers of the movement say that men and women should have the same rights. Important issues on the agenda are: * Women's suffrage - women should have the right to vote in elections. A woman should also have the option of being a candidate in an election. * Gender equality - women and men are equal, no sex or gender is better than the other. * Gender roles should be a thing of the past.
