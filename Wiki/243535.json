 "text": "The 5000 metres (about 3.1 mi or 16,404 ft) is a popular running distance. It is also known as a 5K or 5 km. Colloquially it is called a \"five-K\". It is one of the track events in the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics. \"5000 metres\" refers to racing on a track. \"5K\" usually refers to a roadrace or cross country event. While mainly run as an outdoor event, the 5000 m is sometimes run on an indoor track. Official records are kept for both outdooriaaf.org - 5000 Metre Records - Outdoor and indooriaaf.org - 5000 Metre Records - Indoor 5000 m track events, but not for 5 km road races. Much of the distance's popularity is due to the challenge it gives to both amateurs and professionals. It is a distance race that demands a great deal of endurance as well as speed. Strategies also play a key role, and the combination makes it attractive to many. == Notes == ==Other websites== *ARRS: Yearly Rankings - 5000 metres Outdoor Track Category:Running",
