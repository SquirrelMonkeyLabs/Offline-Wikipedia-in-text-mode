 "text": "A tesseract is a 4-dimensional object with eight cells. Each cell is a cube. Together, each cell makes the surface of the tesseract. Unlike three- dimensional objects which rotate on both an axis and a plane (the plane being two dimensions and the axis being of the leftover dimension, height), a tesseract rotates on two planes, one made up of two dimensions, and another made up of the other two dimensions. It is not possible to make a tesseract out of real materials. A tesseract is in four dimensions, but we can only move in three dimensions. A Line is to the 1st dimension, Square is to the 2nd dimension, Cube is to the 3rd dimension, Tesseract is to the 4th dimension. Due to tesseracts being 4D, it is impossible to completely accurately render it in a 3D universe, on a 2D screen. This is similar to how projecting a 3d cube to make an image always causes distortions, except in 3D we don't notice. ==References== Category:Topology Category:Shapes",
