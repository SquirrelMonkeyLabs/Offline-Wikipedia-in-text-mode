 "text": "The Libertarian Party Mises Caucus (LPMC), also known as the Mises Caucus, is a political faction and caucus of the Libertarian Party. It was founded in 2017 by the paleolibertarian faction of the party. It was inspired by the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns of Ron Paul. The Mises Caucus got total control of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC) in 2022. This caused a conflict between the LPMC and the Classical Liberal Caucus (CLC). The founder and chairman of the LPMC is Michael Heise of the Mises Institute. He founded the caucus in response to the struggle between classical liberals and paleolibertarians in August 2017 triggered by the Unite the Right rally. Since then, many notable people in the Libertarian Party have joined it. Some of these people are Ron Paul, Dave Smith, Tom Woods, and Scott Horton. Angela McArdle, Chairwoman of the LNC, is a member of the LPMC as well. == History == In August 2017, the Unite the Right rally occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia to protest the proposed removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Jeff Deist, the President of the Mises Institute, supported the protest. The LNC heavily scrutinized the Mises Institute as a result, accusing Deist of being a White nationalist. The caucus is widely described as white nationalist. The struggle that followed between self-described classical liberals and self- described paleolibertarians resulted in Michael Heise and the latter founding the Mises Caucus. In 2022, the Mises Caucus took control of the highest positions of power throughout the LNC. Angela McArdle of the Mises Caucus was elected the new Chairwoman of the Libertarian Party with 69% of the delegates. The former leadership of the party became heavily critical of the new LPMC leadership, forming the Classical Liberal Caucus in reaction. In spite of resistance from the CLC, the LPMC used their power in the LNC to bring the Libertarian Party into the anti-war movement. The Libertarian Party began working with the People's Party to organize new anti-war protests. This resulted in Rage Against the War Machine, a major anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. on February 19, 2023. The rally focused primarily on the United States' involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War and the torture of Julian Assange. == Advisory Board == The Advisory Board is a group of 11 individuals who, alongside Chairman Michael Heise, run the Mises Caucus. The members are: * Ron Paul * Tom Woods * Dave Smith * Scott Horton * Michael Boldin * Maj Toure * Walter Block * Gene Epstein * Larry Sharpe * Jim Cantrell * Murray Sabrin == Relationship with other parties == === Republican Party === An offshoot of the Mises Caucus was founded within the Republican Party in 2021, known as the GOP Mises Caucus. The GOP Mises Caucus advocates for economic growth and tax resistance. It is a firm opponent of COVID-19 lockdowns, referring to it as the \"Covid Regime.\" === People's Party === In 2023, the Mises Caucus and the People's Party collaborated to launch an anti- war protest on February 19 known as Rage Against the War Machine. == Election tickets == === Presidential elections === Libertarian Party Mises Caucus candidates for president Year Candidate Primary election vote General election vote Result 2020 Jacob Hornberger 27.8% Failed to qualify 2024 Michael Rectenwald 2.1% To be determined === LNC Chair elections === Libertarian Party Mises Caucus candidates for chair Year Candidate Vote Result 2018 Joshua Smith 22% Lost 2020 39% 2022 Angela McArdle 69% Won 2024 To be determined == References == Category:Libertarian Party (United States)",
