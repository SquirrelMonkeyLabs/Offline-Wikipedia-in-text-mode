In 1904, the Brandt brothers died, and the company came into the hands of their children. In the following years, Omega became a highly prestigious watch manufacturer. In 1925, Omega started to work with Tissot, another watch manufacturer. Today Omega belongs to the Swatch Group. == Advertising == ===James Bond=== Many filmmakers have Omega watches in their movies.
