 "text": ", known as Starwing in Europe, is a video game that was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo. == Super Nintendo == It was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first game in the Star Fox series. It was the first three-dimensional Nintendo video game. It was released in Japan on February 21, 1993, in North America on March 23, 1993, and in Europe on June 3, 1993. It uses the Super FX chip, which improves the graphics display. The story involves Fox McCloud and his Star Fox team defending their home of Corneria from Andross, the game's main villain. The gameplay involves guiding Fox's spacecraft, an Arwing, through stages while destroying enemies. Power-ups are placed in stages to help the player. The player must also defend their teammates from enemies. At the end of each stage is a boss. After completing a stage, the player is given a score based on how many enemies they destroyed and how well they defended their teammates. == Development == The game was released in the spring of 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and quickly became a phenomenon. Before it was even released, preorders exceeded 1.7 million copies. In order to keep up with the preorder demand Nintendo shipped a million game cartridges on the game's opening weekend, some dropped by parachute to stores such as Sears. To promote the game, Nintendo created Star Fox-themed kiosks which loosely resembled an Arwing and sent them to Sears stores. A TV with a VCR stood next to the kiosk, and if one sat in a chair inside the kiosk then it would rumble in response to the actions on-screen. Another game promotion was the Super Star Fox Weekend competition, in which specially rigged Star Fox game cartridges set to time themselves for four minutes were played. The objective of the competition was to get the highest score by shooting down the most enemies within the time limit. Prizes included a free trip to one of four locations around the globe, along with flight pins, flights jackets and other assorted winnings. ==References== Category:1993 video games Category:Star Fox Category:Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development games Category:Rail shooters Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games about animals Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life",
