 "text": "In mathematics, a constructive proof is a method of proof that shows the existence of a mathematical objectâ€”by giving a method on how to create the object. The other type of proof is called non-constructive proof, or existence proof: It shows that an object must exist, but does not give a way how to construct it. A non-constructive proof is rejected by the so-called constructivists, who choose to interpret existence in a stricter way. == Related pages == * Proof by contradiction == References == Category:Mathematics",
