 "text": "A Marilyn is a mountain or hill in the British Isles (including Ireland) with a relative height of at least 150 metres (492 ft). The name was coined as an ironic contrast to the designation Munro, that is used of a Scottish mountain with a height of more than 3,000 feet, which is homophonous with (Marilyn) Monroe. There are currently 1556 Marilyns identified in Great Britain and surrounding islands: 1218 in Scotland, 174 in England, 159 in Wales and 5 on the Isle of Man. Many of the largest hills are Marilyns, including Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon. On the other hand, many large hills, including some Munros, and other well-known hills are not Marilyns because they do not meet the relative height criterion, like Scafell, Bow Fell in the Lake District and four thousand footers Cairngorm and Aonach Mor in Scotland. ==Other websites== * Marilyn News Centre * Lakes24 24 Marilyns in 24 hours in the English Lake District Category:Hills of the United Kingdom \\+ Category:Geography of Ireland",
