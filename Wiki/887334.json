 "text": "\"Rappin' for Jesus\" is a parody song from 2013. Brian Spinney uploaded it to YouTube, where it has over 92 million views, on February 5, 2013, saying he directed it in high school and Pastor Jim Colerick and his wife Mary Sue wrote it for a Christian youth outreach program by West Dubuque 2nd Church of Christ in Dubuque, Iowa. It became more well known using Reddit. The video links to the church's website, which says it was closed in 2004. It and Brian's YouTube channel were made on January 15, 2013, so The Daily Dot said it and the song are fake. The Huffington Post did not know if it was, but said it is \"Very peculiar indeed\". Chris English, pastor of GracePoint Church in Dubuque, Iowa, emailed The Christian Post to say he had never heard of the song's pastor or church, and the use of the word nigga was \"clearly over the line, and offensive\", and it would not work because it had many negative stereotypes about Christians. The Dallas Observer said \"it's cheesy. It's bad. It's painful.\" and it made Christian rap look bad. == References == == Other websites == * Rappin' for Jesus on YouTube Category:2013 songs Category:Music memes Category:Parodies",
