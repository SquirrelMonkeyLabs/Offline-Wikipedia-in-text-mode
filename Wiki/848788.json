The adult male frog is about 44.5 to 60.7 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 72.9 to 90.5 mm long. They live in forests that can be flooded or dry. This frog is the color of dark or light coffee. This frog's name, ventrimaculata, has the Latin word for \"stain\" in it. This is because the frog looks like it has coffee stains on its skin. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
