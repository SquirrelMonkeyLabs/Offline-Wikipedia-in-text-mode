In 2007 her set of memoirs A Russian Diary: A Journalist's Final Account of Life, Corruption, and Death in Putin's Russia was published in English. == Death == On 7 October 2006, she was shot dead at her house in Moscow. It is possible she was murdered for political reasons. Some Western countries have asked for a thorough investigation of her death. They saw it as an attempt to end opposition to the Russian regime, as perhaps one of the last chances to save the freedom of the press in Russia. The Noyava Gazeta has put up a reward for information that can explain why she was killed. ==Related pages== *American people of Ukrainian descent *Boris Berezovsky == References == Category:1958 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Russian activists Category:Russian journalists Category:Murders by firearm in Russia Category:Russian murder victims Category:Russian writers Category:Unsolved murders Category:Writers from New York City",
