 "text": "The European Investment Bank (EIB) is an international bank owned by the EU member states. It was created in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome as a \"policy- driven bank\" using financing operations to further EU policy goals such as European integration and social cohesion. It should not be confused with the European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt (Germany) or with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) which is based in London (United Kingdom). The member states set the bank's broad policy goals and oversee the decision-making bodies of the bank: its board of governors and board of directors. It is the world's largest international public lending institution. == Other websites == * Official website Category:1958 establishments in Europe Category:Banks of Europe Category:European Union",
