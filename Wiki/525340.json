During the winter they also eat grain and vegetables from the fields. Young birds often eat insects. The nest is a large pile of plant matter built on dry ground or on small islands near lakeshore. The same nest mound may be used over many years although it is often repaired and new material is added. == Distribution == Whooper swans spends their summer in Northern Europe and Asia. For winter they migrate to coasts where sea does not freeze. In year 2006 it was estimated, that there are more than 180,000 whooper swans in the world. Out of these, 10,000-100,000 pairs breed in Russia. Between one thousand and ten thousand birds also spend their winter there.Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus BirdLife International ==References== Category:Swans Category:Birds of Europe Category:Birds of Asia Category:National symbols of Finland",
