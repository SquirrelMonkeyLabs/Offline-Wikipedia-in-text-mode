 "text": "The Wind River Indian Reservation is a place in Wyoming in the United States where Native Americans live. Eastern Shoshone and the Northern Arapaho live there. It is the seventh largest reservation in the United States. Wind River is in size. Wind River Reservation was started in 1868 for the Eastern Shoshone. The Arapaho came later. The Arapaho tried to get along with whites and help the government, so sometimes the government gave them more land or help, even though that was not always legal. Fort Washakie is in Wind River. Before 1868, it was called Fort Brown. The Buffalo Soldiers were stationed there. Sacagawea, the woman who went with Lewis and Clark is buried there. Some of the powwows at Wind River are open to the public. There are many museums and cultural centers. ==References== Category:Geography of Wyoming Category:Native Americans",
