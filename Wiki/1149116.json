He is the author of Shomporko, Bondhutto O Rajniti, a nonfiction book published in 2014 that sparked both debate and criticism for its ideas on friendship (Bengali: বন্ধুত্ব), critique of modern politics, and its exploration of the complexities of political practices in post-independence Bangladesh. For over a decade, his books, op-eds, public lectures, and interviews have profoundly influenced young writers and thinkers in Bangladesh. == Biography == In 2013, Rifat was one of the first few intellectuals to denounce the massive Shahbag demonstrations, termed the movement as fascist in nature and inimical to the idea of justice. In a March 2014 interview, he further condemned Shahbag protesters for restricting liberal discourse in society and failing to critically assess the war crimes tribunal under Sheikh Hasina’s regime, which, to rifat, created a point of no return in Bangladeshi politics and society. Following the 2024 Student–People's uprising in Bangladesh, Rifat Hasan's proposal for post-fascist restructuring and constitutional reform gained prominence. In his After Fascist manifesto, Hasan argues that the current constitution has lost its ethical authority, especially after the July massacre, and calls for a new constitution to restore public ownership of the country. He proposes forming an all-party Guardian Council to oversee the drafting process, with a constitutional reform commission preparing a draft to be adopted through a referendum. In a December 2024 public speech, Hasan emphasized the value of public dialogue over intellectual discussions. He proposed a referendum to address the debate on whether fascists have the right to engage in politics, including participation in elections, and on adopting a new constitution for the post-fascist era. To him, decisions on such matters cannot be left to vested BNP and Jamaat leaders, as the true stakeholders are the common people. Without the consent of the masses, no commission has the legitimacy to endorse the rehabilitation of fascists. == Criticism == Several critics harshly condemned Rifat in 2013 for allegedly defending the views of Hefazat and accused war criminals. Progressive left activists claimed Rifat’s stance on the Shahbagh movement was overly lenient toward Jamaat-e-Islami’s position on the 1971 Liberation War and sympathetic to Hefazat, arguing that he was more critical of the Shahbagh uprising than of these groups. In 2024, Mixed reactions have emerged in response to Hasan’s proposal for an all-party Guardian Council. Justice M.A. Matin, a retired judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, and Ridwanul Hoque, a constitutional expert, see the Guardian Council as essential for reform process. However, they note that a constitution is more than a written document; under this same constitution, Bangladesh has at times experienced better governance than at others. Others, like Nayel Rahman, view Hasan’s call to rewrite the constitution as a bold move for change in Bangladesh. == Books == === Prose === * Shomporko, Bondhutto O Rajniti (Relations, Friendship and Politics, 2014) * Ei Shomoiti Apni Kibhabe Udjapon Korben (How to celebrate this fascist time, 2016) * Text, Conspiracy O Rupkotha (Text, Conspiracy and FairyTale, 2021) * Moddhoborti Benchtate (On the middle bench, 2025) === Interview === * Memories of Fascism: Collected Interviews of Rifat Hasan, 2025 === Poetry === * Jolladkhanai Boisha KobitaPat (Reading poetry in a slaughterhouse, 2020) == References == Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Writers",
