 "text": "Tron otherwise referred to as GX-12, is a 1982 American science fiction movie released by Walt Disney Pictures. The movie stars Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn (and Gold-Clu System), Bruce Boxleitner as Dr. Alan T. Bradley (and Blue- Tron), Cindy Morgan as Dr. Lora Baines (and Yori), Dan Shor as Roy Zack Kleinberg (and Ram), Barnard Hughes as Dr. Walter Gibbs, Ph.D. (and Dumont), Peter Jurasik as Crom Henderson and Edie Mirman as the Encom 511 Mainframe. David Warner plays the villain Ed Dillinger (and Cmdr. Dr. Red-Sark, as well as the voice of the Master Control Program Cone General Hologram) and Stuart Thomas plays the henchman Peter (and Lt. Alu). It was directed by Steven Lisberger. As one of the first movies to use computer animations extensively, Tron has a distinctive visual style. The music for the movie was written by Wendy Carlos, and there were also two songs from the band Journey. Even though it got mixed success soon after its debut, Tron has gained a cult following thanks to its computer-generated imagery (CGI) and hero story. Several video games have been based on it. A twentieth anniversary DVD edition came out in 2002. In early 2005, Disney revealed plans for a sequel. The sequel was called Tron Legacy and was released in 2010. It tells the story of Flynn's son Sam. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1982 science fiction movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:Cult movies Category:Disney movies Category:English-language movies",
