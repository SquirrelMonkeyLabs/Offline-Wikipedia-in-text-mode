 "text": "Loa are the spirits of Voodoo. They are also referred to as \"mystères\" and \"the invisibles\" and are intermediaries between Bondye (from French Bon Dieu, meaning \"good God\") and humanity.Anthony B. Pinn. \"The African American Religious Experience in America\" Greenwood Press, 2005. They have their own personal likes and dislikes, songs, dances, ritual symbols (Veve), and special modes of service. The word Loa (lwa) comes from Yoruba olúwa (meaning \"lord\" or \"God\"). There are many families of loa: Rada (also Radha), Petro (also Pethro, Petwo), Agwé, Nago, Kongo and Ghede (also Guede, or Gede) among others. In a ritual the loa are called down by the houngan (priest) or mambo (priestess) to take part in the service, receive offerings, and grant requests. ==References== Category:Mythology Category:Afro-American religion",
