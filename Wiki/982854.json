 "text": "Pachycormiformes is an extinct order of marine ray-finned fish. They lived in the the early Jurassic period to the end of the Cretaceous. It only includes a single family, the Pachycormidae. They were characterized by having serrated pectoral fins (though more recent studies demonstrated that fin shape diversity in this group was high), reduced pelvic fins and a bony rostrum. == Relationships == Pachycormiformes were probably members of the Teleosteomorpha. This was a group which includes all fish more closely related to modern teleosts than to Holostei. This is a group which includes the bowfin and gars. == Taxonomy == * Euthynotus Wagner, 1860 * Haasichthys Delsate, 1999 * Notodectes Dolgopol de Saez, 1949 * Pseudoasthenocormus * Sauropsis Agassiz, 1843 * Hypsocorminae Vetter, 1881 ** Australopachycormus Kear, 2007 ** Hypsocormus Wagner, 1860 ** Kaykay Gouiric-Cavalli & Arratia, 2022 ** Orthocormus Weitzel, 1930 ** Protosphyraena Leidy, 1857 ** Simocormus Maxwell et al., 2020 * Asthenocorminae Cooper et al., 2022 ** Germanostomus Cooper et al., 2022 ** Ohmdenia Hauff, 1953 ** Pachycormus Agassiz, 1833 ** Saurostomus Agassiz, 1843 ** Suspension-feeding clade *** Asthenocormus Woodward, 1895 *** Bonnerichthys Friedman et al., 2010 *** Leedsichthys Woodward, 1889 *** Martillichthys Liston, 2008 *** Rhinconichthys Friedman et al., 2010 == Related pages == * Leedsichthys * Bobasatraniiformes * Ellimmichthyiformes == References == Category:Ray-finned fish Category:Extinct fish",
