 "text": "Osmosis Jones is a 2001 live-action/animated science fiction comedy movie directed by the Farrelly brothers. It is mostly set in the human body. ==Cast== ===Live-Action Cast=== *Bill Murray as Frank Detorre *Chris Elliott as Bob Detorre *Molly Shannon as Mrs. Boyd ===Voice Cast=== *Chris Rock as Osmosis \"Ozzy\" Jones *David Hyde Pierce as Drixenol Koldreliff *Brandy as Leah Estrogen *Laurence Fishburne as Thrax *William Shatner as Mayor Phlemming *Ron Howard as Tom Colonic *Carlos Alazraqui as Latino Germ *Richard Steven Horvitz as Dream Ticket Seller *Rodger Bumpass as Joe Cramp ==Production== The movie was going to be rated PG-13 with raunchy scenes involving Ozzy and Drix visiting Gonad's Gym (Frank's testicles) and that there would be more swearing. The swearing was overdubbed, for example, in the first cut, Ozzy says \"What the hell is a uvula?\" In the final cut, \"hell\" is replaced with \"heck\". ==Reception== The movie flopped at the box office with mixed reviews but was able to make it's budget back with home video sales.
