 "text": "The stylophthalmine trait is a trait used by the larvae of a few ray-finned fishes. The fish will develop elliptically shaped eyes found in long peduncles. This trait has been developed twice in the families Myctophidae (in species of Myctophum and Symbolophorus), Stomiidae (genus Idiacanthus), and Bathylagidae (Bathylagus). Three species with this trait were placed in the genus Stylophthalmus. Now, that genus is disputed. == References == # King, D.
