 "text": "In mathematics, an equivalence relation R on a set is a mathematical relation that is symmetric, transitive and reflexive. For a given element a on that set, the set of all elements related to a (in the sense of R) is called the equivalence class of a, and written as [a]. With an equivalence relation, it is possible to partition a set into distinct equivalence classes. As an example, consider the set of all animals on a farm and define the following relation: two animals are related if they belong to the same species. Under this relation, a cow is related to an ox, but not to a chicken. In fact, this relation is an equivalence relation because: *It is reflexive: each animal is of the same species as itself *It is symmetric: if a first animal is in the same species as a second animal, then the second animal is also in the same species as the first animal. *It is transitive: if a first animal is in the same species as a second animal, and the second animal is in the same species as a third animal, then the first animal is in the same species as the third animal. In this example, the set of all animals related to a particular ox forms an equivalence classâ€”it is the set of cattle. In fact, the set of all animals on this farm can be partitioned into different equivalence classes (in this case species). == Related pages == * Congruence * Equality (mathematics) == References == Category:Mathematics",
