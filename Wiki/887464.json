 "text": "The Honduras spikethumb frog (Plectrohyla dasypus) is a frog that lives in Honduras. It lives in pine-oak forests. Scientists have seen it between 1410 and 1990 meters above sea level in the Sierra de Omoa mountains. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 31.5 to 44.0 mm long from nose to rear end. Scientists can tell this frog apart from other frogs because it has spikes on its throat near its vocal slits. Its skin is bronze in color with black spots. ==Threats== This frog is critically endangered. This means it could die out. One of the reasons it is endangered is that the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis kills it. The fungus makes the tadpoles hatch with broken mouths. The frog is also endangered because human beings change the places it likes to live. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
