The patient may have difficulty moving his arms and legs, and slur their words. It occurs when dopamine is not correctly regulated by the body. It is usually a reaction to medicines, but is also caused by Parkinson's disease or a head injury. ==Other websites== *Ballism Category:Muscle diseases Category:Symptoms",
