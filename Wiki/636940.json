Taft and Representative Fred A. Hartley, Jr., and became law despite U.S. President Harry S. Truman's veto on June 23, 1947. Labor leaders called it the \"slave-labor bill\" while President Truman argued that it was a \"dangerous intrusion on free speech\", arguing that it would \"conflict with important principles of our democratic society\".Harry S.
