 "text": "Muzaffar al-Din Jahan Shah ibn Yusuf (died 1467) was the leader of the Kara Koyunlu Oghuz Turkoman tribal federation in Azerbaijan. He ruled from about 1438 to 1467. He grew the Kara Koyunlu’s land to its largest. It included Western Anatolia, most of present day Iraq, central Iran, and even Kerman. He was one of the greatest rulers of the Kara Koyunlu. He was said to enjoy drinking and entertainment. During his rule Jahan Shah had the Gökmedrese and Muzafferiye theological schools built in his capital city Tabriz. Azerbaijani was his mother tongue and he wrote poems in this language.V. Minorsky. Jihān- Shāh Qara-Qoyunlu and His Poetry (Turkmenica, 9). Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. — Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of School of Oriental and African Studies, 1954. — V.16, p . 272, 283: «It is somewhat astonishing that a sturdy Turkman like Jihan-shah should have been so restricted in his ways of expression. Altogether the language of the poems belongs to the group of the southern Turkman dialects which go by the name of Oghuz Turkish.»; «As yet nothing seems to have been published on the Br. Mus. manuscript Or. 9493, which contains the bilingual collection of poems of Haqiqi, i.e. of the Qara-qoyunlu sultan Jihan-shah (A.D. 1438—1467).» ==References== Category:1467 deaths Category:Azerbaijani people Category:Kings and queens Category:Year of birth unknown Category:15th-century Asian people",
