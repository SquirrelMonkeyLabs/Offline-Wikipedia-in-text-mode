 "text": "Denmark took part at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games, after the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A total of 113 athletes, 63 men and 50 women, competed in 17 sports, although two other athletes played as team reserves. Handball was the only sport in a team in which Denmark took part in these Olympic games. The Danish team included several past Olympic champions, one of them defending (the men's lightweight coxless fours team, led by veteran rowers Eskild Ebbesen and Morten Jørgensen). Notable athletes featured tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, and swimmer Lotte Friis, who won the bronze medal in Beijing. Kim Wraae Knudsen, silver medalist in the men's sprint kayak doubles in Beijing, was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Team Danmark and the Danish Sports' Union (Dansk Idræts-Forbund, DIF) set a goal of eight medals to be targeted in the medal standings. Team Danmark and DIF also believed Denmark had the best chances of winning a medal in wrestling, shooting, cycling, handball, the equestrian events, rowing, athletics, badminton and sailing. At the end of the Games, Denmark has reached beyond the medal target by a single point. Denmark left London with a total of 9 medals (2 gold, 4 silver, and 3 bronze), being considered its most successful Olympics after 64 years. One gold medal were won by rowers Rasmus Quist and Mads Rasmussen in the men's lightweight double sculls, and one gold medal won by track cyclist Lasse Norman Hansen in the first ever men's omnium. Other medals were awarded to the team in sailing, shooting, badminton, and women's rowing. Several Danish athletes, however, nearly missed out of the medal standings in their sporting events, including two from Greco-Roman wrestling. ==Medalists== | width=\"78%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | Medal Name Sport Event Date Mads Rasmussen Rowing Men's lightweight double sculls Cycling Men's omnium 5 August Shooting Men's skeet Rowing Women's single sculls Sailing Men's Finn Carsten Mogensen Badminton Men's doubles Kasper Winther Morten Jørgensen Jacob Barsøe Eskild Ebbesen Rowing Men's lightweight coxless four Christinna Pedersen Badminton Mixed doubles Allan Nørregaard Sailing 49er | width=\"22%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | Medals by sport Medals by sport Medals by sport Medals by sport Medals by sport Medals by sport Medals by sport Sport Total Rowing 1 1 1 3 Cycling 1 0 0 1 Badminton 0 1 1 2 Sailing 0 1 1 2 Shooting 0 1 0 1 Total 2 4 3 9 ==Competitors== | width=78% align=left valign=top | The following is the list of number of competitors participating in the Games: Sport Men Women Total Archery 0 3 3 Athletics 3 3 6 Badminton 6 4 10 Boxing 1 0 1 Canoeing 4 1 5 Cycling 10 1 11 Equestrian 0 4 4 Gymnastics 1 0 1 Handball 14 14 28 Rowing 7 3 10 Sailing 5 6 11 Shooting 3 2 5 Swimming 5 5 10 Table tennis 2 1 3 Tennis 0 1 1 Triathlon 0 2 2 Wrestling 2 0 2 Total 63 50 113 | width=22% align=left valign=top | Medals by date Medals by date Medals by date Medals by date Medals by date Medals by date Day Date Total Day 1 28 July 0 0 0 0 Day 2 29 July 0 0 0 0 Day 3 30 July 0 0 0 0 Day 4 31 July 0 1 0 1 Day 5 1 August 0 0 0 0 Day 6 2 August 0 0 1 1 Day 7 3 August 0 0 1 1 Day 8 4 August 1 1 0 2 Day 9 5 August 1 2 0 3 Day 10 6 August 0 0 0 0 Day 11 7 August 0 0 0 0 Day 12 8 August 0 0 1 1 Day 13 9 August 0 0 0 0 Day 14 10 August 0 0 0 0 Day 15 11 August 0 0 0 0 Day 16 12 August 0 0 0 0 Total Total 2 4 3 9 ==Archery== Three Danish individual quota places as well as a team quota place were secured at the 2011 World Archery Championships on 6 June 2011, as the Danish team, consisting of Carina Christiansen, Maja Jager and Louise Laursen, finished 8th in the women's recurve event.
