He is best known for creating the online series Spooky Month, and Mokey's Show, an absurd parody of Disney's Mickey Mouse. He has created various viral parodies of cartoons and video games such as Team Fortress 2, Super Mario, and Undertale, notable for their satire and black comedy. As of October 31, 2024, his channel has over 7.05 million subscribers and 1.6 billion total views. His YouTube channel was originally named \"123pendejos\" before changing to Sr Pelo, based on a nickname given to him by friends. One of his videos titled \"Every StoryTime Animation\", parodying the new-age wave of \"storytime animators\" in the mid-to-late 2010's, was seen by YouTube Let's Player Arin Hanson who deemed the video as â€œmean\" and \"harmful\". In 2020, Casanova's characters Skid and Pump, the two main protagonists of Spooky Month, were featured as guest characters in the indie rhythm game Friday Night Funkin', for their notable association with the website Newgrounds. == References == == Other websites == * Sr Pelo on Newgrounds * Sr Pelo on Twitter Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican voice actors Category:People from Veracruz Category:YouTubers Category:Animators",
