 "text": "Smallville is a fictional town appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in Superman stories. == Overview == It is an idyllic farming community located in the state of Kansas. It is historically known as the home of the Kent family and their adopted son Clark Kent, who is secretly Superman and in some realities was Superboy during his teen years. The town was first identified as Smallville, USA in Superboy #2 (1949). Initially, Smallville's exact location was not solidly identified, though it had been suggested that it was located somewhere in the Midwest. Some sources even placed it within a short distance of Metropolis and the outlying community of Midvale on the East Coast. With the 1986 reboot of Superman's continuity following the Crisis on Infinite Earths event, Smallville was firmly established as a town in the state of Kansas. == In other media == Since the 1978 appearance in Superman: The Movie, Smallville has been a setting in other non-comic book productions (film, television, video games and novels) featuring Superboy / Superman.
