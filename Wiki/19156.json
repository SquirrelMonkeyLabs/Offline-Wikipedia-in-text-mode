With over 41,000 square kilometers, it is one of the largest regions of mainland France (the largest of all French regions is French Guiana, in South America). Its capital was Bordeaux, the largest city. The French name of the people living in the region is Aquitain. The five departments in the region were Dordogne, Gironde, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne, and Pyrénées-Atlantiques. ==Geography== The Aquitaine region was the third largest region of Metropolitan France, after Midi-Pyrénées and Rhône-Alpes.

The Greenwich Meridian passes through Aquitaine. Most of Aquitaine is in the Aquitanian basin,A basin, or sedimentary basin, is a low place in the Earth that gets filled with dirt and rocks. a relatively flat and geologically young landscape.
