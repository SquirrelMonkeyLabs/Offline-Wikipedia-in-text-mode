 "text": "\"Boys Don't Cry\" is a 1979 song by English gothic rock band The Cure. It was released as a stand-alone single in the United Kingdom. It is taken from the band's 1980 album Boys Don't Cry. In 1986 the single went to number 19 in Germany, number 22 in the United Kingdom and number 26 in Australia. ==Music video== The video, released in 1986 to promote the \"New Voice New Mix\" re- recording, features three children, including actors Mark Heatley, Christian Andrews and Russell Ormes who were miming the song. Behind a curtain, Smith, Tolhurst and Dempsey (in his only appearance with the band since his 1979 departure), appear as the children's shadows, with red eyes. This effect was attained by painting their eyelids with fluorescent paint. == References == Category:1979 songs Category:The Cure songs Category:Jangle pop songs",
