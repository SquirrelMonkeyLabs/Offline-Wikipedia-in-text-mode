The battle was fought August 7–9, 1864 between what are now Medora and Sentinel Butte, North Dakota. == Results == Alfred Sully estimated around 100 Native American warriors were killed in battle, this may have been an exaggeration due to range. Only 3 US soldiers were killed in the battle, along with an additional 10 wounded. == References == Badlands Badlands Category:Battles of Alfred Sully’s expeditions",
