 "text": "Fall to Grace is a studio album. It is the second one by British singer- songwriter Paloma Faith. It was released on 28 May 2012. She worked on the album with producer Nellee Hooper, who previously worked with artists such as Björk, Massive Attack, and Gwen Stefani. Faith has said \"The new album has taken on a very cinematic mood. I am very excited to introduce my new sound into the world. Working with Nellee Hooper (Björk, Madonna) has been really inspirational.\" Likewise, Hooper said that working with Faith reminded him of his work with Björk, saying \"At lunch [Paloma Faith] sat and talked in such detail, as if every song was a short film, referencing everything from Chinese romantic cinema to Hip Hop.\" The album's lead single is \"Picking Up the Pieces\". It was released on 20 May 2012. Faith described it as \"...the issues of being in a relationship with someone who is still recovering from a previous relationship with another person. It is a song about self-doubt and insecurity.\" ==Track listing== ===Notes=== * signifies a co-producer ==References== Category:2012 albums Category:Paloma Faith albums",
