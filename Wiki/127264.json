 "text": "A word processor is a computer program (often a text editor) or a special computer intended to edit texts with colours and different font sizes and styles, or texts which will be printed. Most such programs now have helpful instruments (tools) to make good texts. Important instruments include spelling & grammar checker, word count (this also counts letters and lines). Moreover, with such programs one can make attractive documents, add pictures into documents, make webpages, graphs etc. Also, they show synonyms (similar words) of words and some can read the text aloud. Many word processors, similar to many new programs, have configurable printing facilities. Some of the more versatile ones are called Desktop publishing programs. Examples include: * Microsoft Word, one of the few commonly sold in shops * LibreOffice Writer * iWork Pages for macOS * TextEdit for macOS * WordPad is among the simplest and most widespread * OpenOffice Writer, usually downloaded with OpenOffice *",
