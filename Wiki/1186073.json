The EP peaked at number four on the Scottish Albums Chart. ==Background== One of the songs from the EP, \"Your Anthem\" was written by Bowie when he was 15 years old, talking about the song he said, \"It's about growing up in a small town with nothing much to do. Bar being with your mates! When me and my friends would get together, we'd just drive around blasting music. Music was our escape. It saves you. There were times when I wanted to escape. But now I always want to be back! Itâ€™s such a tear-up.\" Talking about the EP, he said, \"Mostly, I write from experience. The EP is really personal. It's me. It's my life. This is everything I've experienced. I've had lots of ups and downs, not in music, but just in personal life and lots of hard moments, and those stories are the thread that ties it all together.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (2025) Peak position Scottish Albums (OCC) 4 ==Release history== Regions Date Format(s) Label Various 21 March 2025 Digital download Capitol Records ==References== Category:2025 albums",
