Therefore, a group of amateurs had the idea to build a Plaza de Toros, so that Mérida had a taurine calendar and was added to the most important fairs of the country, which already had a peak imponente in all the national territories. At the beginning the fairs, who was set up the first days of December, had the function of celebrate the day of the \"Immaculate Conception\", therefore the people set the date of the fairs on 9 December and 10 December. For the bullfighting, César Faraco, Manuel Benítez \"El Cordobés\", Francisco Rivera \"Paquirri\", Julio Aparicio, Curro Girón, Paco Camino and the mounted bullfighter, Juan Cañedo, who is of Mexican origin, and fought bulls of Félix Rodríguez, \"Achury Vejo\" and \"Ambaló\" who all originated in the country of Colombia. For the first run, heavy rainfall prevented the inauguration, which resulted in two runs, which had to be held on the second day: one in the morning hours and the other during the afternoon, which was, the first time this had happened in a same square, in the same day in Venezuela. Previously in Caracas, which celebrated two runs in the same day, but in two different squares, in the \"Circo Metropolitano\" and the \"Nuevo Circo\", but in the same square, during the same day, which also, was the first time that this had happened.
