It is named after Ebba Ramsay's youth friend Cecilia Willerding. The church was opened in 1903 by Diocese of Växjö bishop Herman Lindström. It later came under supervision by the Vicar of Jönköping. It was renovated in 1963. It later came under the Jönköping County Council. It was then transferred to municipal public housing in Vätterhem. Vätterhem would often rent it out for worship services, including weddings.
