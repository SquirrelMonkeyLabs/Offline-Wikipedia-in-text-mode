 "text": "The Fungus epidemic in India has spread in the center area of India. More than 50,000 people have gotten sick because of the mucormycosis disease. Because of the increase in cases of the second wave of COVID-19, some areas had more diseases. The WHO has warned that the fungal disease is spreading, especially during the third wave of COVID-19 in India. Mucormycosis has spread in many areas of India such as: New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashta, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. ==Causes== The epidemic is caused by a kind of mucormycosis fungus with zygomycosis. If it goes into the human brain, it causes blindness. If it gets into other parts of the body, it can cause redness and inflammation, nose allergies, bleeding and vomiting, rare cough with blood in the spit, and shortness of breath. ===Variants=== The fungus is a type of fungal disease that attacks the inside organs of a person. It often attacks diabetics, people with weak immunity, and people with high blood pressure. The fungus also attacks those who have recovered from COVID-19 or COVID-19 patients. Fungal infections can come from unhygienic (not clean) places, people, situations, and things. Three noteworthy types: # White Fungus: This type has white patches that can show on the mouth, throat, and other inside organs. It is often seen with candidiasis, which can be more severe in immunocompromised patients. # Black Fungus: Known by doctors as mucormycosis, this severe infection mostly attacks people with diabetes or those who have undergone big health challenges. It can lead to serious difficulties and health issues. # Yellow Fungus: This type is not talked about as much but can also be dangerous. It usually is a more systemic infection that may attack different organs and needs quick medical care. ==Affected countries== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== Category:21st-century epidemics Category:2021 in India Category:2021 disasters in Asia Category:2020s disasters in India",
