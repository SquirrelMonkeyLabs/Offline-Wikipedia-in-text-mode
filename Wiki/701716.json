 "text": "The Civil Works Administration (CWA) was a program that created jobs. It did not last long. It was created by the New Deal during the Great Depression. The jobs were manual-labor jobs for millions of unemployed workers. The jobs were temporary, meaning the workers didn't work for a very long time. This lasted during winter of 1933â€“34. President Franklin D. Roosevelt told everyone about the CWA on November 8, 1933, and put Harry L. Hopkins in charge of it. The CWA was a project created from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). The CWA created construction jobs, mainly making new buildings and bridges (or making them better). It ended on March 31, 1934. $200 million per month was spent. It gave jobs to four million people. Category:New Deal Category:Great Depression Category:Franklin D.
