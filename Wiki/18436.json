 "text": "A unicorn is a legendary and mythical creature. It looks like a pony with one long, single white horn on its head. In some pictures unicorns also have horses' feet or a lion's tail. In most myths, a unicorn's blood and horn have mystical powers. The word unicorn means \"one-horned\". It comes from the Latin word ūnus, which means one, and cornu which means horn, which term is in itself borrowed from the earlier Greek word monokerōs (also 'one horned'). The term \"unicorn\" is also used in business to refer to a business startup valued at a billion dollars or more. == Around the world == Unicorns are found in many stories and myths from around the world, especially China and India. In On the Nature of Animals (Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος, De natura animalium), Aelian, quoting Ctesias, says that India has a one-horned horse (iii. 41; iv. 52). He writes (xvi. 20) that the monoceros () was sometimes called cartazonos (), which may be a kind of the Arabic word karkadann, meaning \"rhinoceros\". In mythology and heraldry, the unicorn symbolizes innocence, purity and feminine power. It is often seen as the counterpart of the lion, which symbolizes the masculine virtues. In Western culture, a unicorn's horn is said to have power to heal wounds and sickness, and to neutralize poison. This power was often called alicorn in medieval times, when stories of unicorns became more popular. People purchased expensive \"unicorn horns\" that were usually Narwhal horns or walrus tusks. Christian legends say the unicorn is as small as a normal-sized goat. According to these legends, unicorns are so fearful that no hunter can catch them; only a maiden that goes into the forest alone can catch a unicorn. The unicorn will come and fall asleep in the maiden’s lap. The unicorn is the official animal of Scotland. == Real animals == File:Нарвал в российской Арктике.jpg|Male narwhal (Arctic Ocean) File:Walrus.jpg|Walruses with tusks (Arctic Ocean) File:World famous.jpg|Indian rhinoceros (Indian subcontinent) File:Greater One Horned Rhino 8.6.2012 Whytheymatter HI 203197.jpg|Indian rhinoceros (Indian subcontinent) File:Rhino in Solio Reserve.jpg|White rhinoceros (Sub-Saharan Africa) File:Scimitar-horned Oryx - July 1, 2008.jpg|Scimitar oryxes (North Africa) File:Oryx dammah -Marwell Wildlife, Hampshire, England-8a (one horned scimitar oryx).jpg|Scimitar oryx with one horn File:Oryx gazella (Gemsbok).jpg|Gemsbok (Sub-Saharan Africa) ==References== ==Sources== * Lindahl, Carl. \"Unicorn.\" World Book Advanced.
