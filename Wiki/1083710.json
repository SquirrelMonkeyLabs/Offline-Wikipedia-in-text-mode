India - West Retrieved from ProQuest Diversity Collection. VocaliD is a company that customizes digital voices for people with speech impairments. She collects the limited sounds that her patients are able to make, and matches them with a donated voice from their “Voice Bank”. This way, people with speech impairments can have computerized voices that match their identities. For example, a young girl's voice will not sound like an adult man. She began research in 2007 and later founded VocaliD in 2014. She has also received grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. She gave a TED talk about her work in 2013. It convinced 1,500 people to sign up to donate their voice. She has a masters, bachelor's degree, and a doctorate in psychology, speech acoustics, and speech-language pathology. Patel was on the faculty in the department of bio-behavioral sciences at the Teachers College of Columbia University in 2003. == References == Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:Canadian educators Category:Living people Category:Pathologists Category:Researchers Category:University of Calgary alumni Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024",
