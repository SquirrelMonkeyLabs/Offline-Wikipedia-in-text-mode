 "text": "The UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements describes the wheel arrangement of locomotives, multiple units and trams. It is set out in the International Union of Railways (UIC) \"Leaflet 650 - Standard designation of axle arrangement on locomotives and multiple-unit sets\". It is used in much of the world. The United Kingdom used a related scheme. The United States uses the simplified AAR wheel arrangement for modern locomotives. ==Examples== * Bo'Bo' (UK Bo-Bo) Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has two powered axles individually driven by traction motors * Co'Co' (UK Co- Co) Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has three powered axles individually driven by traction motors * Co'Bo' (UK Co-Bo) Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. One bogie has three powered axles and the other bogie has two powered axles. All axles are individually driven by traction motors ==References== Category:Locomotive classification systems de:Bauartbezeichnung von Triebfahrzeugen#VDEV/VMEV/UIC-System",
