Her Parents were George Thomas Campbell and Phyllis \"Lisa\" Cook. She entered the PC Party leadership race after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced his retirement from politics. She defeated Jean Charest at the Progressive Conservative leadership convention and was appointed Prime Minister on June 25, 1993 by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn. She served as Prime Minister from June 25, 1993 to November 4, 1993. She was the first and only to date female Prime Minister of Canada, the first Prime Minister to have been born in British Columbia and the first Prime Minister to be a baby boomer. When Campbell became Prime Minister, there had to be a general election. This is because elections in Canada have to take place at least every five years. During the 1993 federal election campaign, she became very unpopular after the writ was dropped. Because of this, on the day of the election, the Progressive Conservatives won only two seats in Parliament. Campbell lost her own seat.McLaughlin, David.
