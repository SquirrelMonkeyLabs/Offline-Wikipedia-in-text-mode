He responded by invading the Karakhanid dominions, taking Bukhara and besieging Samarkand, where Chaghrï Khan had taken refuge. The latter appealed to both the Turks of the Syr Darya and the Qara Khitai, and the gurkhan sent an army, but its commander hesitated to enter into conflict with the Khwarazmis. In the end a peace was mediated where Chaghrï Khan was forced to take back the Qarluk leaders and restore them to their former positions.https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/il-arslan/ Encyclopædia Iranica, online edition, Vol. XII, Fasc. 6. New York. pp. 643–644. ===Second invasion=== The Khwarezm-Shah took Bukhara in 1207, but was defeated by the Qara Khitai at Samarkand.

Muhammad, in retaliation, sacked the city and executed 10,000 citizens of Samarkand.Rafis Abazov, Palgrave Concise Historical Atlas of Central Asia, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008), 43. In August-September 1210, a very fierce battle took place between the Khwarezm Shahs and the Kara-Khitans in the Ilamish plains near Andijan.
