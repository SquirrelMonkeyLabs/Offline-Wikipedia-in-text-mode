 "text": "Sound the Alarm is the fifth studio album by the emo band Saves the Day. It was released by Vagrant Records on April 11, 2006. It was produced by Steve Evetts who also produced Saves the Day's first two albums, Can't Slow Down and Through Being Cool. All of the album's lyrics were written by Chris Conley. It is their darkest album, and Chris wrote it about the black clouds in his life, and things that were eating him alive. This album was welcomed by many as something of a return to the band's classic sound, after the sonic departure of In Reverie in 2003. Sound the Alarm reached number 67 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart. Sound the Alarm is part one of a three part concept that Conley described in an interview with Punknews.org. It is their trilogy about self discovery. The \"Head for the Hills\" track is used on the soundtrack of the football video game Madden NFL 07. ==Track listing== #\"Head for the Hills\" - 2:50 #\"The End\" - 1:54 #\"Shattered\" - 3:08 #\"Eulogy\" - 3:22 #\"Dying Day\" - 2:21 #\"34\" - 2:22 #\"Say You'll Never Leave\" - 2:20 #\"Diseased\" - 2:12 #\"Don't Know Why\" - 3:22 #\"Sound the Alarm\" - 3:06 #\"Bones\" 2:23 #\"Delusional\" 2:07 #\"Hell Is Here\" 3:36 ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Concept albums",
