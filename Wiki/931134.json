 "text": "A T20I is an international cricket match between two teams that have official Twenty20 International status. This is determined by the International Cricket Council. It is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket and is the shortest form of the game. Afghanistan played its first T20I match on 1 February 2010, against Ireland, losing the match by 5 wickets. Their first win came three days later in their second T20I match, which was against Canada, with Afghanistan winning by 5 wickets with one ball remaining. This list includes all members of the Afghanistan cricket team who have played at least one T20I match. It is arranged in the order in which each player won his first Twenty20 cap.
