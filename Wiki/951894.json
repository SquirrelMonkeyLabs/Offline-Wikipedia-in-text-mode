 "text": "The Prince of Denmark's March was written by Jeremiah Clarke. It is also called Trumpet Voluntary. It was first published as a harpsichord piece in A Choice Collection of Ayres for the Harpsichord in 1700. It may have been dedicated to Prince George of Denmark and Anne of Great Britain's marriage. It was arranged by Sir Henry Wood for orchestra. He mistakenly thought that Henry Purcell had written the piece. It is often performed in weddings and other ceremonies. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:Compositions",
