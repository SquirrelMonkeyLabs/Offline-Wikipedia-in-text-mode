 "text": "The Minister for Foreign Affairs (外務大臣, Gaimu Daijin) of Japan is the Cabinet member responsible for Japanese foreign policy and the chief executive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the end of the allied occupation of Japan, the position has been one of the most powerful in the Cabinet, as Japan's economic interests have long relied on external relations. The recent efforts of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to establish a more interventionistforeign policy have also heightened the importance of the position. The position is currently held by Takeshi Iwaya. == List of ministers for foreign affairs== *Italics indicates subject served as Acting Foreign Minister. *Bold indicates subject served concurrently as Prime Minister for a period of time. === Empire of Japan (1885–1945) === #
