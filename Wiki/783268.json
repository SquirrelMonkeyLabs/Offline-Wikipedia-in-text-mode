By the end of July 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was not able to carry major operations and an Allied invasion of Japan was near. Together with the British Empire and China, the United States called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945. A key factor in Japan's surrender were the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. – Article ID 2501 – PDF ==References== Category:World War II Category:1945 in Japan",
