 "text": "The Chitrali people, also known as Chitralis, are an ethnic group in Pakistan, living mainly around the Chitral District. They speak the Khowar language. Their main religion is Sunni Islam. The Kho are excellent mountaineers who seemingly do not get tired or cold when working all day. ==Culture== Chitrali culture places heavy emphasis on poetry, song and dance. Chitrali people also have a great respect of law and order. Much of this can be attributed to Chitral being a stable kingdom for most of its history, where the rule of law and the will of the ruler came before tribal concepts such as revenge and isolationism. Polo is a popular sport and pastime for the Kho people. Polo traditionally played by the Kho has little rules or organisation. Dance and music play a large role in Kho society. Common clothing include the salwar kameez (long tunic and trousers) and headwear includes the pakol (chitrali hat). The song of Nano Begal is a famous folk song from Chitral. ==Language== These people speak Chitrali language which is an Indo-Aryan language of the Dardic subgroup. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Afghanistan Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan Category:Chitral District",
