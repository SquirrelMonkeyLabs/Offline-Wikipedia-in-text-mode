 "text": "Fermat's little theorem is a theorem from number theory. It is named after Pierre de Fermat who found it in the 17th century. It is about the properties of primes. It says that if a is a number, and p is a prime number, then in the notation of modular Arithmetic, it can be expressed as, :a^p \\equiv a\\,(\\mathrm{mod}\\,p), If a is not a multiple of p, then the following is often used: :a^{p-1} \\equiv 1\\,(\\mathrm{mod}\\,p) Category:Theorems in number theory",
