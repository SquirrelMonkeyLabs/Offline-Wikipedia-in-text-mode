 "text": "In the sport of cricket, all eleven players on the fielding side take the field together. One of them is the wicket-keeper, a specialist who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batter on strike. Besides the bowler and the wicket-keeper, the other nine fielders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen positions around the field, except as stipulated in Law 28.5 that they are not allowed to stand on the pitch. The fielding positions are not fixed but they are known by specific and sometimes colourful names such as third man, silly mid on, and long leg. The captain determines all the tactics including who should bowl (and how); and is responsible for setting the field, though usually in consultation with the bowler. The fielding team is allowed substitutes in case of injury or other valid reasons for a player's absence, subject to Law 24 which stipulates that a substitute is not allowed for a fielder who leaves for other than \"a wholly acceptable reason\". == References == Category:Cricket Category:Sports words",
