 "text": "The splake or slake (Salvelinus namaeycush X Salvelinus fontinalis) is a fish. It is the hybrid of a male brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and a female lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). The name is a combination of speckled trout (another name for brook trout) and lake trout. The name may have been used as early as the 1880s.Kerr, S. J. (2000): F1 Splake: An Annotated Bibliography and Literature Review. Fish and Wildlife Branch, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Peterborough, Ontario. 79p. + appendices. Hybrids of the male lake trout with the female brook trout (the so-called \"brookinaw\") have also been produced, but are not as successful.Sowards, C. L. 1959.
