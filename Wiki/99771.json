 "text": "The Rose Bowl Game is an American college football bowl game at the Rose Bowl (stadium) in Pasadena, California. It is known as the \"granddaddy of them all\" because it has been played every year since 1916. It is almost always played on January 1 after Pasadena's Rose Parade. For many years, the two teams who played were the winner of the Pac-10 (a football conference of colleges on the West Coast) and the winner of the Big 10 (a football conference of colleges in the Midwest). In 1998, the game became part of the Bowl Championship Series. USC has won the game 24 times. ==Results== Date Played Winning Team Losing Team Notes January 1, 1902 Michigan 49 Stanford 0 notes January 1, 1916 Washington State 14 Brown 0 notes January 1, 1917 Oregon 14 Pennsylvania 0 notes January 1, 1918 Mare Island - USMC 19 Camp Lewis - US Army 7 notes January 1, 1919 Great Lakes - US Navy 17 Mare Island 0 notes January 1, 1920 Harvard 7 Oregon 6 notes January 1, 1921 California 28 Ohio State 0 notes January 2, 1922 0 0 notes January 1, 1923 14 Penn State 3 notes January 1, 1924 14 14 notes January 1, 1925 27 10 notes January 1, 1926 Alabama 20 19 notes January 1, 1927 Alabama 7 Stanford 7 notes January 2, 1928 7 6 notes January 1, 1929 8 7 notes January 1, 1930 47 14 notes January 1, 1931 Alabama 24 0 notes January 1, 1932 21 12 notes January 2, 1933 35 0 notes January 1, 1934 7 0 notes January 1, 1935 Alabama 29 13 notes January 1, 1936 7 0 notes January 1, 1937 Pittsburgh 21 0 notes January 1, 1938 California 13 Alabama 0 notes January 2, 1939 7 3 notes January 1, 1940 14 Tennessee 0 notes January 1, 1941 Stanford 21 Nebraska 13 notes January 1, 1942** Oregon State 20 16 notes January 1, 1943 Georgia 9 0 notes January 1, 1944 29 0 notes January 1, 1945 25 0 notes January 1, 1946 Alabama 34 14 notes January 1, 1947 45 14 notes January 1, 1948 Michigan 49 0 notes January 1, 1949 Northwestern 20 14 notes January 2, 1950 Ohio State 17 14 notes January 1, 1951 Michigan 14 6 notes January 1, 1952 40 7 notes January 1, 1953 7 Wisconsin 0 notes January 1, 1954 28 20 notes January 1, 1955 Ohio State 20 7 notes January 2, 1956 17 14 notes January 1, 1957 Iowa 35 Oregon State 19 notes January 1, 1958 Ohio State 10 7 notes January 1, 1959 Iowa 38 12 notes January 1, 1960 44 8 notes January 2, 1961 17 Minnesota 7 notes January 1, 1962 Minnesota 21 3 notes January 1, 1963 42 37 notes January 1, 1964 17 7 notes January 1, 1965 Michigan 34 Oregon State 7 notes January 1, 1966 14 Michigan State 12 notes January 2, 1967 Purdue 14 13 notes January 1, 1968 Southern California 14 Indiana 3 notes January 1, 1969 Ohio State 27 Southern California 16 notes January 1, 1970 10 Michigan 3 notes January 1, 1971 Stanford 27 Ohio State 17 notes January 1, 1972 13 Michigan 12 notes January 1, 1973 42 Ohio State 17 notes January 1, 1974 Ohio State 42 21 notes January 1, 1975 18 Ohio State 17 notes January 1, 1976 UCLA 23 Ohio State 10 notes January 1, 1977 14 Michigan 6 notes January 2, 1978 Washington 27 Michigan 20 notes January 1, 1979 Southern California 17 Michigan 10 notes January 1, 1980 Southern California 17 Ohio State 16 notes January 1, 1981 Michigan 23 6 notes January 1, 1982 28 Iowa 0 notes January 1, 1983 UCLA 24 Michigan 14 notes January 2, 1984 UCLA 45 9 notes January 1, 1985 Southern California 20 Ohio State 17 notes January 1, 1986 UCLA 45 Iowa 28 notes January 1, 1987 22 Michigan 15 notes January 1, 1988 Michigan State 20 Southern California 17 notes January 2, 1989 Michigan 22 Southern California 14 notes January 1, 1990 Southern California 17 Michigan 10 notes January 1, 1991 Washington 46 Iowa 34 notes January 1, 1992 Washington 34 Michigan 14 notes January 1, 1993 Michigan 38 31 notes January 1, 1994 21 16 notes January 2, 1995 Penn State 38 Oregon 20 notes January 1, 1996 Southern California 41 Northwestern 32 notes January 1, 1997 Ohio State 20 Arizona State 17 notes January 1, 1998 Michigan 21 Washington State 16 notes January 1, 1999 Wisconsin 38 31 notes January 1, 2000 Wisconsin 17 9 notes January 1, 2001 Washington 34 Purdue 24 notes January 3, 2002* Miami (FL) 37 Nebraska 14 notes January 1, 2003 Oklahoma 34 Washington State 14 notes January 1, 2004 Southern California 28 Michigan 14 notes January 1, 2005 Texas 38 Michigan 37 notes January 4, 2006* Texas 41 Southern California 38 notes January 1, 2007 Southern California 32 Michigan 18 notes January 1, 2008 Southern California 49 Illinois 17 notes January 1, 2009 Southern California 38 Penn State 24 January 1, 2010 Ohio State 26 Oregon 17 January 1, 2011 TCU 21 Wisconsin 19 January 2, 2012 Oregon 45 Wisconsin 38 January 1, 2013 Stanford 20 Wisconsin 14 * denotes BCS National Championship Game ** Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 1942 game was moved to Duke University's Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham, North Carolina, as officials were wary of allowing such a large crowd to congregate anywhere on the West Coast due to World War II security concerns. ==Related pages== *Fiesta Bowl *Sugar Bowl *Orange Bowl *BCS National Championship Game Category:College football Category:Pasadena, California Category:1902 establishments in the United States Category:1900s establishments in California Category:January events",
