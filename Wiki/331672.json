The fetishist has an interest in foot shapes (such as foot arches or foot sizes), toe sizes, smell or foot wear (such as shoes, bracelets, or socks). The foot fetish is the most common fetish that is not the genitals. The fetish is most common for males, although females may also have this fetish. A footjob is using feet to rub the penis (or sometimes the vagina or breasts) in a sexual way. It is a type of masturbation done with two people. ==References== Category:Sexual fetishism",
