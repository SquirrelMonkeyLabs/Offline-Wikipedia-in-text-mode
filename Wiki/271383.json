 "text": "House arrest is when someone has been arrested, but not put in prison. Instead, they are made to stay in their homes, hence the term. A notable example of house arrest is Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma. She was under house arrest for much of the time between 1990 and 2010. Subjects typically wear ankle bracelets which alert the authorities when they leave their house. ==References== Category:Punishments Category:Imprisonment and detention",
