 "text": "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems is a paper published by Claude Shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory. It is one of the foundational treatments (primitives) of modern cryptography. It is also a proof that all theoretically unbreakable (un-crack-able) ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad encryption algorithm. Shannon published an earlier version of this research in the classified report A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography, Memorandum MM 45-110-02, Sept. 1, 1945, Bell Laboratories. In 1948, Shannon published his great paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" which is considered one of the founding works of the field of information theory. ==Related pages== * Confusion and diffusion * Product cipher ==References== * Shannon, Claude. \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\", Bell System Technical Journal, vol.28(4), page 656â€“715, 1949. ==Other websites== * Online retyped copy of the paper * Scanned version of the published BSTJ paper Category:Cryptography",
