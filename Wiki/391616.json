 "text": "The Harrowing of Hell, in Christianity, is when Christ went down to Hell after his death on Good Friday, and helped many souls escape. It is mentioned in 1 Peter 3:18-22. It was a story used in the first of the English religious dramas written during the Middle Ages. The Bible does not say for sure if Christ really went to Hell or not. People understand this differently. ==References== Category:Jesus Category:Christian theology",
