He became the national president of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria on 7 February 2005. He held the position for five years.In July 2010, Oritsejafor was elected president of the Christian Association of Nigeria, the umbrella body of all Christians in the country. He was the first Pentecostal leader to hold the position. Oritsejafor was the first to launch a Miracle crusade from Africa to a world audience through satellite in 1987 with evangelist Joe Martins. ==Early life== Ayo Oritsejafor was born on November 10 into the family of Mr. Joseph Monday Oritsejafor and Mrs. Roli Durojaiye Oritsejafor in Lagos, Nigeria. His mother is a committed member of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC). In 1972, Oritsejafor became \"born again\" in an evangelical crusade held in Sapele, Nigeria. Oritsejafor enrolled at the All Nations For Christ Bible Institute, Benin City, Nigeria. He later joined the Nigerian Baptist Seminary, Ogbomosho in Oyo State, Nigeria. In 1979 he went to the United States for further studies at Morris Cerullo's School of Ministry (El Cortez), San Diego, California. According to him, he had a vision of himself wearing a suit and was preaching to thousands of people. He heard a voice that said to him, \"This is what you are going to be doing the rest of your life\" and the voice said, \"Take my word to the world\". This led to the founding of the Word of Life Bible Church in November 1987. He hosts Hour of Deliverance, a television program which had its debut in 1980. Oritsejafor says he owes all his life's accomplishments to God. His success in ministry he attributes to the influence of God-given mentors like Archbishop Benson Idahosa, Dr. Moris Cerullo, Evangelist Robert W. Schamback, and Evangelist Tommy L. Osborn among others. Oritsejafor is a promoter of leadership by example. This is evident in the role he played in bringing the crisis in Niger Delta area of Nigeria to an end. ==Philanthropy== Oritsejafor sees himself as a servant of God and an instrument through which God ministers to the spiritual and physical needs of people. He places emphasis on salvation, repentance, holiness, deliverance and empowerment of the less privileged, through social responsibility programmes. Over the years, he has condemned wastefulness and encouraged giving back to the society, regardless of religion or race. He offers scholarships to students in need in various tertiary, secondary and elementary institutions both within and outside Nigeria irrespective of tribe or denomination. In December 2005, Oritsejafor and his wife Helen partnered with Flight Micro Finance Bank to start an empowerment programme for the people. Oritsejafor, ever since, makes it a tradition to empower the less privileged and to reduce the sufferings of families all over at the end of every December. On 26 December 2016, the Word of Life Bible Church in conjunction with the Eagle Flight Micro Finance Bank held a poverty alleviation programme in Warri. On 23 May 2020, Oritsejafor and his wife Helen gave out some food items to the people \"in order to cushion the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the masses\". ==African Broadcasting Network== Oritsejafor set up African Broadcasting Network, an international satellite Christian television station intended to serve as a voice for the gospel of Christ from Africa to the world. It is a satellite channel broadcasting from London. It is currently viewed in 75 countries world-wide and online through WebTV. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Nigerian writers Category:Nigerian Christian clergy Category:People from Delta State Category:Preachers from Warri",
