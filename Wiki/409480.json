 "text": "The Government of Japan is a constitutional monarchy, like the United Kingdom. The head of state is the Emperor of Japan, Emperor Naruhito, while most executive power rests with the Prime Minister of Japan, currently (2022) Fumio Kishida, and his Cabinet. The Diet of Japan is the legislative branch or Parliament, made up of two houses. The upper house, the House of Councillors, is the subject of a national election every three years; the last election was in July 2022, when half of the seats for six year terms were voted on. ==Other websites== * Japanese Consulate-General in San Francisco- FAQ *Asahi website on the Upper House election",
