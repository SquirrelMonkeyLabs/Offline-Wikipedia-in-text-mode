The website is free to access, and uses advertising as a source of income. The website is an aggregator, it works similar to Youtube for videos. Video clips from professional videos are mixed with amateur and other types of content. By 2012, XVideos was the largest porn website in the world, with over 100 billion page views per month. Fabian Thylmann, the owner of MindGeek, attempted to purchase XVideos in 2012 in order to create a monopoly of pornographic tube sites. The French owner of XVideos turned down a reported offer of more than US$120 million by saying, \"Sorry, I have to go and play Diablo II.\" In 2014, XVideos controversially attempted to force content providers to either pledge to renounce the right to delete videos from their accounts or to shut down their accounts immediately. == References == Category:Pornographic websites Category:Czech websites",
