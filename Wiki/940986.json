 "text": "Verizon New England, Inc. is a Bell Operating Company that serves most of Massachusetts and all of Rhode Island. It was formerly New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, more commonly known as New England Telephone, which for seven decades served most of the New England area of the United States as a part of the original AT&T.; New England Telephone's coverage area included Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont as well as Massachusetts and Rhode Island, but Verizon sold off service in the northern three states, which as of 2020 are served by Consolidated Communications. After the Bell System divestiture, New England Telephone merged with New York Telephone to form NYNEX in 1984. NYNEX was acquired by Bell Atlantic in 1997. In 2000, Bell Atlantic bought GTE and changed its own name to Verizon. New England Telephone was then renamed Verizon New England. == References == Category:American telephone companies",
