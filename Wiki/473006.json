A Dirty Shame was released with an NC-17 rating by the MPAA. New Line Cinema was the distributor. It received mixed reviews. ==Plot== The people of Harford Road (Maryland Route #147) are divided into two camps: puritanical people who hate anything even remotely sexual. There are also the perverts, a group of sexual addicts whose sexual fetishes have been brought to the fore. A held back Sylvia Stickles finds herself as a puritan. One day, she leaves her promiscuous daughter Caprice locked up over the garage and under house arrest. Sylvia is smacked on the head by a passing car. She meets Ray- Ray Perkins, a local mechanic. Through a series of bizarre head knockings, everyone in the Harford Area of Baltimore becomes a sex addict. Ray-Ray shoots semen from his head. He becomes the messiah of \"Let's Go Sexin'\". ==Cast== * Tracey Ullman as Sylvia Stickles * Johnny Knoxville as Ray-Ray Perkins * Selma Blair as Caprice Stickles/\"Ursula Udders\" * Chris Isaak as Vaughn Stickles * Suzanne Shepherd as Big Ethel * Mink Stole as Marge The Neuter * Patricia Hearst as Paige * Jackie Hoffman as Dora * Wes Johnson as Fat Fuck Frank * Paul DeBoy as Wendell Doggett * Gaelan Alexander Connell as Horny kid * Channing Wilroy as Male motorist * Rosemary Knower as Female motorist * Alan J.

According to Waters, when he asked MPAA what he would have needed to cut from the movie before he could have it rated R, they said \"after a while, we just stopped taking notes.\" It was simply released into theaters with an NC-17 rating. It was shot entirely on location in Baltimore on the Harford Road. ==Reception== A Dirty Shame got mixed reviews from critics. Some liked or loved its unashamed vulgarity. Others, though, went against it for the same reason. On the Rotten Tomatoes, the approval rating is 53%, based on the reviews of 117 critics. On the Metacritic, the review for the movie is 56 out of 100, which means \"mixed or average\". ==References== Category:2004 comedy movies Category:2000s sex comedy movies Category:2004 LGBT movies Category:English-language movies Category:2000s satirical movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:American sex comedy movies Category:American satirical movies Category:Movies set in Baltimore Category:Movies set in Maryland Category:Movies directed by John Waters",
