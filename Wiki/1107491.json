The musical is set in Liverpool of the 1960s and 1970s. It won a number of awards. == Plot == Mrs. Johnstone is very poor, and already has seven children. When she is going to have twins, she decides to give one of the twins to her employer, Mrs. Lyons. Mrs. Lyons is infertile, and can't have children. Mrs. Lyons is very superstitious. Mrs Lyons tells Mrs Johnstone that if she tells the child of his brother, both children will die. Both sons, Edward and Mickey grow up in completely different environments, and don't know from each other's existence. One day, they meet, and decide to become blood brothers as they have the same birthday. A lot of the musical is about showing the different social environments they grow up in. They fall in love with the same girl, Linda. They are also envious of each other. In the end, Mickey (\"the poor one\") decides to kill Edward. So he enters the city council, with a gun. Mrs. Johnstone tells both that they are twins. Mickey shoots Edward, and is then shot by the police. Category:Plays by Willy Russell",
