 "text": "#1's is Mariah Carey's sixth VHS/DVD release. A collection of the music videos of her U.S. number-one singles (songs that reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100) up to that time, the home video was originally released on VHS in December 7, 1999, while the DVD was released in February 1, 2000. A year before this, Carey had released a greatest hits compilation, #1's, which included her thirteen U.S. number-one singles up to that point. The DVD of the same name is based on that album, but by the time of its release, Carey had already scored a fourteenth U.S. number one, \"Heartbreaker\", from her latest studio release Rainbow. Its music video and the video of its remix (as a bonus track) were thus included on the DVD. During the month of the DVD's release, Carey had also earned her fifteenth number one single, \"Thank God I Found You\". The DVD does not include the official music videos for \"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", and \"Someday\". They are replaced by live performances culled from previous DVD/video releases. #1's was re-released in 2008 as part of Mariah Carey: DVD Collection, a 2DVD set including also Fantasy: Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden. The video features a shortened version from the original, without the introductory sections per track. ==Track listing== #Program Start #\"Heartbreaker\" (featuring Jay-Z) #\"My All\" #\"Honey\" #\"Always Be My Baby\" #\"One Sweet Day\" (with Boyz II Men) #\"Fantasy\" (featuring O.D.B.) #\"Hero\"2 #\"Dreamlover\" #\"I'll Be There\" (featuring Trey Lorenz)1 #\"Emotions\" #\"I Don't Wanna Cry\" #\"Someday\"1 #\"Love Takes Time\"2 #\"Vision of Love\"3 #End Credits #DVD Bonus: \"Heartbreaker\" (Remix) (featuring Da Brat and Missy Elliott) 1taken from the Columbia Music Video release MTV Unplugged +3 2taken from the Columbia Music Video release Here Is Mariah Carey 3edited version taken from the Columbia Music Video release Fantasy: Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden ==Chart performance== Chart Peak position Certification Sales French Music DVD ChartFrench Music DVD Chart Platinum 20,000 U.S. Billboard Top Music VideoU.S. Billboard Top Music Video 15 Platinum 100,000RIAA ==References== Category:Mariah Carey albums Category:1999 albums Category:Video albums",
