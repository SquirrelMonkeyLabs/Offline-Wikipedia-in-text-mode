 "text": "Montgomery High School is a public school in San Diego, California. It teaches students in grades 9 through 12. The school opened in 1970. It is in the Otay Mesa area. The school is named after John J. Montgomery, who was one of the first people in the U.S. to fly a glider. == History == In 1975, the school started a garden as part of a class about nature. Students learned by working outside. The garden was shown on a TV show hosted by Huell Howser. That class no longer exists. In 2006, the classrooms were fixed and made better. In 2009 and 2010, the school built a new sports field. In 2012, the field was named after a staff member, Al Prazak. He worked at the school for many years. In 2011, the school built a new office, library, and more classrooms. The library was named after the first principal, Joseph Torres. The school also made the yard and gym look nicer. In 2009, the school had low test scores. The district brought in a new principal and made changes. Some teachers were not happy, but the school improved.
