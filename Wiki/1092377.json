On July 16, 2008, Caylee was reported missing in a 9-1-1 call made by Cindy, who said she had not seen the child for thirty-one days. According to what Cindy told police dispatchers, Casey had given varied explanations as to Caylee's whereabouts before eventually saying she had not seen her daughter for 31 days. Casey falsely told a dispatcher that Caylee had been kidnapped by a nanny. Casey was charged with first-degree murder in October 2008 and pleaded not guilty.
