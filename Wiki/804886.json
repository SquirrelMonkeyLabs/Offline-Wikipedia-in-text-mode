 "text": "Marcus Terentius Varro Reatinus (116 â€“ 27 BC) was a Roman writer. He wrote many books, but only one work survives completely - Three books on Agriculture. In this work, he describes farming in Roman times. Scholars say this book has a little microbiology and epidemiology. Varro warned his contemporaries to stay away from swamps and marshes: > ...there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, > but which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and > cause serious diseases. ==References== Category:110s BC births Category:20s BC deaths Category:Ancient Roman writers Category:2nd-century BC writers Category:1st-century BC writers",
