 "text": "The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial is in West Potomac Park next to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., United States. It covers and includes the Stone of Hope, a granite statue of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King. The inspiration for the memorial design is a line from King's \"I Have A Dream\" speech: \"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\" The memorial opened to the public on August 22, 2011, after more than twenty years of planning, fund-raising, and construction. ==References== Category:Martin Luther King Jr. Category:Buildings and structures in Washington, D.C.",
