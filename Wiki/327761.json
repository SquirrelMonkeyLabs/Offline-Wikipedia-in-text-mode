 "text": "Blush or rouge is a type of cosmetic put on the cheeks, usually in red or pink. It can be a powder, a liquid, or a cream. Blush is almost always used by girls and not often used by boys except for in acting. Blush was first used by Egyptians in 3000 BC. In the 1800s, wearing cosmetics made people think a woman had bad character, so people from that time would pinch their cheeks to make them red. Some blushes can have shimmer, but most are flat in colour. The brush that is used to put on blush, is a brush that is more large than a eye shadow brush. Liquid and cream blush can be put on with fingers, too. Category:Cosmetics",
