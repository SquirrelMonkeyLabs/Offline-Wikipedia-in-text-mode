 "text": "The Sievert, abbreviated Sv is the SI unit to measure the equivalent dose and committed dose of an ionizing radiation, which represent the risk of bodily radiation dosage and harm as a result of it. It looks at how an organism reacts to a given dose. This is different from measuring the total absorbed dose, which is measured in grays. This unit is important in [radiation protection] and medical treatments such as [radiotherapy]. It is named after Rolf Sievert, a Swedish physicist and doctor, who did research on how radiation affects organisms. Category:SI derived units Category:Units of radioactivity",
