 "text": "Co-amoxiclav is an antibiotic that is also known as Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. It is used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, animal bites, and urinary tract infections. The antibiotic is also used in veterinary practices and is commonly given to farm animals and pets against similar infections. Its brand name in the United Kingdom is Augmentin and is only available on prescription. == Resistance == Because the antibiotic is used widely amongst humans and animals, bacterial resistance to this antibiotic is growing. == History == Co-amoxiclav was identified in 1972 by a group of scientists in Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline). It was launched as Augmentin in the United Kingdom in 1981. It is a combination of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin. It is now on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines, meaning it is very important in modern medicine. == Side effects == As with most antibiotics, some side effects of Co-amoxiclav include vomiting, diarrhea and headaches. A history of problems with penicillin is also an indicator that Co-amoxiclav should not be taken. == References == Category:Antibiotics",
