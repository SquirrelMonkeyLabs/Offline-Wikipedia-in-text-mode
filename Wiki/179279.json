Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1988: 524. His novels and short stories are cautionary tales. They suggest that guilt, sin, and evil are the most inherent natural qualities of humanity. Many of his works are inspired by Puritan New England. They combine historical romance loaded with symbolism and deep psychological themes. They border upon surrealism. His depictions of the past are a version of historical fiction used only as a vehicle to express common themes of ancestral sin, guilt and retribution.Crews, 28–29 == Early life == Hawthorne's dad, William Hathorne (Hawthorne later added the 'w' to seperate himself), Hawthorne, a famous short story author, whose childhood was not very good.
