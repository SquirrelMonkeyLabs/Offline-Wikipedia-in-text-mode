 "text": "La Maison Simons (also known as Simons) is a Canadian chain of fashion and department stores. They have headquarters in Quebec City, Quebec. They have 19 store locations in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia. In 1812, Scottish-born Peter Simons moved to a farm in Lower Canada and had a family. His son John opened a dry goods store in 1840 and shipped merchandise across the Atlantic Ocean back to his store. After World War II, they decided to change the business model from goods to a department store and fashion retailer, seeing a large growth in sales afterwards. On October 31, 2012, Simons expanded outside of Quebec for the first time when they opened their West Edmonton Mall store in Edmonton, Alberta. In 2022, Bernard Leblanc was named as the new CEO of Simons. On June 6, 2024, La Maison Simons announced that they were going to expand and open two stores in Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto to take over the former Nordstrom buildings. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1840 establishments Category:Companies based in Quebec Category:Department stores of Canada",
