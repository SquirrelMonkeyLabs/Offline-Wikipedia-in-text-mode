 "text": "In chemistry a proton is a positively charged hydrogen ion. According to IUPAC, the name hydron should be used for such a particle. In this sense, a hydron can be a proton in the sense of physics, a deuteron or a triton. A deuteron is the ion of deuterium, a triton that of tritium. (So chemists use the term hydron because it covers all three hydrogen ion isotopes.) In 1923, Johannes Nicolaus Br√∏nsted and Thomas Lowry used hydrons to describe acids and bases. They defined acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors. ==References== Category:Chemistry Category:Cations Category:Hydrogen",
