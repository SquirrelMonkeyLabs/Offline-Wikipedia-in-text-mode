 "text": "The hidden walking leaf frog (Phyllomedusa tetraploidea) is a frog that lives in Brazil, Argentina, and part of Paraguay. People have seen it between 400 and 1000 meters above sea level. Scientists do not think this frog is in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in such a big place and because people have found it in places that humans have changed, such as places where cows eat grass. This frog lives both in rainforests that have never been cut down, rainforests that have been cut down and grew back, and swamps. The female frog lays her eggs on leaves over the water. The tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
