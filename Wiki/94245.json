 "text": "Ashoka was a famous emperor of the Mauryan Dynasty of Magadh ruling South Asia who ruled from 268-232 BC. His name means \"Without Sorrow\". Ashoka is often cited as one of India's greatest emperors. After a number of military conquests, he fought a war with the kingdom of Kalinga in which there was said to be 200,000+ casualties. He conquered Kalinga (present-day Odisha) around 261 BCE. Afterwards, shaken by his brutal victory, he decided to leave weapons and lead with peace, not war. To do this, he set up hospitals for animals and humans, created shaded and rested areas along roads for weary travellers to rest, and dug wells in villages. We know these things about his life through various inscriptions (writing) on rocks and pillars. Ashoka also convinced people to follow Dharma. The national emblem of India and the \"Ashok Chakra\" are created by Ashoka. It is in the flag to keep a remembrance of him. == References == ==Notes== Category:4th-century BC births Category:232 BC deaths Category:Indian monarchs Category:History of India Category:History of Pakistan",
