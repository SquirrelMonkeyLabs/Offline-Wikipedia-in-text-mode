 "text": "Eureka is a small city in California in the United States, and the county seat of Humboldt County. In 2020, 26,512 people lived there. It is north of San Francisco. == Climate == Eureka has a very mild temperate climate with only very small temperature fluctuations between summer and winter. This is due to the cool California Current, whose water temperature is between and all year round. Under the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, Eureka has a cool-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb), due to the low rainfall during summer. The average summer temperatures in Eureka are much cooler than in New York City and Istanbul, which are on the same latitude. Summer temperatures are unusually cool for the 40th latitude, and are similar to those of southern Alaska, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Tierra del Fuego in the extreme south of Chile and Argentina, which are far north and south of the 50th latitude. The average winter temperatures are also much milder than in New York and Istanbul, and in contrast to these two cities, frost and snow do not occur every year. Snow is particularly rare and falls at most once or twice a decade. ==Notes== == References == Category:Settlements in Humboldt County, California Category:Cities in California Category:County seats in California",
