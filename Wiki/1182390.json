A video of the direct preparations for the campaign has now been published. While the guerrillas carry out daily sniper operations, sabotage operations and attacks with heavy weapons against the Turkish occupiers in small units, revolutionary operations have taken place in recent weeks in which several guerrilla units have acted in coordination against one target. The Turkish army suffered heavy losses in these operations. One of these operations was the revolutionary operation Şehîd Leyla Sorxwîn Amed in the southern Kurdish region of Metina. At least 18 Turkish soldiers were killed in the operation and large amounts of military material were confiscated. There were no casualties on the guerrilla side == References == https://anfenglishmobile.com/features/footage-of-equipment-seized-from-the- killed-turkish-soldiers-whose-deaths-are-kept-secret- 7086 https://www.hezaparastin.com/ru/index.php/our-international-martyrs/ebu-leyla- sehid-a-brave-warrior-of-the-arab-people https://hawarnews.com/en/gerila-tv- releases-footage-of-martyr-leyla-amed-revolutionary-operation https://hawarnews.com/en/gerila-tv-releases-footage-of-martyr-leyla-amed- revolutionary-operation",
