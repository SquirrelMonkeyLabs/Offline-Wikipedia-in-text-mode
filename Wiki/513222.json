Salem is WGN America's first scripted series. Janet Montgomery and Shane West are the main actors/actresses of the show. Salem is influenced by the Salem Witch Trials in the 17th century. == Overview == Salem is a fictional story that is based on the real Salem Witch Trials in colonial Massachusetts. The Massachusetts government at the time was dominated by conservative Puritan leaders. Unlike today there was little difference between church and state., The Salem Witch Trials (Minneapolis: Lerner Pub. Co., 1997), p. 21 In 1692 the Puritan colony was affected by young girls \"crying out\" accusations of devil worship against other members of the congregation. A mix of fear and superstition caused a hysteria among the Puritans that devil- worshiping witches were among them. A mob mentality caused people to torture and execute others women (and a few men) for no reason other than hysteria over the possibility of them being witches. Over 150 people were accused of being witches and placed on trial. Salem, the WGN America series, reworks this history into a fictional story full of magic, witches as actual beings, and sexy characters. In the TV series the main characters, John Alden (Shane West) and Mary Sibley (Janet Montgomery), find themselves in love even though the whole town is in a frenzy over witch hunts. The New York Times review called it \"perversely entertaining.\" == Cast == Most of the characters are based on the names of real people. * Janet Montgomery as Mary Sibley * Shane West as Captain John Alden * Seth Gabel as Cotton Mather * Tamzin Merchant as Anne Hale * Ashley Madekwe as Tituba * Elise Eberle as Mercy Lewis * Iddo Goldberg as Isaac Walton * Xander Berkeley as Magistrate Hale * Oliver Bell as John * Joe Doyle as Baron Sebastian von Marburg == Reviews == Salem scored 49 out of 100, based on 16 critic reviews on Metacritic.
