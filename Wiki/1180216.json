 "text": "The Red List of Venezuelan Fauna, Venezuelan Fauna Red List, or Listo Rojo de la Fauna Venezolana is a group of scientists that study animals in Venezuela and tell whether they are safe or in danger of dying out and by how much. ==Start== The Red List of Venezuelan Fauna came from the Red Book of Venezuelan Fauna. The book first came out in 1995, and again in 1999 and 2003. The organization that made it tried to give many books to schools and other places, but they decided it would be better to give people information using electronics. The Red List first let regular people join its website in 2013. At that time, 81 scientists, 11 photographers, and 20 artists had looked at more than 4000 species. ==Updates== Unlike other lists of animals, which update every few years, people can write new information in the Venezuelan Fauna Red List at any time. The List has three main editors who look at the whole list and eighteen other editors who look at the types of animals they know best to check new information. == References== Category:Biological databases Category:Environmental organizations",
