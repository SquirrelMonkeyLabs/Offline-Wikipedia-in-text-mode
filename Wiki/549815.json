 "text": "Apple Maps is a mapping service. It is an app that comes with every iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, and Apple Watch, but not available on the web. It gives information about local businesses and their ratings, and reads driving directions as one is driving; or on an Apple Watch, it will vibrate when one needs to turn. Apple Maps is also known for its 3D views of many major metro areas, which has been compared favorably to Google Earth. It started in 2012, but when it started many users did not trust it and went back to using Google Maps. Apple has been busy fixing it so users can trust it, and nowadays Apple Maps is used 3.5 times as much as Google Maps on devices Apple Maps is supported. At first, Apple Maps was only on iOS, but Apple has made it so Apple Maps can also be used on Macs and Apple Watches. In iOS 17 update, Apple Maps users can download offline maps. == References == Category:Maps Category:Apple software",
