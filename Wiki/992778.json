 "text": "Terence Davies (10 November 1945 â€“ 7 October 2023) was a British screenwriter, film director, and novelist. He was born into an English working-class family in Liverpool, England. After years of low-level jobs he began studies at Coventry School of Drama in 1971 and later at the National Film School. He wrote a screenplay for his first short film, Children. This would be the first of three short movies that are known as The Terence Davies Trilogy. He is best known as the writer and director of movies based on his own life, including Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988), The Long Day Closes (1992) and Of Time and the City (2008). He has made movies based on novels, such as The House of Mirth (2000) and The Neon Bible (1995). His movies A Quiet Passion (2016) and Benediction (2021) are based on the lives of poets Emily Dickinson and Siegfried Sassoon. Davies lived in Mistley, Essex. In a 2022 interview, he said that he preferred to live alone and was single for much of his life, except for a heterosexual relationship in the late 1970s, \"[when] there was still this attitude of: 'Well, find the right person and you'll be happy'\"; he was subsequently uninterested in relationships with men, saying \"I did go on to the gay scene for a couple of months and I thought, it's just not for me\". Davies died at his home on 7 October 2023, at the age of 77, following a short illness. ==Movies== Year Title Notes 1976 Children short 1980 Madonna and Child short 1983 Death and Transfiguration short 1988 Distant Voices, Still Lives 1992 The Long Day Closes 1995 The Neon Bible 2000 The House of Mirth 2008 Of Time and the City documentary 2011 The Deep Blue Sea 2015 Sunset Song 2016 A Quiet Passion 2021 Benediction ==References== Category:1945 births Category:2023 deaths Category:Movie directors Category:English LGBT writers Category:Writers from Liverpool",
