 "text": "Dogecoin is a Bitcoin-based digital currency (cryptocurrency). It was created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer on 8 December 2013, and was inspired by the Shiba Inu featured in the \"Doge\" internet meme. Sunday, February 23, 2020 Palmer and Markus launched the coin on Dec. 6, 2013. Two weeks later on Dec. 19, the value of Dogecoin jumped 300%, perhaps due to China forbidding its banks from investing in cryptocurrency. Doge functions based on the Scrypt technology. It has unlimited emission, and fast transaction processing speed. Users can buy and sell Dogecoin on digital currency exchanges. They can opt to store their Dogecoin on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet. Dogecoin.com promotes the currency as the \"fun and friendly Internet currency\", referencing its origins as a \"joke.\" Elon Musk frequently mentions or talks about Dogecoin on his Twitter account, boosting its popularity significantly in recent years. ==References== Category:Cryptocurrency",
