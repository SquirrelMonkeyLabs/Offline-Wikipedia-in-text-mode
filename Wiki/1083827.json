 "text": "The 2024 Tasmanian state election was held on 23 March 2024 to elect all 35 members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. It was conducted by the Tasmanian Electoral Commission (TEC). The 10-year-incumbent centre-right Liberal government, led by Jeremy Rockliff, was re-elected for the fourth time in a row, defeating the centre-left Labor opposition, led by Opposition Leader Rebecca White. Minor parties, such as the left-wing Greens (led by Rosalie Woodruff) and the big tent Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN), also contested this election. There was a big swing against the Liberal Party with almost 12 per cent fewer than the 2021 election. JLN, Labor, the Greens and independents all had positive swings. The Liberals remained the largest party in the House of Assembly by both seats and vote share, but no party could form a majority government. The Liberal Party will form a minority government instead, with Rockliff as Premier, because Labor said they would not be able to form a government with their current seat numbers and declared that they had lost the election. White resigned as Labor leader and was replaced by Dean Winter after a leadership election. It is the first time in the state's history that the Tasmanian Liberal Party has been re-elected a fourth term in government. The number of seats had also increased from 25 to 35, with 7 seats per electorate. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Elections in Tasmania Category:2024 elections in Australia Category:21st century in Tasmania Category:March 2024 events",
