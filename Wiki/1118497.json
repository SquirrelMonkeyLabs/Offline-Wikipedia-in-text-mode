Six candidates were approved to appear on the ballot, however two candidates dropped out before voting began. Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri and former Speaker Ali Larijani applied to run, however their candidacies were rejected. ==Approved candidates== The registration to run for the presidency started on 30 May and ended on 3 June. A total of 80 people, including four women, filed their candidacies for president. Most candidates were seen as conservatives or ultra conservatives. The final list of candidates was released by the Guardian Council on 9 June. Per Article 99 of the Constitution, those rejected by the council are not allowed to protest the rejection.
