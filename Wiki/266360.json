 "text": "The Battle of Actium decided the final war of the Roman Republic. It was fought between the forces of Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. The battle took place on 2 September 31 BC, on the Ionian Sea near the Roman colony of Actium in Greece. Octavian's fleet was commanded by Agrippa, while Antony's fleet was supported by the ships of his lover, Queen Cleopatra of Egypt. Octavian's victory enabled him to consolidate his power over Rome and its dominions. To that end, he adopted the title of Princeps (\"first citizen\"). As a result of the victory he was awarded the title of Augustus by the Roman Senate. As Augustus, he would keep the trappings of a restored Republican leader. However, historians view this as the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire.Paul K.
