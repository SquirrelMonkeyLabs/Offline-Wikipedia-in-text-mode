Through his artwork he has always honored women, but he has also denounced the world´s horrors of famine and war. He was born in Polia, Calabria, Italy. His 1975 exhibit at the San Martín Cultural Center was a particular success, and Pujía added his entire warehouse of works to the initial display. He lived in Spain from 1975 to 1976, working in the renowned Escorial Museum.
