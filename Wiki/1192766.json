 "text": "\"Jikkyo Powerful Pro Baseball Basic Edition 2001\" is a baseball game for the Nintendo 64 released by Konami on March 29, 2001. This was Konami's last game title for ROM cassettes in Japan. This work is based on \"Jikkyo Powerful Pro Baseball 2000\", with adjustments to the baseball portion and updated player data to the 2001 edition.Cabrera, who was a member of the Seibu Lions at the time, was registered under the name \"Cabrera.\" The same is true for Power Pro Kun Pocket 3. The biggest feature is that there is no Success Mode.Instead, players created in \"Power Pro Pocket 3\" and \"Power Pro 2000\" can be moved using a password. The reason is unknown, but the audio commentary and the names of some of the new players and new foreign players by the announcers are not recorded. In this game, players created in Power Pro Pocket 3 will also have super special abilities. With the exception of the GC versions of Jikkyo Powerful Pro Baseball 11 and Jikkyo Powerful Pro Baseball 12, during the dual platform period of PlayStation 2 and Nintendo hardware (PowerPro 9-12, 14 (Wii), 15), super special abilities are erased when transferred.In Jikkyo Powerful Pro Baseball NEXT, which returned to the Nintendo single platform, super special abilities were once again enabled.",
