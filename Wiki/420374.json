He played college football for University of Utah. Smith was the first person taken in the 2005 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He played for the 49ers between 2005 and 2013. During a game against the Houston Texans on November 18, 2018, Smith was sacked by Kareem Jackson and J. J. Watt. The hit caused Smith's right leg to break. When Smith was getting surgery, he developed necrotizing fasciitis and almost had to get his leg amputated. In July 2020, doctors said he was able to return to football. The team cleared him to play on August 16, 2020. On October 11, Smith made his return in a 30-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. On April 19, 2021, Smith announced that he was retiring from playing professional football. ==References== Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:San Francisco 49ers players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Sportspeople from Washington (state) Category:People from Bremerton, Washington",
