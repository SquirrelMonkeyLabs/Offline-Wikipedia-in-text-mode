 "text": "Cabrini–Green Homes was a public housing project on the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois. The Francis Cabrini Rowhouses and Extensions were in the Cabrini–Green neighborhood. Cabrini-Green was home to 15,000 people, mostly living in mid- and high-rise apartment buildings. Crime in the area caused poor living conditions for many residents. \"Cabrini-Green\" became a well known example for problems caused by public housing in the United States. In 1995, CHA began tearing down mid- and high-rise buildings, with the last demolished in 2011. Today, only the original, two-story rowhouses remain. The area has been rebuilt through the building of high-rises and townhouses, causing it to become a mixed-income neighborhood. ==References== Category:Chicago",
