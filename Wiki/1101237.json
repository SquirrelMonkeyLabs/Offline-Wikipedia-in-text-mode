 "text": "In the early days of the International Phonetic Alphabet, they had special handwriting forms of the letters meant for writing by hand or taking notes in the field. The 1999 Handbook of the International Phonetic Association mentioned that back when people had to write down speech by hand quickly, these cursive forms might have been more helpful because they allowed for faster writing. But for most people, these cursive forms are difficult to read. It's better to use handwritten versions that look more like the printed symbols. == Development == == Example == The following passage is from the 1912 edition of the International Phonetic Assocation handbook: IPA Orthography The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first made the traveller take off his cloak should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew with all his might, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak; and so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two. ==References== Category:Alphabets",
