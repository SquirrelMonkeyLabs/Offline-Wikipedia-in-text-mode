 "text": "The inauguration of Grover Cleveland as the 22nd president of the United States happened on March 4, 1885. The inauguration was the beginning of the first four-year term of Grover Cleveland as president and the only term of Thomas A. Hendricks as vice president. Vice president Hendricks did not finish his term because he died on November 25, 1885. As there was no system in place to put a replacement for him to serve the rest of his term, his position remained unfilled until the end of Cleveland's term. The ceremony happened at the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The event was the 25th presidential inauguration. Chief Justice Morrison Waite administered the presidential oath of office, and Cleveland used a Bible given to him at age 15 by his mother to take the oath. Cleveland's second inauguration took place eight years after the first, as his two terms in office were not back-to-back. He is the first U.S. president to serve two terms that were not back-to-back. ==References== ==Other websites== * Text of Cleveland's First Inaugural Address Category:United States presidential inaugurations inauguration 1",
