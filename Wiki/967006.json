 "text": "Gregory House is the main character of the series House M. D. (2004-2012), played by the British actor Hugh Laurie. A physician by profession, specializing in infectious diseases and nephrology, the character leads a diagnostic team at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro University Hospital and is described as bitter, sarcastic, cynical, sometimes manic, misanthropic, narcissistic, and curmudgeonly. Precisely, this last adjective was one of the most popular words in 2006 thanks to the character of the protagonist of the series. House's unorthodox diagnostic methods, alternative therapies, and unconditional rationality result in various conflicts with his fellow professionals. House is often portrayed as lacking in sympathy and compassion towards his patients, a practice that allows you to solve pathological enigmas. ==Reception== Throughout the series' run, the character received positive reviews. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called House \"the most electrifying character to hit television in years\". ==References== Category:Television characters",
