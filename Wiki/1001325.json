He was the father of George Washington, the first president of the United States. He belonged to the Colony of Virginia's landed gentry. Like his father and his sons, Washington had owned plantations which he operated by the use of enslaved labor. He also speculated in less developed land and had even operated in an iron mine. Unlike his father and his son George, Washington was never a legislator. He held various offices in the counties where he had land. Washington's first wife was Jane Butler, who died in November of 1729. His second wife was Mary Ball Washington, the mother of George Washington. He was the son of Lawrence Washington and his wife, Mildred Gale. ==Children== ===Children (by Jane Butler)=== * Butler Washington (1716–1716) * Lawrence Washington (1718–1752) * Augustine Washington Jr. (1720–1762) * Jane Washington (1722–1735) ===Children (by Mary Ball)=== * George Washington (1732–1799), the first president of the United States * Elizabeth Washington (1733–1797) * Samuel Washington (1734–1781) * John Augustine Washington (1736–1787) * Charles Washington (1738–1799) * Mildred Washington (1739–1740) Category:George Washington Category:1694 births Category:1743 deaths Category:People from Virginia",
