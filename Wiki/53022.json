 "text": "Darth Revan is a fictional character from the Star Wars universe and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Revan was a Jedi Knight and general who turned to the dark side in the Mandalorian Wars. After the death of Mandalore the Ultimate, Revan claimed the title of \"Dark Lord of the Sith\". He then founded a powerful new Sith Empire, and declared war on the Republic and the Jedi themselves. After defeating almost all of the Republic territories, Revan was captured by the Jedi due to the betrayal of his apprentice Darth Malak. He almost died (a small spark of the Force kept him alive) and was brought to the Council to have his mind replaced by a new identity that was loyal to the Republic. Even after discovering his former identity, he rejected the dark side. Revan ended the war he had begun by killing Malak. After the Jedi Civil War, Revan was given back his rank as Jedi Knight at age 26. He used two lightsabers one purple and one red this symbolised that he was equal in the force but still was tilted to the dark side. He was the lover of Bastila Shan. A year later, all his memories returned. He later left to the Unknown Regions to face this new threat known as the \"True Sith\". ==References== Category:Star Wars characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2003 Category:Video game characters",
