 "text": "The Charites (; , Khárites; sing. Χάρις), also known as the Graces, are three minor goddesses of charm, beauty, grace, and splendor in Greek mythology. They were the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome, and served as handmaidens of Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty. In Roman mythology they are known as the Gratiae (the “Graces”). They are often shown in sculptures and mosaics as three naked women, holding hands and dancing in a circle. Their names are Euphrosyne (\"the light-hearted one\"), Thalia (\"the flowering one\"), and Aglaia (\"the shining one\"). ==References== Category:Greek gods and goddesses Category:Roman gods and goddesses",
