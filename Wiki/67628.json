 "text": "Jorge Luis Borges (August 24, 1899 – June 14, 1986) was an Argentine writer. He was best known in the English-speaking world for his short stories and fictive essays. Borges was also a poet, critic, translator and man of wisdom. He was influenced by authors such as Dante Alighieri, Miguel de Cervantes, Franz Kafka, H.G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Schopenhauer and G. K. Chesterton. == Quotations == * \"The earth we inhabit is an error, an incompetent parody. Mirrors and paternity are abominable because they multiply and affirm it.\" — (dogma of a fictional religion in \"Hakim, the masked dyer of Merv\". Part of this quote is also attributed to a heresiarch of Uqbar in \"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\".) * \"The central fact of my life has been the existence of words and the possibility of weaving those words into poetry.\" * \"I do not write for a select minority, which means nothing to me, nor for that adulated platonic entity known as 'The Masses'. Both abstractions, so dear to the demagogue, I disbelieve in. I write for myself and for my friends, and I write to ease the passing of time.\" — Introduction to The Book of Sand * \"I have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library.\" == Other websites == *Borges Center, University of Iowa : important internet resources including bibliographies, chronologies, full text articles and books, and information on the journal Variaciones Borges * BBC Radio 4: In Our Time Archive page for edition about Borges in a series on the 'History of Ideas'.
