 "text": "Worlds End was a professional wrestling pay-per-view made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It was held on December 30, 2023 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. It was the first World's End event to take place and the first AEW pay-per-view to take place in New York. The main event of the show saw Samoa Joe defeat Maxwell Jacob Friedman (MJF) to win the AEW World Championship. MJF tired to hit Joe with his Dynamite Diamond Ring while the referee was knocked down. Joe countered this, put MJF in a choke and made MJF pass out to win the match. After the match, the lights went out and come back on. When the lights came on, a returning Adam Cole sat in the ring with four masked men. The men pulled off their masks and revealed themselves to be The Kingdom (Matt Taven & Mike Bennett), Roderick Strong, and Wardlow. They attacked MJF after his match and Cole pulled The Devil mask out of his jacket, therefore revealing himself to be The Devil and betraying MJF. The finals of the Continental Classic also took place during the event. In the finals, Eddie Kingston defeated Jon Moxley to retain his ROH World Championship and NJPW Strong Openweight Championship. He also became a Triple Crown Champion when he won the first AEW Continental Championship. Also, Andrade El Idolo had his last match in AEW at the event. AEW owner Tony Khan said during the post event press scrum that Andrade's contract had expired. ==Matches== No. Results Stipulations Times 1 Willow Nightingale defeated Kris Statlander Singles match 13:25 2 Killswitch won by last eliminating Trent Beretta 20-man Battle Royale for a future AEW TNT Championship match 13:50 3 Hook (c) defeated Wheeler Yuta FTW Rules match for the FTW Championship 10:20 4 Blackpool Combat Club (Claudio Castagnoli and Bryan Danielson), Mark Briscoe, and Daniel Garcia defeated Brody King, Jay White, Jay Lethal, and Rush Eight-man tag team match 17:50 5 Miro defeated Andrade El Idolo (with CJ) Singles match 14:45 6 \"Timeless\" Toni Storm (c) (with Luther) defeated Riho Singles match for the AEW Women's World Championship 11:40 7 Swerve Strickland (with Prince Nana) defeated Dustin Rhodes Singles match 9:30 8 Le Sex Gods (Chris Jericho and Sammy Guevara), Sting, and Darby Allin defeated Ricky Starks, Big Bill, and The Don Callis Family (Konosuke Takeshita and Powerhouse Hobbs) (with Don Callis) Eight-man tag team match 15:40 9 Julia Hart (c) defeated Abadon \"House Rules\" match for the AEW TBS Championship 11:35 10 Adam Copeland defeated Christian Cage (c) (with Mother Wayne and \"The Prodigy\" Nick Wayne) No Disqualification match for the AEW TNT Championship 25:00 11 Christian Cage (with Mother Wayne, \"The Prodigy\" Nick Wayne, and Killswitch) defeated Adam Copeland (c) Singles match for the AEW TNT Championship 0:11 12 Eddie Kingston (c) (ROH World and NJPW Strong Openweight Champion) defeated Jon Moxley Finals of the Continental Classic to crown the first American Triple Crown Champion (ROH World Championship, NJPW Strong Openweight Championship, and the first AEW Continental Championship) 17:20 13 Samoa Joe defeated MJF (c) (with Adam Cole) Singles match for the AEW World Championship 17:50 ==References== Category:2023 in sports Category:2023 in the United States Category:All Elite Wrestling shows Category:Sports in New York (state)",
