 "text": "The anatidae are the biological family of birds that includes the ducks, geese and swans.Carboneras, Carles 1992. Family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). In: del Hoyo, Josep; Elliott, Andrew & Sargatal, Jordi (eds): Handbook of Birds of the World (volume 1: Ostrich to Ducks): 536â€“629. Lynx Editions, Barcelona. These birds are common and widespread, and live in or near water. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, on all the world's continents except Antarctica and on most of the world's islands and island groups. These are birds that are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases diving. The family has about 146 species in 40 genera. They are usually herbivorous, and are monogamous breeders. A number of species do annual migrations. A few species have been domesticated for agriculture, and many others are hunted for food and recreation. Five species have become extinct since 1600, and others are close to extinction. == References ==",
