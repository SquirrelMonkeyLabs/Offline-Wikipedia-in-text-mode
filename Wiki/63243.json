 "text": "A pipe is a tube or hollow cylinder for the transport of fluid. The terms 'pipe' and 'tube' can be used for the same objects. 'Pipe' is generally specified by the internal diameter (ID) whereas 'tube' is usually defined by the outside diameter (OD) but may be specified by any combination of dimensions (OD, ID, wall thickness). 'Tube' is often made to custom sizes and may often have more specific sizes and tolerances than pipe. The terms 'tube' and 'tubing' are more widely used in the US and 'pipe' elsewhere in the world. Both \"pipe\" and \"tube\" imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a 'hose' is usually portable and flexible. == Uses == * Domestic water systems * Pipeline containing high pressure gas or fluid * Scaffolding * Structural steel * As components in mechanical systems such as: ** Rollers in conveyor belts ** Compactors (E.g.: steam rollers) ** Bearing casing * Casing for concrete pilings used in construction projects * High temperature or pressure manufacturing processes * The petroleum industry: ** Oil well casing ** Oil refinery equipment * The construction of high pressure storage vessels == Pipe cutter == Pipe cutters for thin plastic pipes are like scissors. For cutting pipes of large diameter, with thicker walls and made of harder materials, pipe cutters are used, which are a clamp with a cutting wheel, pressure rollers and a lever. == Notes == ==Related pages== * Pipe (disambiguation page) == References == * * Category:Engineering",
