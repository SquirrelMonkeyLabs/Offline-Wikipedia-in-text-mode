 "text": "Belonostomus is an extinct genus of prehistoric ray-finned fish in the order Aspidorhynchiformes. Fossils have been found in marine areas, although some species are known from freshwater habitats. Usually, it fed on plankton or other tiny fish, but one fossil was found devouring a Homoeosaurus as stomach contents. == Description == Belonostomus, like all aspidorhyncheans, has a pointy rostrum. However, it is thinner compared to other genera like the almost identical Aspidorhynchus. It possesses a long body. == Gallery == == References == # Bryant, Laurie J.
