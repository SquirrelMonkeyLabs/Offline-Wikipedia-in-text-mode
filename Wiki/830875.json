She is well-known for opposing the actions of France in Africa, which her and others describe as colonial. She was born in Switzerland and grew up in Cameroon, then went to university in Germany. In the 2010s, she helped run a political party in Ivory Coast. However, she was deported in 2019 without a trial after she criticized the Ivory Coast government at a conference in Russia. Her anti-French activism earned her in January 2022 a ban on entry and stay on French territory, made public in October 2022. Yamb participated as an \"independent international observer\" during 2022 sham referendums in Eastern Ukraine.https://rusieurope.eu/hidden-in-plain-sight- pro-kremlin-pan-african-influencers-and-the-threat-to-africa-s-stability-and- democracy/https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-society/3766407-putins-friends-and- prigozhins-network-foreign-observers-in-pseudo-elections-in-occupied- areas.html ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Cameroonian activists Category:Ivorian politicians Category:Swiss politicians Category:People from La Chaux-de-Fonds",
