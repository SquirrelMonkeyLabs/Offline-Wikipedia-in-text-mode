 "text": "Guidance Patrol (), or morality police, is a vice squad/Islamic religious police in Iran. It was created in 2005. Their job is to arrest people who do not follow the Islamic dress code, usually concerning the wearing by women of hijabs covering their hair. After protests by the Iranian people, the government said they would stop the Patrol by the end of 2022. However, this may not be true. ==References== Category:Islamic law Category:Islamic dress Category:Controversies Category:Clothing controversies Category:Women's rights Category:Human rights abuses in Asia Category:2005 establishments Category:2000s establishments in Iran Category:2022 in Iran Category:Organisations based in Iran",
