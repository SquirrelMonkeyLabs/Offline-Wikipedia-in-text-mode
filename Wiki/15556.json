 "text": "Etymology is the study of the origin and meaning of words and names. It tells us how words have changed over time, and what other languages they came from. For example, the etymology of the word etymology is from the Greek words ἔτυμον (étymon, \"true meaning\", from etymos \"true\") and λόγος (lógos, \"word\" or \"study\"). == References == == Bibliography == * Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003).
