Palmer is most noted in Alaska as the place of the yearly Alaska State Fair. Twelve miles north of Palmer is Hatcher pass. The pass is a state park and is home of the Independence Mine. Also in the past Palmer served as a gateway to the Alaska interior for fur traders, trappers, gold miners and serves as place where people can live a life on the frontier. == History == The first people that lived in the Matanuska Valley were the Dena’ina and Ahtna Athabaskans. http://www.palmerhistoricalsociety.org The town was founded by an Alaska pioneer named George W. Palmer in 1893. He started to build a trading post to trade and supply for the people living in the Matanuska Valley with foods, goods, mail, fur, etc. In 1913 Palmer served as a place for miners to lead an agricultural lifestyle after they returned from the Nelchina gold stampede. Which made them the first people who have settled there. In 1935 the Federal Emergency Relief Administration established the Matanuska Colony which was under President Franklin Roosevelt. From the drought-starved Midwest, 203 families traveled by train and ship to reach the fledgling colony. Their housing was in a tent city for that first Alaskan summer. From there each family drew out lots of individual 40-acre tracts and a farming adventure began. == Agriculture == What Palmer is known for is its agricultural lifestyle. https://www.palmerak.org/discover-palmer/page/history-palmer Also growing a lot of vegetables especially growing pumpkins, green cabbages, beets, and turnips.
