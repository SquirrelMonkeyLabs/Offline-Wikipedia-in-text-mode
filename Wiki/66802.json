 "text": "Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus. Unlike the other common forms of hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), it does not cause chronic (long-term) liver disease. ==How is hepatitis A spread?== When a person has hepatitis A, the virus stays in their feces. Hepatitis A is usually spread by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with infected feces. For example, hepatitis A can be spread by: * Using ice that was made from contaminated water * Eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods that are not cooked, which may have gotten contaminated when a person with hepatitis A prepared them ** Foods that are not cooked are more likely to spread hepatitis A because cooking food will kill the virus * Eating shellfish that lived in contaminated water, and were not cooked well enough to kill the virus Hepatitis A can also be spread by having sex with someone who has hepatitis A. ==Signs and symptoms== *Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes) *Abdominal pain *Fever *Nausea and Vomiting *Fatigue *Anorexia (loss of the desire to eat)Mayo clinic: Hepatitis symptoms ==Treatment and prognosis== There is no medication that can cure hepatitis A. In most cases, the infection resolves on its own. In most cases, symptoms last less than 2 months, although some people are sick for as long as six months. Unfortunately, a small number of patients develop Fulminant hepatic failure, which is very serious. ==Prevention== A vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A, and anti- hepatitis A immunoglobulin is also used. ==References== Category:Diseases caused by viruses Category:Liver disease",
