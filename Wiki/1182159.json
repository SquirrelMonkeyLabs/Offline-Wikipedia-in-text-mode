 "text": "Flocking is a type of behavior. It is shown when a group of birds, called a flock, are looking for food or in flight. Sheep and goats also show flocking behavior. Computer simulations and mathematical models have been built to copy the flocking behaviours of birds. The term \"flocking\" is sometimes used, in computer science, for living things that are not birds. Here, it means a group of organisms moving together. This can be seen in many living beings such as fish, bacteria, and insects. Flocking is considered an emergent behaviour. It appears from simple rules that each organism follows. No one organisms in the group controls everything. == References == Category:Biology",
