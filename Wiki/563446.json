 "text": "The Brahmanas are a collection of Indian books. The books give more information on the Vedas, the four holiest books of the Hindu religion. The Brahmanas give instructions on the proper performance of rituals. They also explain the original symbolic meanings. Each Vedic shakha (school) has its own Brahmana. Many Brahmana texts existed in ancient India. Most of these have been lost.Moriz Winternitz (2010), A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 175-176 ==References== Category:Hinduism",
