 "text": "Zoe is a character from the TV show Sesame Street. She is an orange monster who is 3 years old and is very energetic. Her introduction was in 1993. Zoe was originally unclothed except her barrettes, bracelets, and necklace. She has regularly been dressed in a tutu since 2001, as like many girls of her age, Zoe is obsessed with ballet. Her love of dance in general resulted in the video Zoe's Dance Moves. In Season 49, she wears her tutu less frequently, and more consistently in illustrations and merchandise. She is currently played by Jennifer Barnhart, but was first played by Fran Brill. ==References== Category:Sesame Street characters",
