According to the studies of Cecilio Robelo, Toluca means 'where the god Tolo is' or 'hill of the god Tolo' or 'place of the god Tolo'. Its grammatical roots are toloqui, from toloa, 'to bow or lower the head'. In 1861 by decree of the local legislature, the municipality took the official name of Toluca de Lerdo, in memory of the politician Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada who was still alive at that time. Nzehñi in Otomi language, Imbomáani in Matlatzinca language, Zúmi in Mazahua language and Tsindijets in Tlahuica language. ==History== The first human settlements on these lands date back to 1,200 BC, according to information provided by the Museum of Anthropology and History, located in the Ex-Hacienda La Pila, in San Buenaventura. ==Geography== The Lerma River flows from Lake Almoloya del Río through the center of the municipality towards the west, flowing into Lake Chapala. From this point westward the river takes the name of Río Grande de Santiago in Jalisco. The river is about long; about 60% of it is known as Lerma River and 40% as Santiago River. The Nevado de Toluca or Xinantécatl is southwest of the city. The god Tolo was supposed to reside in the volcano's crater. Its original indigenous name was Chiknauhtekatl which means \"Nine Mountains\" but later was named Xinantecatl which means \"naked man\", because the silhouette of its crater resembles a sleeping man, before the Spaniards named it Nevado, meaning \"snow-covered\". It is a place of increasing sporting activity, such as mountain biking, climbing, and high altitude running. Zopilocalco hill is in Toluca City, near of Martíres Main Plaza. ===Climate=== The climate in Toluca is prone to extended dry periods particularly in the winter. Almost nine-tenths of the annual rainfall occurs between June and September. Just outside the heavily industrialized city, the municipality has forests with oak, pine, fir, cedar, cypress and other flora, characteristic of the temperate zone of central Mexico. ==Twin towns== Toluca is twin town with: * Caparroso, Spain * Cartago, Costa Rica * Debrecen, Hungary * Fort Worth, United States * Nanchang, China * Novi Sad, Serbia * Ramallah and al-Bireh, Palestine * Saitama, Japan * Suwon, South Korea * La Vega, Dominican Republic ==Related pages== * Toluca Municipality ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Municipality seats in Mexico (state) Category:1520s establishments in Mexico Category:1522 establishments",
