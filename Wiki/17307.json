 "text": "English people refer to people who are citizens of England or of English descent. England is one of the nations that is a part of the Island of Great Britain. It shares the island with Scotland (Scots) and Wales (the Welsh). England is also a part of the United Kingdom along with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Because of this, English people are also British people. English white people descended from Anglo-Saxons from Northern and Western Europe and Celts from Southern Europe. Non-white English people often have ancestors from many different countries. Often, their ancestors came from other European countries and from the rest of the world. Many people leave England to live in former British colonies. These include the United States, Australia and Canada. The countries with the most English people, other than the United Kingdom are the United States, Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand. == Citizenship == Citizenship refers to the United Kingdom rather than just England. Many citizens in the U.K. are not ethnically white. In the past, the British Empire controlled countries all over the world. People from many of these countries moved to England and had families. Over time, this led to many citizens from different ethnic groups. Examples of these groups include Indian people and other groups from the Indian subcontinent, people from African countries, people from the Caribbean islands and people from Hong Kong. Emigration from Britain is even more significant. About 40 to 44 million people in other countries have British ancestors. Census data provide the evidence for these statements. \"English Emigration\". Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk. Archived from the original on 8 April 2014.
