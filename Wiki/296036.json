 "text": "The Gnetophytes are a group of seed plants with three genera. Their evolutionary relationships are unclear, but it is now clear that they are related to each other. The three genera are: * Gnetum * Welwitschia * Ephedra By looking at the structure of these organisms (morphology) and the DNA (molecular taxonomy), scientists have found that Gnetum and Welwitschia are more closely related to each other than to Ephedra. == References == Category:Gymnosperms",
