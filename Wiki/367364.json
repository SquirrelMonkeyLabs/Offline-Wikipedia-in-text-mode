 "text": "Ngarutjaranya, also known as Mount Woodroffe, is South Australia's highest peak. It is above sea level. The word Ngarutjaranya comes from the Pitjantjatjara language. In their Dreaming, the mountain represents the spirit being Ngintaka. Ngarutjaranya is in the far northwest of South Australia, in the Musgrave Ranges. The mountain range rises about 700â€“800 metres above the plains around it. The rock is mostly granite and gneiss. Ngarutjaranya was given its European name by William Gosse, who first saw it on 20 July 1873. He named it after George Woodroffe Goyder, another early explorer of South Australia and the Northern Territory. Access to the mountain is restricted. Permission is needed to enter the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands. == References == Category:Mountains of South Australia",
