This region on the Pacific Coast is the most famous of several that have sought to adopt the name of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. This chosen for the words penned by the same man in the Declaration of Independence which reads that there is a “social contract” between the government and the people. The Jefferson movement believes that this social contract has been broken by Oregon and California. This region makes up most of Northern California's land but does not include San Francisco or other Bay Area counties that account for the majority of Northern California's population. It also takes up a good amount of Southern Oregon’s land and population as well. If the proposal were ever approved, the new state's capital city would have to be determined by a constitutional convention. Yreka, California, was named the provisional capital in the original 1941 proposal.Peter Laufer, The Elusive State of Jefferson: A Journey Through the 51st State. TwoDot, 2013. .
