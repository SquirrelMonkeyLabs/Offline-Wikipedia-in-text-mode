 "text": "Pro-choice is the view that a woman should have the right to decide whether or not to have an abortion and that there should not be laws that stop people from getting abortions. People who are pro-choice believe that people should be able to use abortion to end a pregnancy. The view that abortion should be against the law is called pro-life. The pro-choice movement is sometimes called the abortion rights movement. It is largely based on the belief, that woman should be able to decide what they want to do with their bodies. Having a baby would be a huge invasion to the body and should be a choice. They believe that an unborn embryo should not be valued over the pregnant woman. Pro-choice believes in a woman's right to choose. ==Related pages== *Abortion debate *Anti-abortion movement *My body, my choice Category:Social movements related to abortion",
