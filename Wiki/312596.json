Legend says that the two men were Daniel Boone and Henry Clay. Above their heads says \"United We Stand\". By their toes says \"Divided We Fall\". The phrase \"United We Stand, Divided We Fall\" is Kentucky's motto. ==References== ==Other websites== *Kentucky's State Flag Kentucky Category:Kentucky Category:Blue flags",
