The invasion led to a widespread boycott of Russia and Belarus in entertainment, media, business, and sport. U.S. President Joe Biden said there would be sanctions on banks VEB.RF and Promsvyazbank. On 24 February, the Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison said there would be travel bans. There would also be financial sanctions against eight members of Russia's national security council. The United Kingdom, United Nations, France, Germany, Spain, Japan, Sweden, Turkey, Norway, Canada, and Italy have also disagreed with the invasion. On 24 February 2022, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said the group has allowed \"massive\" actions that would target technological transfers, Russian banks and Russian assets. That same day, President Putin said Western countries that take part in the actions \"will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me\". On 26 February, the European Union, the United States and their allies say that they support in removing Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system. The next day, many European nations announced a ban on Russian flights in their airspace. On 28 February, Switzerland, Monaco, Singapore, and South Korea put in place economic sanctions on Russia such as controlling exports and assets.
