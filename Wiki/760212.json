He is a parody of James Bond villains, mainly Ernst Stavro Blofeld (as played by Donald Pleasence). Dr. Evil wants to terrorize and take over the world. His sidekick Mini-Me, is a dwarf clone of himself. Myers revived the character for three occassions: a brief appearance on the December 20, 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in a sketch where Dr. Evil has been fired from President Trump's cabinet, and a General Motors 2022 Super Bowl ad, \"EVil Is Back For Good\". ==References== Category:Austin Powers characters Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1997 Category:Fictional twins Category:Movie villains",
