 "text": "In Japan, road signs (道路標識, dōro-hyōshiki) are standardized by the \"Order on Road Sign, Road Line, and Road Surface Marking (道路標識、区画線及び道路標示に関する命令)\" established in 1968 with origins from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's \"Order on Standardization of Road Sign\" of 1934 and the Home Ministry of Japan's \"Order on Road Signs\" of 1942. The previous designs have been used since 1986 after several amendments of order. ==History== The first standardised road signage schemes appeared in 1922. At first, two types of signs were established: \"road warning signs\" equivalent to warning signs and \"road guide signs\" as information signs. Warning signs at that time closely resembled the British design as used in Hong Kong, the only difference was the white-on-black lettering. Japanese road signs in the early 1940s closely followed European road signage practices at that time based on the 1931 Geneva Convention, except that most road signages contained text. A variation of the early 1940s Japanese road signage system is still in use today in Taiwan. In 1950, a complete revision of the \"Road Signs Ordinance\" was promulgated and enforced as an Ordinance of the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Construction. Unlike the 1922 and the 1940s devised road signs, it included both bilingual Japanese and English text and symbols. Warning signs were changed from a European red-bordered triangular design to an American MUTCD yellow diamond design. This road signage system was used until 1963, when it was replaced with a new road signage system that is based on the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. The present-day Japanese road signage system also replaced the stop sign's shape with an inverted equilateral triangle like the stop sign used in West Germany from the 1945 to 1971. In 2016, it was announced that the Japanese National Police Agency was considering changing the design of the \"Stop\" sign used on Japanese roads since 1963 from the inverted red triangle sign to an octagonal design more closely conforming to the recommendations of the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. The inverted red triangle sign was introduced in 1963 ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games, and replaced the earlier red octagonal sign used from 1960, which in turn had replaced the yellow octagonal sign used from 1950. It was later decided to make the stop sign bilingual in both Japanese and English, but to maintain the inverted triangular shape. ==Warning signs== File:Japan road sign 201-A.svg|Crossroads File:Japan road sign 201-B-R.svg|T-intersection with road on the right File:Japan road sign 201-B-L.svg|T-intersection with road on the left File:Japan road sign 201-C.svg|T-junction File:Japan road sign 201-D.svg|Y-junction File:Japan road sign 201-2.svg|Roundabout ahead File:Japan road sign 202-R.svg|Gentle curve to the right File:Japan road sign 202-L.svg|Gentle curve to the left File:Japan road sign 203-R.svg|Sharp curve to the right File:Japan road sign 203-L.svg|Sharp curve to the left File:Japan road sign 204-R.svg|Double gentle curve, first to the right File:Japan road sign 204-L.svg|Double gentle curve, first to the left File:Japan road sign 205-R.svg|Double sharp curve, first to the right File:Japan road sign 205-L.svg|Double sharp curve, first to the left File:Japan road sign 206-R.svg|Winding road, first curve to the right File:Japan road sign 206-L.svg|Winding road, first curve to the left File:Japan road sign 207-A.svg|Railroad crossing ahead Option 1: steam locomotive File:Japan road sign 207-B.svg|Railroad crossing ahead Option 2: electric train File:Japan road sign 208.svg|School ahead File:Japan road sign 208-2.svg|Traffic signals ahead File:Japan road sign 209.svg|Slippery road File:Japan road sign 209-2.svg|Fallen rocks File:Japan road sign 209-3.svg|Uneven surface File:Japan road sign 210.svg|Traffic merges from the left File:Japan road sign 211.svg|Left lane ends File:Japan road sign 212.svg|Road narrows on both sides File:Japan road sign 212-2.svg|Two-way traffic ahead File:Japan road sign 212-4.svg|Steep descent (10%, 1:10) File:Japan road sign 212-3.svg|Steep ascent (10%, 1:10) File:Japan road sign 213.svg|Men at works File:Japan road sign 214.svg|Crosswind File:Japan road sign 214-2.svg|Watch for large animals (deer) File:Japan road sign 214-2 Hare.svg|Watch for large animals (rabbit) File:Japan road sign 214-2 Monkey.svg|Watch for large animals (monkey) File:Japan road sign 214-2 Raccoon-dog.svg|Watch for large animals (raccoon dogs) File:Japan road sign 215.svg|Danger ==Regulatory signs== File:Japan road sign 301.svg|Road closed to all File:Japan road sign 302.svg|Road closed to vehicles File:Japan road sign 303.svg|No entry File:Japan road sign 304.svg|No motor vehicles except motorcycles and mopeds File:Japan road sign 305.svg|No trucks File:Japan road sign 306.svg|No buses File:Japan road sign 307.svg|No motorbike or mopeds File:Japan road sign 308.svg|No non-motorized vehicles except bicycles File:Japan road sign 309.svg|No bicycles File:Japan road sign 310.svg|No motor vehicles File:Japan road sign 310-2.svg|No two-person motorbike or mopeds File:Japan road sign 311-A-L.svg|Straight ahead or left turn permitted File:Japan road sign 311-A-R.svg|Straight ahead or right turn permitted File:Japan road sign 311-B-L.svg|Turn left File:Japan road sign 311-B-R.svg|Turn right File:Japan road sign 311-C.svg|No turns File:Japan road sign 311-D.svg|Turn left or right File:Japan road sign 311-E.svg|Directions permitted File:Japan road sign 311-F-L.svg|Keep left File:Japan road sign 311-F-R.svg|Keep right File:Japan road sign 312.svg|No crossing center line to enter e.g. a car park File:Japan road sign 313.svg|No U-turns File:Japan road sign 314.svg|No crossing center line to overtake File:Japan road sign 315.svg|No stopping File:Japan road sign 316.svg|No parking File:Japan road sign 318.svg|Restricted parking File:Japan road sign 319.svg|No vehicles carrying dangerous goods File:Japan road sign 320.svg|Weight limit File:Japan road sign 321.svg|Height limit File:Japan road sign 322.svg|Width limit File:Japan road sign 325.svg|Motor vehicles only File:Japan road sign 325-2.svg|Bicycles only File:Japan road sign 325-3.svg|Bicycles and pedestrians only File:Japan road sign 325-4.svg|Pedestrians only File:Japan road sign 323 (90).svg|Maximum speed limit File:Japan road sign 324 (50).svg|Minimum speed limit File:Japan road sign 326-A-L.svg|One-way street to the left File:Japan road sign 326-A-R.svg|One way street to the right File:Japan road sign 326-B.svg|One-way street ahead File:Japan road sign 326-2-A-L.svg|One way (bike) File:Japanese road sign 327-2.svg|Trucks use left laneThe symbol can be changed to other vehicles.
