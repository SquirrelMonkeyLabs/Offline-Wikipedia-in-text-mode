The West Bengal Police has joint authority with the twenty two revenue districts of the State as under the Police Act 1861. The other general police district consists of the major portions of the metropolitan area of Kolkata, and has a separate police force (Kolkata Police) administered under the Calcutta Police Act 1866 & Calcutta (Suburban Police) Act 1866.
