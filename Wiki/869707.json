 "text": "Lanmei Thanbi () or Langmei Thanbi () is a spirit that appeared in the form of a light flickering over the marshes in Meitei mythology and folklore of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). Legend says that it leads people to astray if it chases them. It is sometimes regarded as parallel to the Will o' the wisp, Jack-o'-lantern and Ignis Fatuus of the European folklore. In ancient times, people used to say: > \"Lanmei Thanbi toi toi! Hangen Poura kit!\" It is roughly translated as: > \"Come Lanmei Thanbi, come, if you dare. We will nab you with hangen (bamboo > skeleton used for stretching fishing nets) and poura (bamboo pole on which > hangen is attached or tied).\" ==Other websites== * Lanmei Thanbi (2008 film) ==References== Category:Meitei folklore Category:Meitei mythology",
