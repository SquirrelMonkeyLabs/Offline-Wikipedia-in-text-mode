Chowkur has two Tibetan settlements known as Rabtenling and Phuntsokling, which is also known as camp one and two. The settlement is named after a nearby place called Anna Chowkur. Government of Karnataka has provided housing facilities and field for cultivation to Tibetans with the help of other NGOs for the survival. During the early years, many of them survived with collecting woods from the nearby forest for cooking and slowly developed by owning gases. The history of Tibetan refugees settled in Chowkur itself is the history of its people as many does not know much about this remote settlement, not even other Tibetans. The history of Chowkur is recollection of memories of first-generation Tibetan refugee and official records. ==Population== The total population (2011) estimated is 700 number.

One can reach from Periyapatna bus stand. From Periyapatna, one must go by auto as Chowkur does not have bus facilities. It is 5 kms away from the nearest town, which is also a taluk of Chowkur.

But , in the past, the school has provided educational facilities to many Tibetan refugees so they can get further education. 2\\. Community hall The community hall was provided for both the camps to perform certain activities such as meeting, functions, occasions, and other social gatherings related to the camp. Since both the camps share common social and culture background with similar social status, all the activities and social gatherings are done together in one community hall. The hall gives access to general meetings or official meetings done by Indian Government and CTA. Thus, the community hall provides facilities to the residents to conduct religious and cultural celebrations such as celebrating His Holiness Dalai Lama birthday, Tibetan New Year, and other important occasions. therefore, community hall facility plays an important role in livelihood of Tibetan refugees to preserve their culture and religion. ==Climate and Cultivation== The average climate of Chowkur is Tropical Wet and Dry, which is favorable for its residents.
