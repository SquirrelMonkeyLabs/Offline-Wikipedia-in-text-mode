 "text": "The mahogany tree frog or loquacious tree frog (Tlalocohyla loquax) is a frog that lives in Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. This frog lives in places where there is water in the air. Scientists have seen it 1000 meters above sea level and below. The adult male frog is 33 to 45 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 38 to 47 mm long. This frog has bright yellow color on its back. It has bright red near its rear end and sides. This frog can change color. It shows its yellow and orange at night. During the day, it is almost white. This frog looks for food at night. The front feet and back feet have webbing on them. This frog lays eggs in deep bodies of water. The female lays about 250 eggs at a time. The eggs stick to plants on the surface. After the tadpoles hatch, they swim to the deepest water. This frog is not in danger of dying out because it can live in many places where the water is deep so long as there are some plants. Many of the places where the frog lives are in protected areas where the government does not allow humans to build things. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
