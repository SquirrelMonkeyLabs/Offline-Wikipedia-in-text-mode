At least 100,000 galaxies and clusters are in it. The diameter of Laneikea SC is over 160 mega-parsecs (520 million light-years) == Backround == It was discovered in September 2014, when a group of astronomers at the universities published a new method of defining superclusters. The new definition of the local supercluster containes the Virgo and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster. The former being the defined local supercluster. == Structure == The Laniakea Supercluster contains: * Virgo Supercluster, the supercluster where the Milky Way is located * Hydra- Centaurus Supercluster **the Great Attractor **Antlia Wall, known as Hydra Supercluster **Pavo-Indus Supercluster **Southern Supercluster with Fornax Cluster, Dorado and Eridinarus clusters. The Laneikea Supercluster is a part of the Piscesâ€“Cetus Supercluster Complex Category:Laniakea Supercluster",
