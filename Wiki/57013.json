 "text": "A hovercraft is a vehicle supported and moved by a cushion of air blowing downwards. They are used on water, land, ice and other areas where the surface is smooth. A difference in air pressure between the ship and the atmosphere creates lift, causing the hovercraft to float above the surface it is set on, allowing it to ride on different surfaces. They are often used as ferries and by militaries for amphibious, or on water and on land (like an amphibian can live in water and land) missions. A hovercraft can move cargo, people, and cars. The English engineer Sir Christopher Cockerell invented the modern hovercraft. == References == Category:Alternative propulsion Category:Vehicles",
