It is a railway border crossing between Slovakia and Ukraine. == History == The town only started to grow after 1946, when the new Czechoslovak-Soviet border was formed. At that time, it became Slovakia’s largest railway border crossing. In 1968, Alexander Dubček, the leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, met Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet Communist Party leader, in a train carriage here. This happened just before the Soviet “help” in August, which was the crushing of the Prague Spring. Because of its fast growth, the settlement was given town status in 1969. == Population == In 2021, 1843 of its 3586 inhabitants were Hungarian, 1352 Slovak, 15 Ukrainian, 12 Gypsy, 8 Albanian, 6 Czech, 6 Vietnamese, 3 Rusyn, 1 Russian, 1 Croatian, 339 of unknown nationality. == Notes == == Other websites == * Čierna nad Tisou's website * e-obce.sk Category:Towns in Slovakia Category:Košice Region",
