The character is depicted as a well-educated man who has tired of civilization and returns to the jungle where he was raised. The show kept many of the elements of the classic movie series, such as \"Cheeta\". Other elements, such as \"Jane\", were dropped. This is because the producer Sy Weintraub wanted a \"new look\" for the story. CBS aired reruns during the summer of 1969. Category:1960s television series Category:Tarzan",
