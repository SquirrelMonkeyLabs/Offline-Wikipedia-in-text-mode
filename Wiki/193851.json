 "text": "The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference is a political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. == Overview == In 1932 Pro-Congress Sheikh Abdullah formed Kashmir's first political party, in Srinagar, the All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, with a demand for merger of Kashmir and Jammu with British India. His party was renamed the National Conference in 1939 to suite the secular nature of Kashmiri culture. The All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, led by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, had a secular ideology and wished to create a secular, democratic but independent Kashmir with close ties to British India. When the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was converted into a secular political party in 1939, the Muslim leaders amended the Constitution of the Muslim Conference, renamed it the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, modified its objectives and opened its membership to all the people of the State. On 13 June 1941, the breakaway factions of the National Conference revived the Muslim Conference under the leadership of Choudry Ghualm Abbas. The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference led the Muslim movement for accession into Pakistan. On July 19, 1947, a convention of All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, adopted the \"Accession to Pakistan Resolution\" demanding accession of the Kashmir state to Pakistan. Since 1948 the All-Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference has been the political party in power in Jammu and Kashmir. == Presidents of All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference == #Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah (deceased) #Rais-ul-Ahrar Quaid e Millat Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas (deceased) #Syed Aziz Badshah of Khanyara Sharif Dadyal #Agha Syed Hussain Shah Jalali (deceased) #Mir Waiz Kashmir Muhammad Yousuf Shah (deceased) #Sardar Mohammad Abdul Qayyum Khan #Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (deceased) #Raja Muhammad Haider Khan (deceased) #Sardar Sikandar Hayat Khan #Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan ==References== Category:Political parties in Kashmir",
