 "text": "Tobias \"Toby\" Sheldon (born Tobias Strebel; October 3, 1980 â€“ August 21, 2015) was a German songwriter who became a television reality star noted for having paid considerable amounts for plastic surgery (he himself estimated the total cost at over $100,000) in order to resemble singer Justin Bieber. He appeared on the television shows Botched on the E! network and My Strange Addiction on TLC. Some experts argued that Sheldon's obsession was a case of body dysmorphia. This topic was discussed in depth during his appearance alongside Justin Jedlica (\"The Human Ken Doll\") on the talk show Bethenny. On August 21, 2015 Sheldon was found dead in a room at a Motel 6 in the San Fernando Valley. Drugs were reportedly discovered at the scene. Sheldon was 34. He had last been seen in West Hollywood on August 18, 2015 and some reports have indicated that his disappearance may have been triggered by a break-up with his boyfriend. In July 2016, a coroner confirmed his death was triggered from multiple drug intoxication. == References == Category:1980 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:German songwriters Category:People from Nuremberg Category:Drug-related deaths in the United States Category:German LGBT people Category:LGBT musicians Category:Surgery",
