 "text": "A bedbug (or bed bug) is a small, elusive, parasitic insect of the family Cimicidae. They live by feeding on the blood of humans and other warm-blooded animals. The name 'bed bug' is used as the bug likes to live in houses, and especially in beds or other areas where people may sleep. Bedbugs are mainly active at night and can feed without people noticing. They leave a small itchy bite, like a mosquito. ==References== Category:Hemiptera",
