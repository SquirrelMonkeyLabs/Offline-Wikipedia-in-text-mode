 "text": "The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the international body for contract bridge. The WBF is responsible for world championship competition, most of which is on a four-year cycle. The top championships are those for national teams in Open, Women, and Seniors categories. There is a World Team Olympiad every four years. The World Bridge Federation was founded August 1958 by delegates from Europe, North America, and South America (now Zones 1 to 3). Each national organisation is in one of the eight geographic zones. It is incorporated under the laws of Switzerland as a 'non-profit' organization. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt was made the first honorary member of the WBF for his work developing the game. == References == Category:Bridge federations Category:1958 establishments",
