 "text": "Hotel Timor is in the center of Dili, the capital of East Timor. It is one of the oldest hotels in the city. ==History== The current business is on the old site of Hotel Mahkota, built by Lay San Ying and Stanley Ho. It opened in 1976 and ran until September 1999. During that time, many foreign journalists stayed there to cover conflicts in the country. The hotel was attacked and burned down by pro-Indonesian militias. To provide good accommodation for state guests during East Timor's independence celebrations in 2002, the hotel was restored. Fundação Oriente and the East Timor government paid $6 million for the work. Notable guests included Lula da Silva, Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton, Ban Ki-moon, António Guterres, Mahathir Mohamad, John Howard, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown. ==References== Category:Dili Category:Hotels Category:Buildings and structures in Asia",
