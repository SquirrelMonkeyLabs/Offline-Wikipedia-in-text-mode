 "text": "The Italian Grand Prix (Gran Premio d'Italia) is one of the longest running motor racing events. The first Italian Grand Prix motor racing championship was on September 4, 1921 at Brescia. Now the race is run at the Monza track instead. This track was built in 1922 and was used for almost all other races from then on. The Italian Grand Prix counted toward the European Championship from 1935 to 1938. The Italian Grand Prix was one of the first Formula One championship races in 1950. It and has been held every year since then. The only other championship race like this is the British Grand Prix. After winning the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher announced his retirement from Formula 1. It was the end of the 2006 season. Kimi Räikkönen took over from him at Ferrari for the 2007 season. == Winners of the Italian Grand Prix == === Multiple winners (drivers) === Drivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.
