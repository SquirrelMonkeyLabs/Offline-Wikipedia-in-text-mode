 "text": "The Raider Command also known as Rangers, National Guard Special Forces is a Special Forces and Special Operations Force within the Cypriot National Guard. It is based in Larnaca, Cyprus. == Mission == The main mission is guerrilla warfighting. After its creation in the 1960s, it began training in the Troodos Mountains. It began operations against Turkish armed people (Mainly TMT) and elements of Turkish special forces which were operating on the island.Μαριος Αδαμου, Δεκαετια εν Οπλοις 1964-1974, Αμμοχωστος, Cypriot Institute of Scientific and Historic Research Until the invasion in 1974, this was its most important mission. Since then, the unit has changed to fit the condition of the geostrategic location of Cyprus. The modern threats facing the country include the war on terror and the threat created by Turkey. Today LOKs missions can be from Mountain/ Border Patrols, to Combat Search and Rescue. It can do Direct Action missions and paratrooping operations. It also focuses in hostage Rescue and fighting in close range to the enemy. == History == === Insignia/Uniform === All members wear the unit written sign/symbol showing a winged sword, which shows of the \"deadly, silent and fast\" nature of special forces operations. A scroll runs across the sword and wings with the saying \"Who Dares Wins\", a message of thanks to the Free Greek Special Forces that served with the 1st Special Air Service during World War II. The unit flash is marked with Raider Forces. All Raiders wear the green beret with the Greek national emblem on the left. === Crises of the 1960s === Immediately after its beginning in 1964, the Commando Battalions were put into action to fight against both Turkish terrorist organisations and the Turkish Armed Forces. It played an important role in both the Battles of Tylliria which happened in August 1964 and in Kofinou in 1967. In the Battle of Tillyria, LOK was responsible for clearing villages and taking on any Turkish resistance in the area. It lost its first 3 Commandos who were killed in the fighting. During Operation Kofinou, LOKs job was to at first clear the hills of any Turkish fighters. It was later given the job of clearing the village of any resistance left in the area. For this operation, both the 31st and the 32nd Commando Battalions took part whilst also helping the armored division and Cyprus Police. 1 Commando was killed during the successful operation. === 1970s === ==== Turkish invasion of Cyprus ==== Throughout the Turkish invasion, LOK played a role in preventing the Turkish military from moving any further. It defended the Nicosia International Airport taking key points such as areas of the Pentadaktylos mountains. It cut off key routes such as those seen in Operation Lavida. In the first phase of the invasion, the Raiders Command put into plan Operation Lavida, which was a plan to cut off/disturb the Kyrenia-Kionelli enclave from getting more support from the invading army. It was a nighttime operation beginning at about 11PM and was planned into the following: * The 31st Raider Company was in charge of taking over Hill Kotza-Kayia. * The 32nd Raider Company was in charge of taking over Hill Aspri Moutti * The 33rd Raider Company was in charge of taking over Hill Petromouthia * The 34th Raider Company was in charge of taking over Hill 296 near Agirda https://www.militaire.gr/%CE%BA%CF%85%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83-1974-%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%B9%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%81%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B1/ https://www.smashpoint.gr/guest-hour/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%82-%CE%BA%CF%8D%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82-1974/ ==== Egyptian Raid on Larnaka Airport ==== In the late 1970s, after the murder of a an Egyptian, Yusuf Sibai, the PFLPs hijacked a Cyprus Airways DC-8. The task of the Commandos units was to (if necessary) take out the hijackers. They ended up having to take on members of Egyptian Special Forces who tried doing a rescue operation, without authorisation from the Cypriot Government. The Commandos of the 32nd Commando Battalion successfully stopped the Egyptian attack.http://www.psek.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=70&Itemid;=76 == Joining and Training in Cypriot Army Special Forces == === Training at LOK === In the Cypriot Army Special Forces, they train mostly like their brothers in Greece (As they refer to as their mother unit, LOK).
