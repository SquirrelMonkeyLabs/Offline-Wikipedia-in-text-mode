 "text": "Syed Makhdoom Yousaf Raza Gillani (, born 9 June 1952 in Karachi) was the 16th Prime Minister of Pakistan. He was a former Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan (1993-1997) and former Federal Minister (1985-1986). He was nominated by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), with the support of coalition partners, Pakistan Muslim League (N), Awami National Party, Jamiat Ulema-e- Islam (F) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement on 22 March 2008. He took the oath of office from President Pervez Musharraf on 25 March 2008. Gilani is the first elected Prime Minister of Pakistan from the Seraiki-speaking belt, a much- neglected area politically. Gilani is also the present vice chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party. On 26 April 2012 Gillani was discharged from the prime ministership due to white-collar crime charges. On 19 June 2012, the supreme court of Pakistan finally ousted Gillani from the premiership due to charges of corruption. He was replaced by Raja Pervez Ashraf because the first candidate Makhdoom Shahabuddin was arrested on alleged drug trafficking, in collaboration with Gillani's son. The hearing of cases against Gillani are going on at this time. == References == Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Pakistani criminals Category:Pakistani Muslims Category:Prime ministers of Pakistan Category:Speakers of the National Assembly of Pakistan Category:Politicians from Karachi",
