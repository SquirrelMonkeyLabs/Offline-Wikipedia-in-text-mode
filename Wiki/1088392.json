 "text": "Ohmdenia is an extinct genus of pachycormiform from the Lower Jurassic of Germany. Its only species is O. multidentata. Some studies say Ohmdenia is a synonym of Saurostomus. == Description == The fish is only known from an incomplete fossil, but it is good enough proof to know what it looked like. Ohmdenia was a large animal, averaging two and a half meters long. The body is long and thick. It had a wide mouth and a long and short skull. == Taxonomy == Ohmdenia is a member of the family Pachycormidae in the order Pachycormiformes. For a long time, Ohmdenia was considered a close relative of Birgeria, a famous Triassic predator. Further studies show that this is not the case, so they placed it in the extinct order Pachycormiformes. == Related pages == * Hypsocormus * Mamulichthys * Saurostomus * Balistomorphus * Bobasatrania * Australosomus * Allothrissops * Allomorone * Asialepidotus * Orthocormus == References == # Hauff, B.
