 "text": "The iMac G4 is an all-in-one personal computer developed and made by Apple Computer. It was released on January 2002. It was discontinued on August 2004. It has a hemispheric base that has the computer parts, including the PowerPC G4 processor, and a flatscreen liquid-crystal display (LCD) mounted above. The screen is connected to the base by an adjustable arm. The arm let the monitor be moved. Apple's previous release, the iMac G3 (1998), was sold a lot. This was at time when the company was close to bankruptcy. As prices fell for computer parts, Apple thought up a replacement that would use an LCD instead of the G3's big cathode-ray tube. The iMac G4 took two years to develop. The new shape was inspired by a sunflower. It was announced at the Macworld San Francisco trade show on January 7, 2002. It began shipping that month. It was updated over the years with faster internal parts and larger LCDs. The iMac G4 was well liked by critics and sold a lot. Apple sold more than 1.3 million units in its first year and about 3.1 million units alongside the eMac in its lifetime. The iMac G5 came after it in 2004. iMac G5 replaced the G4's bold design language with a more conservative look that influenced later iMac models. == References == Category:Apple products",
