 "text": "The central coastal plain of Vietnam stretches from Thanh Hóa Province in the north to Bình Thuận Province in the south. This region is characterized by diverse topography, including coastal plains, dunes, and narrow valleys. It is divided into two sub-regions: North Central Coast and South Central Coast. The area's geography and proximity to the equator contribute to its distinct climates and weather patterns. == Geography == === Topography === The plains are formed through sedimentation and erosion processes over millennia. They consist of terraces that descend in elevation from inland areas to the sea. Coastal dunes and sandbanks are prominent, with some areas, such as Bàu Tró in Quảng Bình Province, featuring underground freshwater reserves. Mountain ranges, like the Hoành Sơn Range and Hải Vân Pass, cut through the plains and extend into the ocean, creating a fragmented landscape. === Key features === * Coastal Plains: These are fertile, narrow areas suitable for agriculture, often flanked by sand dunes or rocky terrains. * Dunes and Lagoons: The plains include sand dunes up to 40-50 meters high and lagoons, such as Phá Tam Giang, which support aquaculture and biodiversity. == Climate and weather == The region experiences two distinct climatic influences: * North Central Coast: Receives cool winds from the northeast monsoon. * South Central Coast: Influenced by dry and hot southwestern winds, often referred to as Laos Winds.Ở Việt Nam gọi là gió Lào thì ở Lào gọi là gió gì? The region is prone to tropical storms and typhoons during monsoon seasons, causing significant impacts on local communities. == Economic activities == * Agriculture: The fertile plains support rice cultivation and other crops. However, limited arable land due to sand encroachment is a challenge in some areas. * Fisheries and aquaculture: Coastal waters and lagoons contribute significantly to the local economy, supporting fisheries and seafood farming. * Tourism: Beaches like Mũi Né in Bình Thuận and historical sites in Đà Nẵng attract tourists, boosting the service sector. == Historical and cultural significance == The region played a vital role in Vietnamese history as a frontier zone during the southward expansion (Nam Tiến). Today, its cultural heritage includes Cham architecture and traditional coastal fishing practices. == References == Category:Geography of Vietnam",
