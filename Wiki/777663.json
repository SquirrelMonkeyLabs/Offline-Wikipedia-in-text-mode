 "text": "Arameans, also known as Syriacs or Native Syrians, are a Christian ethnoreligious group whose origins remain in what is today Iraq, Turkey and Syria. The majority of Arameans have fled to Western Europe, North America and Northern Europe due to persecution over the past centuries. The Arameans speak Aramaic which once was the language of the whole Middle East and was also the native language of Jesus. Their culture has survived for thousands of years despite efforts by their Arab, Turkish and Kurdish neighbours to demolish it: it remains a strong influence on their way of life. Today there are about 3-5 million Arameans worldwide with the majority living in the diaspora. ==References== Category:Ethnic groups",
