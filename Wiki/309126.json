 "text": "Bonsai Kitten was a satirical website which claimed that you could make a \"shaped\" cat by putting a kitten in a jar and letting it grow into the shape of the jar. It was named after bonsai, a Japanese art in which trees are shaped. The site was made by a university student with the nickname \"Dr. Michael Wong Chang\". The site claimed that many different shapes and \"containment vessels\" are possible, including a cube, a sphere, a wire cage, and even a Klein bottle. Supposedly, the kittens are force-fed through a tube, and the kitten's anus is sealed with super glue. == Other websites == * Bonsai Kitten (archived) Category:American websites Category:Shock sites Category:Hoaxes",
