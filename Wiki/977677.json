Echo it over and over again. Remember, through my joy, each martyr. Clothe her with the shining mantles of our festivals. ùÑÜ O World, my song. ùÑá My unity, my unity O marvellous song which fills my heart, You are the promise of all to come, My banner, my banner O cloth nailed from every sun Raised forever, on every peak My nation, my nation give me strength, o source of strength And save me for you, the best of nations. In faith and love I am part of mankind, And I shall march first among the Arabs. And my heart beat shall remain that of a Yemenite. No foreigner shall ever hold dominion over Yemen. ==References== Yem Category:National symbols of Yemen",
