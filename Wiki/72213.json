Greek and Aramaic influences have been shown, but some Georgian scholars like Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze have said that they were freely invented in imitation of the Greek model rather than directly based upon earlier forms of the Aramaic alphabet even though the Georgian phonological inventory is very different from Greek. == Other websites == * Georgian Website / Portal with info on Georgian culture and language * Direct transliteration Latin â†” Georgian * Georgian fonts, compliant with Unicode 4.0, also available for MAC OS 9 or X Category:Georgia (country) Category:Alphabets",
