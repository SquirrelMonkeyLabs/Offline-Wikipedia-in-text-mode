 "text": "A hypnotic is a drug designed to help you sleep. It is a type of psychoactive drug which acts as a soporific, and is also used for surgical anaesthesia. Many hypnotics are addictive, and have side-effects. Because of this, most are prescribed as a last resort, and only for a short time. Rohypnol is a particularly powerful example of a hypnotic. \"Nonbenzodiazepines are a relatively newer class of hypnotics. Also known as the [ Z drugs or] “Z” drugs, this class includes zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon, and eszopiclone\", according to media.https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/z-drug.
