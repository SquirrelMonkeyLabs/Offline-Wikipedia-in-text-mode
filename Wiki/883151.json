 "text": "Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district in Wisconsin. It has been represented by Democrat Ron Kind since 1997. It is located in western Wisconsin, along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border. The district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+4, meaning it is roughly four points more conservative than the country. It is one of just seven districts to support Donald Trump in 2020 but also elect a representative from the Democratic Party. == Political characteristics == This district used to favor the Democrats, but has recently begun favoring Republicans slightly. This can be seen by Representative Kind's decreasing margins in recent years: he won 56.5% in 2014, 99.9% in 2016 (he had no opponent), and 59.7% in 2018 - all high percentages - but just 51.3% in 2020, a very narrow victory. The district has also gone from supporting Democrat Barack Obama in 2012, 55-44%, to supporting Republican Donald Trump 49-44% in 2016 and 52-47% in 2020, and the Cook PVI went from even (meaning it was as competitive as the country) to R+4 (meaning it was conservative-leaning). With popular Representative Kind having announced his retirement, some think the district will elect a Republican representative in 2022 for the first time in the 21st century. == References == 03",
