 "text": "An oscilloscope (sometimes abbreviated CRO, for cathode ray oscilloscope, or commonly just scope or O-scope) is a piece of electronic equipment that lets you see changes or waveform in signal voltage. For example, if you want to see the signal a small electronic timer was producing, you could connect it to an oscilloscope and see. Usually, it shows a two-dimensional graph of one or more electrical potential differences on the vertical axis. These graphs are plotted with time or some other voltage along horizontal axis. == Description == A typical oscilloscope is usually box shaped with a display screen, numerous input connectors, control knobs and buttons on the front panel. To aid measurement, a grid called the graticule is drawn on the face of the screen. Each square in the graticule is known as a division. == Other websites == * Oscillograph 1911 Encyclop√¶dia. * Online oscilloscope simulation * Oscilloscope Tutorial * The Cathode Ray Tube site * Digital Storage Oscilloscope measurement basics * Oscilloscope FAQ * Oscilloscope Articles & Resources * Using a Common Oscilloscope * Features of handheld Oscilloscope * Quick and easy tutorial to learn concepts and use.
