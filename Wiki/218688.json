 "text": "In group theory, an abelian group is a group with operation that is commutative. Because of that, an abelian group is sometimes called a ‘commutative group’. A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a ‘non-abelian group’ or ‘non-commutative group’. == Definition == An abelian group is a set, A, together with an operation \"•\". It combines any two elements a and b to form another element denoted . For the group to be abelian, the operation and the elements must follow some requirements. These are known as the abelian group axioms: ;Closure: For all a, b in A, the result of the operation a • b is also in A. ;Associativity: For all a, b and c in A, the equation (a • b) • c = a • (b • c) is true. ;Identity element: There exists an element e in A, such that for all elements a in A, the equation holds. ;Inverse element: For each a in A, there exists an element b in A such that a • b = b • a = e, where e is the identity element. ;Commutativity: For all a, b in A, a • b = b • a. == Examples == One example of an abelian group is the set of the integers with the operation of addition. We often write this as (\\mathbb{Z}, +), where \\mathbb{Z} means the set of all integers. This is an abelian group because (\\mathbb{Z}, +) is a group, and also for any integers a and b, the equation a+b = b+a is true. For example, 3 + 6 = 6 + 3, because both sides are equal to 9.
