It aims to implement the ecosocialist programme L'Avenir en commun (English: \"A Shared Future\"). The party nominated Mélenchon as its candidate for the presidential election of 2017. He came fourth in the first round, receiving 19.6% of the vote and failing to qualify for the second round by around 2%. After the legislative election of 2017, La France Insoumise formed a parliamentary group of 17 members of the National Assembly, with Mélenchon as the group's president. In the 2019 European Parliament election, it however only won six seats, below its expectations. The party uses the lower case Greek letter phi as its logotype.
