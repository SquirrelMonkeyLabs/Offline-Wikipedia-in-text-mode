 "text": "The Travancore bush frog, Travancore tree frog, or Travancore bubble-nest frog (Raorchestes travancoricus) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat area. ==Home== People have seen this frog on small, woody plants near farms, for example tea farms. They have also seen this frog in some tropical forests. Sometimes this frog sits on dead leaves on the ground. It also lives in a special grassy place called a vayal. People have seen this frog between 350 and 1802 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== This frog can be 31 mm long from nose to rear end. Scientists believe that young frogs hatch out of eggs. They believe this frog is never a tadpole. ==Dangers== This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in a small place and because human beings change the places where the frogs live. Humans cut down forests to build farms and cities and to get wood to build with. Many humans take a religious trip to the Western Ghats and disturb this frog. Scientists think climate change could also hurt this frog: Because it lives high in the hills, it cannot move to a colder place if its home becomes too hot. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Periyar Tiger Reserve. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can also make this frog sick. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
