He was also known as the \"British Schindler\". The transports lasted almost five (5) months, in total. He was never awarded Righteous Among The Nations by the Yad Vashem, because he never risked his lives to save the Jews, which would actually be against one of the policies required by the Yad Vashem in Israel. For all of his actions and responsibilities, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, for his service, in the year, 2003. Winton was born in Hampstead, London, England. His parents were German Jews. The family later became Christians and Winton was baptised. In 1923, he began studying at Stowe School. He married Grete Gjelstrup, a woman of Danish origin, in 1948.
