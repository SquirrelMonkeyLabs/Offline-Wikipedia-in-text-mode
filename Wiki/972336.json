 "text": "Blue-footed boobies are seabirds known for their sky blue feet. Their feet have a kind of web in between their toes. Blue footed boobies use their bright blue feet to attract potential mates, and display overall health and fertility. Once a mate has been selected, they will use their feet to put on a courtship display. â€œMales and females have colorful feet that are displayed ostentatiously during courtship, both before and after pairing, and extrapair copulations are frequent.(Torres, Velando. 2004) == References == Category:Suliformes Category:Seabirds",
