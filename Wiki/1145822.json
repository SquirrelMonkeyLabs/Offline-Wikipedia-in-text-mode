 "text": "The United States Space Command (USSPACECOM or SPACECOM) is a part of the United States Department of Defense. It oversees all military activities in outer space. The starting boundary of this area is set at 100 kilometers or 62 miles above sea level. Space Command was first established in 1985 to oversee all military forces in space and to operate in cooperation with other military commands. It was shut down in 2002, and its duties were moved to another group, the United States Strategic Command. It was restarted on August 29, 2019. The U.S. Space Force is the main group that supplies most of the people and equipment for U.S. Space Command. Other military branches also provide some help. == References == Category:1985 establishments in the United States Category:United States Department of Defense",
