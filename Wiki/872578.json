 "text": "Xiaolin Showdown is an American animated television series that aired on Kids' WB and was created by Christy Hui. Set in a world where martial arts battles and Eastern magic are commonplace, the series follows four young Xiaolin warriors in training who battle the Heylin forces of evil. They do this by protecting Shen Gong Wu (ancient artifacts that have great magical powers) from villains that would use them to conquer the world. Typical episodes revolve around a specific Shen Gong Wu being revealed which results in both sides racing to find it. Episodes usually reach a head when one good and one evil character must challenge each other to a magical duel called a Xiaolin Showdown for possession of the artifact. == Characters == * Omi * Raimundo Pedrosa * Kimiko Tohomiko * Clay Bailey * Dojo Kanojo Cho * Jack Spicer * Wuya * Chase Young Category:2000s American animated television series Category:2000s American children's television series Category:2003 American television series debuts Category:2006 American television series endings Category:English-language television programs",
