 "text": "The Arisaka rifles were the main rifles used by the Japanese military from 1897 to 1945. The most famous models were the Type 38 and Type 99 rifles. Under the direction of Colonel Arisaka Nariakira, who was eventually elevated to lieutenant general and granted the title of baron by Emperor Meiji in 1907, the Arisaka rifle was created. The German Rifle Test Commission 8mm Model 1888 bolt-action rifle, which was based on the previous Mauser design, was comparable to and might have impacted the design. The rifle saw numerous production runs throughout the span of several wars, during which time a number of variations were created. Category:Japanese weapons Category:Rifles",
