 "text": "The Moray Firth is a roughly triangular inlet (or firth) of the North Sea, north and east of Inverness, which is in the Highland council area of the north of Scotland. The firth has more than 800 kilometres (about 500 miles) of coastline, much of which is cliffs. The River Ness, the River Findhorn and the River Spey all flow into it. The Caledonian Canal goes from the southern end of the firth to the west coast at Corpach near Fort William. ==References== Category:North Sea Category:Highland Category:Geography of Scotland",
