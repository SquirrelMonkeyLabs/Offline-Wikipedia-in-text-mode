In 2010, Deen launched the Unpious website along with \"Shtreimel,\" another ex-Hasidic blogger, and has served as its editor throughout. He has also written several pieces for other publications on the intersection of Hasidic and secular lives, including articles in the Jewish Daily Forward, Tablet Magazine, Salon, and Zeek. He currently serves as a Board member at Footsteps, a New York City organization that assists formerly ultra-Orthodox Jews with transitioning to life outside the Orthodox world. == Personal life == Deen spent his early life among Satmar Hasidim in Borough Park, Brooklyn, and joined the Skverer sect when he was a teenager, moving to the town of New Square, to settle after marriage. He was married in 1993, and has five children.
