 "text": "Quyet's bush frog (Gracixalus quyeti) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam in Phong Nhaâ€“Ke Bang National Park and in Laos in Hin Nam No National Protected Area and Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area. People have seen this frog between 300 and 1100 meters above sea level. G. quyeti is smaller than most other frogs in the family Rhacophoridae. It has a triangle-shaped spot between its eyes. The skin of the frog's back is dark brown in color with a Y-shaped mark. There is some yellow-white color on the chest, with brown marks. This frog lives in evergreen forests in low places, evergreen forests on hills, and forests where there is much karst rock in the ground. Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on leaves over water and that tadpoles swim in the water, but they are not sure. Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to build roads and farms and to get things from the forest. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
