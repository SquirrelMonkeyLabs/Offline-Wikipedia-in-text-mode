They led organised crime from Bethnal Green in the East End of London, from the late 1950s to 1967. Their gang, \"the Firm\", committed murder, armed robbery, arson, protection rackets and assaults. The Krays, who were homosexual, were protected by two leading homosexuals in Parliament: Robert Boothby (later Lord Boothby), a leading Conservative member, and Tom Driberg, a leading Labour Party member.Barrett, David (26 July 2009). \"Letters shed new light on Kray twins scandal\".

Although no names were printed, the twins threatened investigating journalists. Boothby threatened to sue the newspaper with the help of Labour Party leader Harold Wilson's solicitor, Arnold Goodman. In the face of this, the Sunday Mirror backed down, sacking its editor, printing an apology and paying Boothby Â£40,000 in an out-of-court settlement. Because of this, other newspapers were unwilling to expose the Krays' connections and criminal activities. Decades later, Channel 4 established the truth of the allegations and released a documentary on the subject called The Gangster and the Pervert Peer (2009).

It was the longest murder hearing in the history of British criminal justice. Justice Melford Stevenson said of the sentences \"I recommend [they] should not be less than thirty years\". In March 1969, both were sentenced to life imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 30 years for the murders.
