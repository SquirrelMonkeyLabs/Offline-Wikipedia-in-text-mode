It served the inhabitants living north of the river within the vast Northern Neck holdings of Lord Fairfax. His agent, Robert \"King\" Carter, promoted the establishment of the town. The Carter family played a dominant role in the town's growth throughout much of the colonial period. Originally located within King George County, Falmouth became part of Stafford County when county lines were redrawn in 1776. During the American Civil War, Falmouth was occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Northern commanders located their headquarters southeast of the town during the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns. Today Falmouth is a residential community and a suburb of Fredericksburg. Among the community's significant historic structures is Belmont, the home of American artist Gari Melchers, now a historic house museum administered by the University of Mary Washington. Chatham Manor, the 1771 home of William Fitzhugh and a Union headquarters during the Civil War, is located downstream from Falmouth, opposite the historic district of Fredericksburg. It is administered by the National Park Service as part of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park and now serves as park headquarters. ==Geography== Falmouth is located at (38.331790, -77.461361).
