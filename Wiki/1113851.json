 "text": "The flag of Lyon () consists of a rectangular cloth on which the elements of its coat of arms are displayed, it is therefore a heraldic flag. Habitually it counts on habitual proportions of 3:2 and it is a flag for civil use, since in the City hall and its dependencies only the French national flag is raised. The shield proper of Lyon consists of a field of gules (red color), in which a lion appears rampant (of profile and erect) and of silver (white color). This coat of arms is augmented from a heraldic chief, the division occupying the upper third. This is the \"Head of France\", granted to all \"Bonnes Villes\", which shows the heraldry of his former monarchs: of azure laden with three golden fleurs de lys (a blue background adorned with three yellow lily flowers). ==Related pages== * Lyon ==References== Lyon Category:Lyon",
