Its servile state has now finally ceased. The martial turmoil of yesterday, and the horrible clamour of war, 𝄆 are followed today, in harmonious contrast, by sweet hymns of peace and unity. 𝄇 Let us keep the lofty name of our Fatherland in glorious splendour. And, on its altars, once more we must swear: To die before we would live as slaves! To die before we would live as slaves! To die before we would live as slaves! II Eternal praise to the brave warriors whose heroic valour and firmness conquered the freedom and glories that now a happy Bolivia justly begins to enjoy! Let their names, preserved forever in marble and bronze, transmit their glory to remote future ages. 𝄆 And in resounding songs let them repeat: Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! 𝄇 III Here has Justice erected its throne which vile oppression ignores and, on its glorious laurel it bequeathed us Freedom, freedom, freedom This innocent and beautiful land, which owes its name to Bolívar, 𝄆 is the happy homeland where mankind enjoys the benefits of bliss and peace. 𝄇 IV If a foreigner may, any given day even attempt to subjugate Bolivia, let him prepare for a fatal destiny, which menaces such superb aggressor. For the sons of the mighty Bolívar have sworn, thousands upon thousands of times: 𝄆 to die rather than see the country's majestic banner humiliated. 𝄇 === In indigenous languages === Aymara lyrics Aymara IPA Quechua lyrics Quechua IPA Guaraní lyrics Guaraní IPA Trinitario Moxos lyrics Trinitario Moxos IPA ==References== Bol Category:National symbols of Bolivia",
