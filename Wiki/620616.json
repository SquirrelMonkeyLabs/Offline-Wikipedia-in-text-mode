 "text": "An algebraic fraction is a fraction where the top and the bottom are algebraic expressions. Two examples of algebraic fractions are \\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3} and \\frac{\\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3}. A rational fraction is an algebraic fraction where the top and the bottom are polynomials. \\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3} is a rational fraction, but \\frac{\\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3} is not. This is because the top has a square root function. == Operations == === Multiplication === \\frac{x^2+9x+20}{x^2-4} \\cdot \\frac{x+2}{x+4} = \\frac{{\\color{Red}(x+4)}(x+5)}{{\\color{Red}(x+2)}(x-2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\color{Red}x+2}{\\color{Red}x+4} = \\frac{x+5}{x-2} === Division === Turn the equation into multiplication by flipping one of the fractions. After that, do what is shown above. \\frac{x^2+9x+20}{x^2-4} {\\color{Green}\\div} \\frac{\\color{Orange}x+2}{\\color{Blue}x+4} = \\frac{x^2+9x+20}{x^2-4} {\\color{Green}\\cdot} \\frac{\\color{Blue}x+4}{\\color{Orange}x+2} Category:Algebra Category:Fractions (mathematics)",
