The word hyphy was first created by American rapper Keak da Sneak. Other popular hyphy artists are Mac Dre, E-40 and Mistah F.A.B.. Many people view Mac Dre as the pioneer of the hyphy movement. Street racing, ghost riding and car stunt performances called \"sideshows\" are well known things in the hyphy movement. People will also \"go dumb\" or \"get stupid\", meaning to dance and make loud noises. ==References== Category:Music genres Category:Hip hop",
