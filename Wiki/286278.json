 "text": "This Tuesday in Texas was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on December 3, 1991 at Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. It was the WWF's experiment to let their secondary PPV events happen on Tuesdays. Fourteen professional wrestling matches happened on the card, but only the last five were aired on PPV. The main event was a rematch involving Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker. Lukewarm reaction made the experiment a failure. The next PPV to happen on a Tuesday was Taboo Tuesday in 2004. ==Results== ==References== Category:1991 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in San Antonio, Texas Category:World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view events Category:1990s in San Antonio, Texas Category:1991 in the United States",
