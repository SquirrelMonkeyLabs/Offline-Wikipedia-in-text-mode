 "text": "The Central United States is sometimes conceived as between the Eastern United States and Western United States as part of a three-region model, roughly coincident with the Midwestern United States plus the western and central portions of the Southern United States; the term is also sometimes used more or less as a synonym for the Midwest, leaving out all or most of the South. The Census Bureau does not provide a standard definition of \"Central\" region of the United States, and organizations that need to subdivide the US are free to define a \"Central\" region to fit their needs. ==References and other websites== *Central Time Zone Midwest minus OH, MI, most of Indiana (seasonal), and westernmost fringes of Plains states; plus South minus South Atlantic states, eastern KY, eastern TN, but western FL is included. *YPO Only 6 central states of the Midwest, plus KY *CERI All of Midwest and South including MD, DE *NOAA Midwest minus OH, plus KY, CO, WY *HSUS Midwest minus ND, SD, KS, plus KY *USGS West North Central States, South Central United States, 4 eastern Mountain States *Adventure Camp Midwest plus South minus Atlantic states, AL, WV Category:Regions of the United States",
