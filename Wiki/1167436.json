 "text": "Bosnian nationalism is a political and cultural movement that emphasizes the identity, sovereignty, and unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rooted in the country's diverse history, it advocates for the preservation of Bosnian heritage, often focusing on a civic national identity that transcends ethnic divisions. While historically shaped by Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and Yugoslav influences, modern Bosnian nationalism is primarily associated with efforts to maintain Bosnia and Herzegovina as a unified, independent state amid regional and ethnic tensions.
