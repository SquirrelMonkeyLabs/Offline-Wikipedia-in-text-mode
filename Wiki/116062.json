The campus was first opened in 1872 as a farming and mechanical college and covers 2,600 acres. It is also one of only a few public universities in the United States to have a corps of cadets. The Virginia Tech massacre, which happened on the 16th of April 2007, was a tragedy in the history of the University. A student of the university named Cho Seung-Hui killed 32 people before killing himself. This became the worst school-related massacre in United States history. ==References== * Category:Atlantic Coast Conference Category:Colleges and universities in Virginia Category:Oak Ridge Associated Universities Category:1872 establishments in the United States Category:19th-century establishments in Virginia",
