 "text": "Tasmanian oak (or Australian oak) is hardwood timber. It is a light-colored, medium-density wood, used for building, furniture, flooring and paper. It is not an oak, and not related to oak, but is yielded by some species of Eucalyptus trees in Tasmania. These trees belong to Eucalyptus regnans, Eucalyptus obliqua or Eucalyptus delegatensis. Wood from the same species of trees in Victoria is called \"Victorian ash\". == References == Category:Tasmania Category:Wood Category:Eucalyptus",
