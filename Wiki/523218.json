 "text": "The members of Triatominae are a subfamily of Reduviidae. They are also called kissing bugs, conenose bugs, assassin bugs or triatomines. There are more than 130 species in this subfamily. Most of them feed on vertebrate blood. A few species feed on other invertebrates. They are mainly found in the Americas. There are a few species in Asia, Australia and Africa. Some of the bugs carry the Chagas disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. However, only those species (such as Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus) well adapted to living with humans are considered important vectors. ==References== Category:Hemiptera",
