 "text": "The New York City Police Department (NYPD), started in 1845, is the largest police force in the United States. There are approximately 36,000 Uniformed Police Officers and approximately 19,000 Civilian Members. It is the police force that serves the five boroughs of New York City. The NYPD was one of the first \"modern\" style police departments in the United States with the Boston Police Department. The NYPD uses a color of the day to allow uniformed officers to recognize undercover officers to prevent accidental shootings. == Street Crimes Unit == The NYPDâ€™s street crime unit (motto: \"We Own The Night\") was a 300+ member plain clothes unit for reducing crime that became well known after the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. The four officers involved in the shooting were all members of the street crime unit. The unit was ended in 2002 because of the Diallo shooting. The unit's last leader was Inspector Bruce H. Smolka, who was later made Assistant Chief. The street crime unit has been replaced by the local precincts Anti-Crime Units. All of the officers involved in the shooting were found not guilty of the criminal charges in a long trial that took place in Albany after a successful request to change the location of the trial from the Bronx, where the shooting happened. The street crime unit was started in 1971 and had a long history of success in catching armed criminals on NYC streets. The establishment of the street crime unit led to the development of the color of the day undercover officer recognition system. == References == == Other websites == * * The NYPD Diaspora, City Journal, Summer 2008 * On the Front Line in the War on Terrorism, City Journal, Summer 2007 * NYPD-Badges * NYPD-Current Badges * Auxiliary Police Benevolent Association * Unofficial School Safety Myspace Page * Full listing of NYPD Officers who have been killed in the line of duty * NYCPR and COPP NYC police misconduct organizations * NY Daily News March 12, 2007 * From database to crime scene: Network is potent police weapon, by Thomas Lueck, New York Times, June 7, 2007 * AM New York, December 8, 2006 * Google Earth NYPD Car Model * Site with instruments used by Stephen Hasbrouck, First Surgeon General of the Department * Homepage for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the only official Civilian Oversight of Police Misconduct in NYC * Collection of NYPD- Badges and Informations about the NYPD Category:Law enforcement in New York City Category:Law enforcement agencies of the United States Category:1845 establishments in the United States Category:1840s establishments in New York (state)",
