 "text": "The King's Royal Hussars are a cavalry regiment in the British Army. == Regimental Identity == The King's Royal Hussars wear a brown beret and their cap badge depicts the Prussian Eagle. This is because Princess Frederica of Prussia awarded the symbol of the Royal House of Prussia to the 14th Light Dragoons in 1798. The letters 'FR' are above the eagle. Soldiers serving in the regiment also wear a brown stable belt with two yellow stripes. HRH Prince Albert permitted the regiment to wear crimson trousers, which still form a part of the uniform today. The regimental quick march is 'The King's Royal Hussars', whilst the slow march is 'Coburg' and the general salute is 'The Eagle'. Category:British Army regiments Category:Cavalry",
