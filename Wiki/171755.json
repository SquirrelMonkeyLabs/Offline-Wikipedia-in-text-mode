 "text": "Tangerine Dream is a German music band that was started in 1967. The band was very important for the development of what is known as electronic music today. Together with Ash Ra Tempel and Agitation Free they made Berlin School possible. Their early works are usually seen as a type of Krautrock. Many people classify their music as New Age. The band does not see itself in this category though. Their music is sometimes seen as symphonic, or as a kind of ambient music, with a focus on electronically making the sounds used. They often let themselves be influenced by rock music. Category:German rock bands Category:New wave bands Category:Electronic music groups",
