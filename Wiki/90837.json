 "text": "The Strokes are an American band formed in 1998. They became famous in the early 2000s as a leading group in the garage rock revival. The members of the band are Julian Casablancas, Nick Valensi, Albert Hammond Jr., Nikolai Fraiture and Fabrizio Moretti. The band has released six studio albums, but their first album, Is This It is their most famous. ==Band history== Casablancas, Moretti and Valensi were the first members of the band and started playing together when they were still in high school. In 1998, Hammond joined the band. They spent two years playing live in New York City, but no one really listened to them. They recorded some songs and sent them to record labels, but their offers were not accepted. On October 2000, the band went to Gordon Raphael's studio and recorded songs, but with no extra effects. Rough Trade Records founder Geoff Travis found out the songs and released them as The Modern Age EP. The Strokes were also featured in a famous magazine, the NME. Because of these, the band was noticed by a lot of people, but most of those people were in the UK. == Discography == * Is This It (2001) * Room on Fire (2003) * First Impressions of Earth (2006) * Angles (2011) * Comedown Machine (2013) *The New Abnormal (2020) == References == == Other websites == * The Strokes Official Website * The Strokes on imeem * The Strokes Official MySpace * NME Artist page * Guardian Unlimited bio from December 16, 2001 Category:Musical groups from New York City",
