Skull bossing may happen from different medical conditions.M. Sperling: Pediatric Endocrinology. p.748 Saunders; 3 edition (2008) ==Frontal bossing== Frontal bossing is when the forehead becomes bigger than normal which may also make the brow ridge (eyebrow part of the face) stick out more. It happens when the frontal bone becomes bigger because of a medical condition. This often happens when other facial bones of the skull become bigger too, as well as the jaw bone and the bones in the hands and feet. Frontal bossing is usually seen in a few rare medical syndromes such as acromegaly - a chronic medical disorder in which the anterior pituitary gland makes to much growth hormone (GH).PubMed Health: Frontal bossing ==Turricephaly== Turricephaly often called \"tower skull\", may be caused by different medical conditions. In some cases such as Apert and Pfeiffer syndromes, it is caused when sutures in the skull close before they are supposed to.The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Paleopathology. Arthur C.
