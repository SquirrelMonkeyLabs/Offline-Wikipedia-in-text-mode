 "text": "Solar rotation is the term for the Sun moving around its axis of rotation. Like other objects in space, the Sun rotates. Unlike many objects, the areas of the Sun rotate at different speeds. At the equator, one complete rotation takes about 24 and a half days. At the poles, one rotation takes about 38 days. The difference in speeds is caused by the fact that the Sun is a ball of gas. Because it is not solid, different parts move at different speeds. The upper and lower chromosphere rotates when the sun rotates. == References == rotation",
