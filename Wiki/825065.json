Throughout the Animal Crossing series, the player character is a human who lives in a village with many anthropomorphic animals (animals who act like people). The player carries out various activities such as fishing, bug catching, and fossil hunting. The series is known for its open-ended gameplay and use of the video game console's internal clock and calendar to show real passage of time. The first game in the series was originally only released in Japan for the Nintendo 64. The first Animal Crossing in other areas was released on the Nintendo Gamecube in 2001. The most recent entry in the series is Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which was released in late March of 2020.
