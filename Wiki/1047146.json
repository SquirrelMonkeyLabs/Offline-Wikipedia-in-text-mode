It was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). During the early 2000s, vocalist Darren Hayes was married to a woman but was questioning his sexuality. He eventually came out as gay. During an interview with Billboard, they asked Hayes if any of the group's songs hinted at his sexuality. Hayes said \"I Want You' is a song about a dream about being in love with a male energy, and waking up and feeling sad that I knew there was a part of me that was missing.\"\" The song was the ending theme song for the Diamond is Unbreakable arc of the anime JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1996 songs Category:Debut singles Category:JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Category:Synth-pop songs Category:Savage Garden songs",
