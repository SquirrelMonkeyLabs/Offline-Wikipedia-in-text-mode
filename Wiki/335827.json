It was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in the UK, the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland. It and its video has been criticized for being misogynistic and promoting rape culture. It was later banned at Leeds Student Union, Edinburgh Student Union, University of Derby, Kingston University, University of Bolton, and The University of West Scotland for these reasons. \"The song hugely objectifies women and excuses rape culture,” Hollie O’Connor, president of the University of Derby Students’ Union, told NBC News. “It is a man suggesting that there are ‘blurred lines’ when it comes to sexual consent and that is unacceptable. We felt we needed to take a stand.” Numerous parodies of the video were released online. Thicke responded to criticism by calling it 'ridiculous'. He said the lyrics are about \"blurring the lines between men and women and how much we're the same\" and \"blurred lines between a good girl and a bad girl.\" On July 30 the album Blurred Lines was released in the US.
