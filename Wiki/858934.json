 "text": "YouTube Kids is an official YouTube app made for kids. It is safer for kids to use YouTube Kids more than YouTube, due to the content being made specifically for younger audiences. Parents can block unwanted videos, or only allow select videos to be seen. Only videos that are made for kids come up. However, it is criticized for having videos that look kid-friendly, but aren't. The platform imports videos from the original YouTube app, with only a check mark or an automatic modification allowing a copy of the video to show up on the YouTube Kids app. Many videos that are not family-friendly, mainly edited clips that use characters from family-oriented TV shows, are automatically moved to the children's platform without the creator's consent, easily creating problems on the app. W ==Shows Changing Networks== Content setting(s) Show Moved from Moved to Premiere date Older (ages 9â€“12) The Ellen DeGeneres Show NBC YouTube January 1, 2023 Category:YouTube",
