 "text": "The Battle of Agincourt was fought on 25 October 1415. It was a major win for England against France in the Hundred Years' War and led to several later English victories. King Henry V of England led the English army, and Constable of France Charles d'Albret led a larger French army. King Charles VI of France did not engage because he of his mental illneess. Henry V was involved in hand-to-hand combat and was struck by an axe, but his helmet saved him. The English longbow was an important weapon for killing and winning this battle. It was more powerful than the French crossbow and was more numerous. Most of the army were bowmen. The English army used sharp wooden archer's stakes to protect the archers from French mounted knights. The English took prisoners but killed all of them except those of high rank. Overall, the French lost 8000 men and the English lost 100, but historians are unsure of the actual numbers. The French mainly lost because they wore heavy armour and got stuck in the sticky mud at Azincourt (Agincourt).
