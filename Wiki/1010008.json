 "text": "Dental fillings, or Dental restoration, is the work of dentists repairing teeth. For a filling the dentist has to remove decay with a drill, a laser or air abrasion. Air abrasion is a bit like sand blasting. Then the hole must be filled, usually with amalgam. There are different kinds of fillings. For some problems inlays and onlays, crowns, bridges, and veneers may be used. If the tooth has been removed it may be replaced by a dental implant which is fixed into the jaw, or by a denture (false teeth), which may be fixed to the remaining teeth or may be removeable. ==References== Category:Dentistry",
