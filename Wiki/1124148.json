She was a former chairperson of the Imo State Council for Arts and Culture and she was also the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Centre for Women Development during the regime of former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2013.

On 30 July 2024, Onwenu passed out after performing at a friend's birthday party in Lagos. She was immediately taken to Reddington Hospital where she was confirmed dead. Onwenu was 72. ==Legacy and tributes== Today, the impact of Onyeka Onwenu is seen to have resonated far beyond music, as Onwenu was said to have \"impacted many lives positively through her remarkable versatility and she truly lived a Christian life that is worthy of emulation\". Onwenu's influence as a singer, songwriter, actress, journalist and activist earned her an appellation of being \"the versatile queen of African pop\", according to a Nigerian religious figure Isaiah Ogedegbe. A Nigerian reporter had earlier referred to her as the \"Elegant Stallion\" in the Nigerian media. She was noted \"for her contribution to music and arts in Nigeria\", which had earned her multiple national and international awards. The news of Onwenu's demise in late July 2024 had sparked reactions online, with the death being described by Isaiah Ogedegbe as \"a colossal loss not only to her family, but also to the people of Imo State and the entire country\". President of Nigeria, Bola Tinubu also rendered tribute, calling Onwenu a \"versatile and extremely gifted artiste\". While the President opined that her legacy \"lives on in her immortal masterpieces\", a cleric in Warri also expressed a similar view that the late Onwenu lives on in \"the other side of life\". Regardless of one's opinion, Onwenu's life continues to trigger discussions about her many roles in the music, film, media, social and political arenas. She was said to have been \"marked by a remarkable versatility\", to have left an \"indelible mark on Nollywood\" and to have made an \"impact on Nigerian culture\". As Onwenu's \"legacy in Nigeria's cultural and political landscape remains profound and enduring\". Onwenu was a philanthropist. In the wake of her death, she was also noted for her contribution to humanitarian causes, \"often donating to organisations focused on education, healthcare, and women's empowerment\". Her life of philanthropy seemed to \"serve as a reminder of the significant influence celebrities can wield for greater good\". Onwenu was a deeply pious woman, who was described by another Nigerian reporter as \"the sweet Igbo Christian lady\". On the religious front, she was also recognized for her exemplary adherence to the Christian lifestyle. Onwenu was not only an \"exemplary symbol of womanhood\" but also a unifying factor, with an \"exemplary sense of unity\". She was widely commended for her \"outstanding intellect, eloquence, and oration\", with a eulogy describing \"Onwenu's exit as the end of an era\". Onwenu, who looked the epitome of \"unity and peaceful coexistence\", was to \"be remembered for all her contributions to the Nigerian entertainment industry, our educational system, religious circles and our political space\". On 16 August 2024, The Warri Times once again republished Ogedegbe's tribute to Onwenu, which was originally published by The Eagle Online two weeks prior to republication. ==Burial== Exactly one month after her demise, Onwenu was buried on Friday, August 30, 2024 at one private vault in Ikoyi Cemetery in Ikoyi, Lagos State, Nigeria, according to a BBC News Pidgin report. In spite of being influential, yet it was \"a simple and private burial\" that she was given by her family in line with her directive. Having been presented by Isaiah Ogedegbe as a role model for the Christian life in the wake of her death, Onwenu was said to have been buried with her Bible placed on top of her coffin by one of her sons. Her two sons survived her, and they were credited with \"ensuring that the ceremonies were conducted with the dignity and privacy she had requested\". ==References== ==Further reading== * * \"Onyeka Onwenu\" blog by Onwenu at WordPress website Category:1952 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Nigerian singers Category:Nigerian gospel singers Category:Nigerian singer-songwriters Category:Songwriters Category:20th-century composers Category:Nigerian musicians Category:Nigerian actors Category:Nigerian journalists Category:Nigerian activists Category:Nigerian politicians Category:People from Imo State",
