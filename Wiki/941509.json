She appeared in guest roles on television, including The Donna Reed Show, The Wide Country, G.E. True, Going My Way, The Andy Griffith Show, and Death Valley Days. Kupcinet was found dead at her home in West Hollywood, California on November 28, 1963 at the age of 22. Drugs were found next to her body, however in an autopsy found evidence of her being strangled. Since her death happened five days after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, her death has been part of many conspiracy theories. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:1963 deaths Category:American murder victims Category:Deaths by strangulation Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American stage actors Category:Actors from Chicago Category:Actors from Skokie, Illinois",
