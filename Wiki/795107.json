 "text": "A great conjunction is a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn. Great conjunctions occur regularly (every 19.6 years, on average) due to the combined effect of Jupiter's about 11.86-year orbital period and Saturn's 29.5-year orbital period. The last great conjunction happened on 21 December 2020. It was the closest great conjunction since 1623.Jupiter-Saturn Conjunction Series from 0 to 3000 AD. == References == ==Other websites== * The Great Conjunction at GeoGebra * Orbital Motion Simulation of Jupiter and Saturn at GeoGebra Category:Jupiter Category:Saturn",
