 "text": "Apollo 10 was a crewed F-Type mission of NASA's Apollo program to land a man on the surface of the Moon. It was the fourth crewed mission and was a full rehearsal for the actual landing by Apollo 11. It was launched on May 10, 1969. The three astronauts, Tom Stafford, John W. Young and Eugene Cernan went into orbit around the Moon. Stafford and Cernan flew the Lunar Module to just above the Moon's surface. The Apollo 10 crew reached the farthest point in their orbit around the far side of the Moon. They have been the farthest any human has traveled from the Earth's surface. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official NASA site Category:Apollo program Category:1969 in technology Category:1960s in spaceflight",
