 "text": "High-functioning autism (HFA) is an informal term given to autistic people who do not have an intellectual disability, but may exhibit difficulties in in communication, recognising emotions, and social interaction. The overlap between HFA and Asperger syndrome is subject to controversy; both are autism spectrum conditions. Many medical professionals, autistic people, and supporters of autistic rights disagree with the use of \"functioning\" labels, as many \"high-\" or \"low-functioning\" autistic people may be able to function differently at different times. \"Autism with/without intellectual disability\" is preferred. ==References== Category:Autism",
