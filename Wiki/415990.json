 "text": "The Great Redwall Feast is a picture book written by Brian Jacques. The pictures were drawn by the well-known Redwall artist Christopher Denise. It was published in 1996. ==Plot introduction== The Great Redwall Feast is the first Redwall picture book, and it was written like a ballad. The animals of Redwall Abbey prepare a surprise feast for their abbot. ==Plot summary== The Great Redwall Feast is a story about the creatures of Redwall preparing for a feast while Matthias the Warriormouse, Constance the Badger guardian, Foremole, and the Abbot are traveling in Mossflower Woods looking for a mysterious Bobbatan Weary Nod. The book shows the Abbeydwellers bustling in Redwall, cooking, gathering flowers, and doing other things for the feast for their beloved Abbot (probably Abbot Mordalfus). Many characters from Redwall and Mattimeo are in the book, but the baby mole Bungo is the only character in the book that wasn't in any Redwall novel. ==Illustrations and significance== The warm-colored pictures by Christopher Denise were drawn on brown butcher paper using pastels, and instead of showing the Redwallers getting ready for war, it shows them much happier and friendly, at work in their daily lives. Brian Jacques said that The Great Redwall Feast was \"written a little more for mothers to read to their children, but many Redwall lovers will also enjoy it, because there is the challenge of solving a riddle before the end of the rhyme.\" ==Translations== *(German) Das grofte Festmahl von Redwall ==References== Category:Redwall Category:1996 books",
