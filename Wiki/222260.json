Only two female specimens have even been caught. These were both caught in the Wanglang Natural Reserve and was first described by Wang Youzhi in 1985. Corbet and Hill (1991, 1992) relisted it under a new genus as Chaetocauda sichuanensis. It is the only member of the genus Chaetocauda. The two specimens had the following measurements: * Specimen 1: *: head and body length: *: tail length: *: weight: * Specimen 2: *: head and body length: *: tail length: *: weight: Cjaetocauda is nocturnal (it is awake at night) and arboreal (lives in trees). It nests in trees about above the ground and the two specimens were found at an altitude of more than above sea level. It is classified as endangered by the IUCN as of the 2004 Red List due to its small isolated habitat. Listed as DataDeficient (DD v2.3) ==References== * *Corbet, G.B. & Hill, J.E. 1991.
