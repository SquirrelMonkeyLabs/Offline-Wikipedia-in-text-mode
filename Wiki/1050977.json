 "text": "A pitch invasion (known in North America as field storming or rushing the field)happens when someone or a group of people watching a sports event rush onto the playing area, often to celebrate, protest, or create a spectacle. In many cases, these actions can lead to legal consequences, including criminal charges, fines, or even imprisonment. Additionally, the club associated with the event may face penalties, especially if the invasion disrupts the game. However, there are instances where pitch invasions are accepted or even celebrated if a large number of spectators enter the field when the game is not in progress. == References == Category:Terminology",
