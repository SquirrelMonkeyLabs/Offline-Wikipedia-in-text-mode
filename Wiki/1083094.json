 "text": "Casey Miller (Feb 26, 1919 – January 5, 1997) was an American feminist and writer. She was born in Toledo, Ohio, USA. Miller went to Smith College and studied philosophy. After college, she was a lieutenant in the navy during WWII and worked as a cryptographer and code breaker. She led the publication department for Colonial Williamsburg. She also worked as the curriculum editor for Seabury Press. Later on, she began to work on trying to change the use of \"he,\" \"him,\" and \"his\" in the English language to talk about all genders. She also tried to change other ways the English language sounded like it only talked about men, like using the word \"mankind\" and \"Congressman.\" Miller and her partner, Kate Swift, wrote many books like “The Handbook of Nonsexist Language.” Her wish was that English words would treat men and women equally. Miller wanted English speakers to use “tey”, “tem” and “ter” when the speaker did not know someone's gender, instead of using \"him\" for all people. She died from chronic obstructive lung disease. == References == Category:1919 births Category:1997 deaths Category:American feminists Category:American military people Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024",
