 "text": "The gauss (symbol G) is the CGS unit used to measure magnetic fields. One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter. The tesla (symbol T) is the SI derived unit used to measure the strength of magnetic fields. There are 10,000 (104) gauss in one tesla. The unit is named in honor of the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss. == Example values == * 10−9–10−8 gauss – the magnetic field of the human brain * 0.31–0.58 gauss – the Earth's magnetic field at its surface * 25 gauss – the Earth's magnetic field in its core * 50 gauss – a typical refrigerator magnet * 100 gauss – a small iron magnet * 600-70,000 gauss – a medical magnetic resonance imaging machine * 1012–1013 gauss – the magnetic field on the surface of a neutron star * 4×1013 gauss – the quantum electrodynamic threshold * 1015 gauss – the magnetic field of some newly created magnetars * 1017 gauss – the upper limit to neutron star magnetism; no known object in the universe can generate a stronger magnetic field == References == Category:Units of measurement Category:Magnetism",
