 "text": "Endoxa was a concept Aristotle talked about. It refers to the opinion not of individuals (which he contrasts by naming that 'doxa') but the consensus of the population and wise people with a supposed more valid opinion than that of the individual. Aristotle employs a detailed and distinctive approach to clarify the relationship between incontinence, continence, and related conditions in relation to virtue and vice. He examines the prevailing beliefs about these states to discern what is right and wrong. == Related pages == *Common sense ==References== Category:Philosophy",
