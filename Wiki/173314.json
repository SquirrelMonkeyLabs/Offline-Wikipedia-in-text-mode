 "text": "Mount Carmel is a town of Hawkins County in the state of Tennessee in the United States. About 5,473 people were living in Mount Carmel as of 2020. It is a part of the area known as the \"Tri-Cities\". Mount Carmel once got national attention in the mid-2000s because of a CBS News story about the town's geography which is only on one side of the main road through the area. Since then, the city has bought property on the other side of the road and has built a cemetery. == References == Category:Towns in Tennessee Category:Tri- Cities, Tennessee",
