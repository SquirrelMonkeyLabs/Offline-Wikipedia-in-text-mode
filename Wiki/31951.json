 "text": "\"\" (; \"Army March\") is the national anthem (song) of Vietnam. It was created in 1944 by Nguyễn Văn Cao, a Vietnamese composer (person who writes music). It was also the national anthem of North Vietnam until the joining of North and South Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War. ==Lyrics== The national anthem went through many changes since the 1940s. Though there are two verses, the first one is usually only sung as the anthem. Recently, the Vietnam Center for Music Copyright stated that they will \"collect royalty\" from the song, meaning that it would be under copyright. ==References== Category:Vietnamese music Category:1944 songs Category:Asian anthems",
