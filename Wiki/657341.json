 "text": "In baseball, an outfield assist occurs when an outfielder throws out a baserunner somewhere along the base paths, often at one of the bases. The most famous examples of outfield assists are plays made at home plate (plays at the plate), when the outfielder throws the ball to the catcher or other defensive player guarding home plate, and the defensive player then successfully tags out the baserunner who is trying to score.
