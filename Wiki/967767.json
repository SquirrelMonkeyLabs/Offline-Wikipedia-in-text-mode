The character was created by Roy Thomas and Jerry Ordway, first appearing in All-Star Squadron #25 (1983). James Robinson, David S. Goyer and Steve Sadowski reinvented him as Atom Smasher in JSA Secret Files and Origins #1 (1999). He has since become a member of the Justice Society of America. == Fictional character biography == The godson of Al Pratt, the Golden Age Atom, Albert Rothstein acquired his metahuman powers of super strength and control over his molecular structure, allowing him to alter the size and density of his body, from his grandfather, a reluctant supervillain known as Cyclotron. This allowed him to fight crime first as Nuklon, and then, later, as Atom Smasher. As Nuklon, Albert was a charter member of Infinity, Inc. and subsequently served in the Justice League. He was considered a dependable, but rather insecure and indecisive superhero while in Infinity, Inc. During this time he had a mohawk haircut. While in the JLA, he forged a strong friendship with fellow former Infinity Inc. teammate Obsidian. == Powers and abilities == Atom Smasher is known for his power of growth and super strength. == In other media == The character made its live-action debut in The Flash, played by Adam Copeland. The character appears in the DC Extended Universe movie Black Adam (2022), played by Noah Centineo. Category:DC Comics characters",
