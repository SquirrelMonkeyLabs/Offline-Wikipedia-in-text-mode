He was the son of the High King of Ireland Conaire Cóem and Queen Saraid, as well as brother of a king of Munster, where he used to live. According to one source, he was killed by a court musician and was buried in Ulster. Eochaid was possibly given Dál Riata when his brother received Munster. == References == Category:Kings and Queens of Scotland Category:180s deaths",
