It dissipated on the 23rd causing no damage to land and only threatening land briefly. There were two storm in the month of January but they formed in December, they were: Hurricane Alice in 1954 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Since 1978 there has never another Tropical or Subtropical cyclone to form in the month of January. ==Name== Because there was no naming system for Subtropical Storms at the time, this was called Subtropical Storm One, had it been given a name it would be \"Subtropical Storm Amelia\". ==References== Category:Subtropical cyclones Category:1978 Category:1970s in weather",
