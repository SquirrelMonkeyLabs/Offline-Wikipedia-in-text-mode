 "text": "Cheshire is a county in the north west part of England. A long time ago, about 220 million years ago, there was rock salt that was put down in this area. This happened during the Triassic period. Long ago, water from the big ocean came into the land and made a line of marshes with salty water in a place now called the Cheshire Basin. When the water in the marshes went away, it left behind big layers of salt that turned into hard rocks over time. == References == * Calvert, A F (1915), Salt in Cheshire, London: E and F N Spon * Hewitson, C (2015), The Open Pan: The Archaeology and History of the Lion Salt Works, Lion Salt Works Trust Research Report 6 * Lightfoot, Tom (2000), Open Pan Salt Making in Cheshire: An Illustrated Description, Lion Salt Works Trust Research Report 1 == Other websites == * Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse, Northwich * Romans Salt Manufacturers' Association * Anglo Saxons Salt Manufacturers' Association * Normans Salt Manufacturers' Association * Winsford Rock Salt Mine Category:Cheshire",
