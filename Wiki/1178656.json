The VNQDD tried to make a Nationalist Revolution and declare the independence of the Indochina from France in early 1930. At that time, France was the control of the Indochina. But France stopped the revolution, after the Yên Bái mutiny in 1929. After the Vietnam War, the party was banned by the Communist Party of Vietnam and they moved their headquarters to United States in 1975. == Sources == * Blair, Anne E. (2001).
