 "text": "Castel Maggiore is a comune in the Metropolitan City of Bologna in the Emilia- Romagna region in Italy. The earliest records mentioning the Comune, formerly known as Castaniolo (meaning \"Little chestnut\"), come from the tenth century. According to the mythology, the name originates from a large chestnut trunk that is said to have floated through the Canale Navile, a navigable drain canal, into the comune's territory. Later, Castaniolo was known as Maggiore (Major) to differentiate it from a namesake hamlet of the comune of Bentivoglio (now Castaniolo Minore). == References == Category:Settlements in Bologna",
