 "text": "The black hole information paradox is a phenomenon in astrophysics. It is when quantum mechanics and general relativity are put together. In 2004, Stephen Hawking introduced the studies which supported the theory. This phenomenon states that the information of a physical system can be lost when it enters a black hole. The object that falls into a black hole, only keeps information about its spin, mass and charge. However, quantum mechanics suggests that information cannot be lost. This makes it a paradox and serious problem. It is said that all objects that fall into a black hole are reset. Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Black holes",
