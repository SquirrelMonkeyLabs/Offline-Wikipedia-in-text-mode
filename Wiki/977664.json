 "text": "The national anthem of Lebanon (, ) was adopted in 1927. ==Lyrics== Arabic original Romanisation (EALL) IPA transcription ===Translations=== French translation Literal English translation Poetic English translation I All of us for the homeland, for excellence, for the flag, Filling the eye of time, our sword and pen. Our plain and mountain – a breeding ground of men, Our speech and work – in the manner of perfection. All of us for the homeland, for excellence, for the flag All of us for the homeland. II Our elder and youth – in reach of the voice of the homeland, A lion of jungles when we rushed into the wars. Our East's heart – forever Lebanon, Protected by the Lord for the duration of time. III Its sea, its land – the pearl of the two Easts. Its supporter – its righteousness, filling the two poles. Its name – its honour, since the forefathers have existed. Its glory – its cedar, its symbol for eternity. I All of us! For our Country, for our Glory and Flag! Our valor and our writings are the envy of the ages. Our mountain and our valley, they bring forth stalwart men. And to Perfection we devote our words and labor. All of us! For our Country, for our Glory and Flag! All of us! For our Country! II Our Elders and our children, they await our Country's call, And on the Day of Crisis they are as Lions of the Jungle. The heart of our East is ever Lebanon, God has preserved her until the end of time. III The Gems of the East are her land and sea. Throughout the world her good deeds flow from pole to pole. And her name is her glory since time began. The cedars are her pride, her immortality's symbol. ==References== Leb Category:Lebanese culture Category:1927 works",
