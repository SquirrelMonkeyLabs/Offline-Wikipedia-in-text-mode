 "text": "The European Capital of Culture is a city (or multiple cities) chosen by the European Union for a period of one calendar year. The city is given a chance to show its cultural life and cultural development. Most of the cities are very popular and are known internationally (by people around the world). The idea to have a European Capital of Culture came from Melina Mercouri who was the Minster for Culture in Greece. It began in 1985. It was originally known as the 'European City of Culture' until 1999, when it was re-named 'European Capital of Culture'. The European Capitals of Culture for 2025 are Chemnitz in Germany, and Nova Gorica in Slovenia (with Gorizia in Italy). == List of by year == === Past years === List of capitals chosen by year Year Cities Image Details 1985 Athens 1986 Florence 1987 Amsterdam 1988 West Berlin 1989 Paris Lyon 1990 Glasgow 1991 Dublin 1992 Madrid 1993 Antwerp 1994 Lisbon 1995 Luxembourg 1996 Copenhagen 1997 Thessaloniki 1998 Stockholm 1999 Weimar 2000 Avignon Bergen Bologna Brussels Helsinki Krakow Prague Reykjavík Zaragoza 2001 Porto Rotterdam 2002 Bruges Salamanca 2003 Graz 2004 Genoa Lille 2005 Cork, Limerick 2006 Patras 2007 Sibiu Luxembourg Greater Region Sibiu 2007 2008 Liverpool Stavanger Sandnes Liverpool 2008 Stavanger 2008 2009 Linz Vilnius Vilnius 2009 Linz 2009 2010 Essen Sarajevo Pécs Essen 2010 Pecs 2010 2011 Turku Tallinn Turku 2011 Tallinn 2011 2012 Guimarães Maribor Guimarães 2012 Maribor 2012 2013 Marseille Košice Marseille Provence 2013 Košice 2013 2014 Riga Umeå 2015 Mons Plzeň 2016 San Sebastián Wrocław 2017 Aarhus Paphos 2018 Leeuwarden Valletta 2019 Matera Plovdiv 2020-2021 Galway Rijeka 2022 Esch-sur-Alzette Kaunus Novi Sad 2023 Eleusis Timișoara Veszprém 2024 Bad Ischl Bodø Tartu 2025 Chemnitz Nova Gorica with Gorizia === Future years === These are the planned European Capitals of Culture, according to the official EU website.
