In 1967, Tim Horton joined with investor Ron Joyce, who quickly took over running the company and expanded the chain into a multi- million dollar franchise. Tim Hortons stores quickly spread and together with Subway, became bigger than McDonald's and is now Canada's largest chain of fast food restaurants. The company opened twice as many Canadian stores as did McDonald's\"Wendy's confirms Tim Hortons IPO by March\", Ottawa Business Journal, December 1, 2005, and sales also are bigger than those of McDonald's Canadian restaurants as of 2002.\"Marketer of the Year: Down-Home Smarts\", Marketing Magazine, February 7, 2005, The chain got 22.6% of all fast food industry revenues in Canada in 2005. Tim Hortons also has 76% of the Canadian market for baked goods (based on the number of customers) and has 62% of the Canadian coffee market (compared to Starbucks, who is the second largest with 7%).\"Tim Hortons Raises C$783 Million in Initial Offering\", Bloomberg News, March 23, 2006 Tim Hortons had 2,733 restaurants in Canada as of July 1, 2007. Tim Hortons also has international restaurants with 500 in the United States as of December 2008, with one opened in Detroit and owned by former NBA player Derrick Coleman and one on a Canadian military base outside Kandahar, Afghanistan. Tim Hortons' other international efforts include a small outlet at the Dublin Zoo. Tim Hortons also made a deal with the SPAR store chain in the UK and Ireland, with Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts being sold at small self service counters in 16 SPAR stores. == History == === Tim Horton and Ron Joyce === The company's first store opened in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario under the name \"Tim Horton Donuts\" (the word donut would later be dropped and the company name ended up as just \"Tim Horton's\", and later was changed to \"Tim Hortons\" without the apostrophe). The business was started by Tim Horton, who played in the National Hockey League from 1949 until his death in a car accident in 1974. Soon after Horton opened the store, he met Ron Joyce, a former Hamilton police constable. In 1965, Joyce took over the Tim Horton Donut Shop on Ottawa Street North in Hamilton. By 1967, after he had opened up two more stores, he and Tim Horton became full partners in the business. After Horton's death in 1974, Joyce bought the company from the Horton family and took over as the only owner of the now forty stores. Joyce expanded the chain quickly in geography and in product selection, opening the 500th store in Aylmer, Quebec, in 1991. Ron Joyce's very fast expansion of the Tim Hortons business brought about two major changes in the coffee and doughnut restaurant market: independent doughnut shops in Canada were almost wiped out, and Canada's per person ratio of doughnut shops rose past those of all other countries.\"The unofficial national sugary snack\", Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, September 1, 1994 By the 1990s, the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd but the name of the restaurants are still called Tim Hortons. This was because the company wanted to also go into other types of business, and not just be seen as a doughnut company. In March 2006, shares of the company were first sold to the public. === Expansion and takeover === TDL Group had $1.48 billion in sales in 2005 and has expanded across Canada and also in New York, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Maine. In August 2014, the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital announced it was going to buy out the TDL Group and merge operations of Tim Hortons with that of Burger King. This was done to make it easier to make Tim Hortons a world- wide chain, just like how Burger King is. The purchase was completed in December of that year, and since then, both Tim Hortons and Burger King are part of Restaurant Brands International, which is owned mostly by 3G Capital, but also by the previous shareholders of the two chains under the ticker . But in 2018, it was reported that Tim Hortons franchisees were complaining to the Government of Canada that Restaurant Brands International did not follow the rules that were made in order for the takeover to happen. === Tim Hortons and the Canadian military === Tim Hortons has many stores on or near many Canadian Forces Bases. TDL Group said in March 2006, that because they were asked by Chief of the Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier, it would open a store at the Canadian Forces operations base in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The new Kandahar store opened on June 29 2006, in a 40 ft trailer on the military base.\"Tim Hortons comes to Kandahar\", CBC.ca, June 29, 2006 == Growth of the Tim Hortons Chain == *Store #1 - Hamilton, Ontario - May 1964 *Store #100 - Thunder Bay, Ontario - December 1978 *Store #200 - Hamilton, Ontario - December 1984 *Store #300 - Calgary, Alberta - February 1987 *Store #400 - Halifax, Nova Scotia - February 1989 *Store #500 - Aylmer, Quebec - January 1991 *Store #700 - Moncton, New Brunswick - October 1993 *Store #1000 - Ancaster, Ontario - August 1995 *Store #1500 - Pickerington, Ohio - March 1997 (this was also Wendy's 5000th store) *100th US store – Columbus, Ohio - July 31 1998 *Store #2000 - Toronto, Ontario - December 2000 *Store #2500 - Cayuga, Ontario - September 2003 *Store #3000 - Orchard Park, New York - December 14, 2006Tim Hortons History, 2006 (Source: Tim Hortons Official HistoryTim Hortons official History - Growth of Tim Hortons) == Menu == Tim Hortons' first stores only sold two products - coffee and doughnuts.
