 "text": "VRChat is a virtual reality online game created for Meta, Rift, PCVR, and SteamVR headsets by Graham Gaylor. VRChat was released in beta on Oculus (now Meta) Rift headsets on January 16, 2014. The game was fully released for free early access on February 1, 2017 on Steam. == History == VRChat started off in beta for a prototype Oculus Rift headset. As the beta was developed and turned into early access it allowed for more platforms such as the Meta Quest headsets. === Trust Ranks === VRChat allows users to earn trust ranks by spending time on the game, making friends, and making content. You start off as a Visitor when you make a new account but if you merge your account on the website you become a New User. Once you make a few friends you'll become a User. After a while spent making more friends or content, you can become a Known User or you can purchase the VRChat Plus subscription and get an automatic rank boost. Once you've been on VRChat for a while you can become a Trusted User. === Content Building === VRChat lets its users create content for the game such as avatars or worlds. Using software like Unity or Blender you can make your own worlds and avatars. Recently to help with organization, VRChat added a Creator Companion which lets users add packages and sort their projects. VRChat is known for its many of popular worlds such as The Black Cat, Murder 4, etc. === Body Tracking === Using third party software VRChat allows PCVR players to use Full-Body Tracking which makes avatars that support it use all of its body parts. On October 27, 2022, VRChat released hand tracking on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro headsets. Using the front cameras on the Quest 2 and Quest Pro, it tracks your hands and fingers and utilizes them on avatars that support them and can replace the controllers. === VRChat Plus === VRChat allows users to purchase a subscription called VRChat Plus (VRC+) which lets users invite other users using custom pictures, have profile pictures and icons by their username, and recently allowed users who have the subscription to make groups, and gives you a higher trust rank or rank boost. You can purchase a month or a year non-renewable subscription for other users but you can only purchase a cancellable renewing month for yourself. == Reception == Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) was added on July 25, 2022 to combat malicious mods on PCVR. However, mods such as Avatar Search were also banned. EAC caused many performance issues to VRChat as some mods that helped with performance on PC and banned lots of other non-malicious mods. == References == Category:2014 video games Category:Early access video games Category:Free- to-play video games Category:HTC Vive games Category:Indie video games Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Meta Quest games Category:Obscenity controversies Category:Oculus Rift games Category:Social casual games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Virtual reality games Category:Windows games",
