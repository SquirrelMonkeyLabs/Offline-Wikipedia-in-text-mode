Terrile and Voyager Imaging Team Discovered in September 1989 Orbital characteristics Epoch 18 August 1989 Semi-major axis 50 075 ± 1 km Eccentricity 0.0002 ± 0.0002 Orbital period 0.31148444 ± 0.00000006 d Inclination 0.21 ± 0.02° (to Neptune equator) 0.21° (to local Laplace plane) Is a moon of Neptune Physical characteristics Dimensions 108×100×52 km Mass ~3.5 kg (based on assumed density) Mean density ~1.2 g/cm3 (estimate) Rotation period assumed synchronous Axial tilt ~zero presumably Albedo (geometric) 0.09 Surface temp. ~51 K mean (estimate) Atmosphere none Thalassa or Neptune IV, is the second closest moon to Neptune. It was named after a daughter of Aether and Hemera from Greek mythology. \"Thalassa\" is also the Greek word for \"sea\". Thalassa was discovered sometime before mid-September, 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe. It was given the designation S/1989 N 5\\. The discovery was said (IAUC 4867) on September 29, 1989, but the text only talks of \"25 frames taken over 11 days\", giving a discovery date of sometime before September 18. The name was given on 16 September 1991. Thalassa is not a sphere and shows no sign of any geological changes. Unusually for a non- spherical moon, it appears to be oddly shaped not able to be explained. == Other websites == * Thalassa Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration Category:Neptune's moons",
