This is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial, or administrative purposes. It was developed in part from a lunar calendar (陰曆 yinli) and in part from a solar calendar (陽曆 yangli).Hong Kong Observatory, \"The Chinese Agricultural Calendar (Nongli)\" ; \"The Chinese Calendar\" at Calendopaedia.com; retrieved 2013-1-1. ==History== The current version of the Chinese calendar was developed for the Chongzhen Emperor in the 17th century.York, Donald G. and Owen Gingerich. 2011.
