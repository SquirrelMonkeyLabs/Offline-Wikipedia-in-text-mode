 "text": "\"Come Ye Blessed\" (), also called the Pitcairn Anthem (), is the anthem of Norfolk Island and one of the two anthems of the Pitcairn Islands, the other being \"We from Pitcairn Island\". The lyrics are taken from the Gospel of Matthew (chapter 25, verses 34-36 and 40). ==Lyrics== Original lyrics Verses in the Easy English Bible Then shall the King Say unto them On his right hand: Come ye blessed of my Father Inherit the kingdom prepared for you From the foundation of the world I was hunger'd and ye gave me meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye took me in, Naked and ye clothed me, I was sick and ye visited me, I was in prison and ye came unto me In as much ye have done it unto one of the least of These my brethren Ye have done it unto me, Ye have done it unto me. Come here. My Father has been good to you. He has prepared a place for you in his kingdom. That kingdom has been ready for you Since the time that God made the world. I was hungry and you gave me some food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me some water to drink. I was visiting your town and you asked me to stay in your home. I did not have enough clothes and you gave me some clothes to wear. I was ill and you took care of me. I was in prison and you came to visit me there. You did all these things to help other people. They were not important people, but they were my friends. When you helped them, then you also helped me. ==References== Category:Australian anthems Category:Norfolk Island",
