 "text": "The ocean sunfish (Mola mola), also called the mola or sun fish, is a large ocean fish found in warm and temperate oceans. It is the heaviest known bony fish in the world. It has an almost circular, flattened body. This unusual fish swims by flapping its long pectoral and dorsal fins; the caudal fin is used as a rudder (for steering). Some sunfish have been seen floating on their sides at the top of the sea; they may be using the sun to heat themselves up. They eat crustaceans, starfish, jellyfish, sponges, mollusks, algae, plankton, squid, and small fish. The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally. == Description == === Appearance === The ocean sunfish has an unusual appearance. It does not have a caudal fin and has a pseudotail; the clavus. The body is round and oval-shaped. The dorsal fin and anal fin are extended, making the fish appear big. The dorsal and anal fin are used as the rudder. The fish lacks a swim bladder. === Skin === A sunfish's skin can vary from silver to white. The fish also gains the ability to vary skin color from dark to light, especially when attacked. == Range and behavior == === Range === Ocean sunfish are found in temperate and tropical waters of all oceans. === Behavior === Sunfish can sometimes be found in a group, but usually alone. They sometimes bask sideways. == Related pages == * List of fish common names == References == # Froese, Rainer, and Daniel Pauly, eds.
