 "text": "Barium nitrate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ba(NO3)2. It contains barium and nitrate ions. ==Properties== Barium nitrate is a colorless solid. It dissolves in water. It is an oxidizing agent. It releases a green flame when burned. It decomposes when heated to barium oxide, oxygen, and nitrogen dioxide. If it is heated in nitric oxide, it makes barium nitrite. It reacts with any sulfate or sulfuric acid to make barium sulfate. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting barium carbonate with nitric acid. It can also be prepared by reacting the solutions of sodium nitrate with barium chloride. ==Uses== Barium nitrate can be mixed with powdered aluminium and zinc. This makes an explosive. It is also used in fireworks to make a green color. It is added to thermite to make it ignite more easily. It is also used to make barium oxide. ==Safety== Barium nitrate is very toxic. Sulfates can be given if someone eats barium, because they turn it into nontoxic barium sulfate. ==Related pages== *Potassium nitrate Category:Nitrates Category:Barium compounds",
