Didactics is the descriptive and rational study of all teaching-related activities. Its objective is to analyze how teaching leads to learning. On the other hand, pedagogy is a practice-oriented discipline concerned with the study of the applied aspects of teaching in real teaching contexts inside the classroom. \"How to teach\" is what it does.
