This branch of psychology explores what goes on deep within us, beyond what we can see on the surface. == Understanding depth psychology == Depth psychology is all about diving into the \"why\" behind our actions and thoughts. It's like being a detective, searching for clues to understand ourselves better. Psychologists who specialize in depth psychology believe that our minds have layers, just like an onion. == Famous people in depth psychology == === Sigmund Freud === Often called the father of psychoanalysis, Freud believed in exploring the unconscious mind to understand our behaviors. He compared the mind to an iceberg, with most of it hidden beneath the surface. === Carl Jung === Jung expanded on Freud's ideas and introduced concepts like the collective unconscious, suggesting that we all share certain universal experiences and symbols. === Alfred Adler === Adler focused on the importance of individual experiences and the desire for self-improvement. He believed in understanding a person's unique perspective to unlock the mysteries of their mind. == References == Category:Psychology",
