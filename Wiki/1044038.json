They named their studio for a Malay language network \"last kopek\" which means \"last chance\" and changed the spelling to look like French. Les Copaque's logo is a little frog named Si Polan. This symbol was born from the Malay proverb like a frog under a shell, which means someone with broad insight, ignorance, and a person whose vision is not broad, the breadth is like a shell. The Polan, however he sits on top of the coconut shell, which means the desire to dream big and their ability to think outside the box Their first animated film project entitled Misi Mustahak which was made under the auspices of the two founders as a nomination by their institution, MMU, then won four awards in 2005: Best Work (\"Best of the 10th MVA 2005\") and Gold Medalist Film Short Animation (Open) at the 10th Anugerah Video Malaysia (MVA); Tertiary Student Projects (Creative Multimedia) at MSC- APICTA 2005; and Best of Multimedia University Collection 2005 at Creative Pixels, State Art Gallery.
