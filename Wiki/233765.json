 "text": "F major (or the key of F) is a musical major scale starting on F. Its key signature has one flat. Its relative minor is D minor and its parallel minor is F minor. F major is the home key of the English horn, the basset horn, the horn in F, the trumpet in F and the bass Wagner tuba. This means that if you want these instruments to sound in F major, you have to write in C major. Most of these sound a perfect fifth lower than written, except the trumpet in F which sounds a perfect fourth higher. (The basset horn also often sounds an octave and a fifth lower.) Of the six Overtures Francesco Maria Veracini wrote for Prince Friedrich Augustus in Dresden, most are in either F major or B-flat major because the prince's orchestra had a lot of wind instruments that played best in these keys. ==List of compositions in F Major== * Brandenburg Concertos Nos 1 & 2 - Johann Sebastian Bach * Piano Concerto No. 19 - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart * Symphony No. 6 in F Major, Op. 68, \"Pastoral\" - Ludwig van Beethoven * Symphony No. 3 in F Major, Op. 90 - Johannes Brahms * Piano Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich) - Dimitri Shostakovich * Concerto No. 3 in F major, Op. 8, RV 293, \"L'autunno\" - Antonio Vivaldi ==Scales and keys== Category:Musical keys Category:Major scales he:סולם מז'ורי#פה מז'ור",
