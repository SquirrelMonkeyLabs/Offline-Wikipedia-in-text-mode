 "text": "On 2 January 2024, Democratic Party of Korea leader Lee Jae-myung was stabbed while visiting the construction site of an airport in Gadeokdo, Busan. At 10:27 a.m. KST, the attacker went to Lee and asked for an autograph before stabbing him in the neck. Officials quickly went to protect Lee, and one of them covered his neck with a cloth. It was reported Lee was bleeding but remained conscious. Lee was taken to an ambulance at 10:47 a.m. and arrived at the regional trauma center at Pusan National University Hospital at 11:16 a.m. He was then transferred to Seoul National University Hospital. Lee suffered a \"one-centimetre wound on his neck\" with minor bleeding. His injuries were soon reported to be \"non life-threatening\". Lee underwent emergency surgery at Seoul National University Hospital later in the day. Democratic Party officials said that the surgery \"took longer than expected\" and medical officials were closely monitoring his progress. The suspect was arrested, and appeared to be in his 50s or 60s. ==References== Category:January 2024 events Category:2020s in South Korea Category:2024 in Asia Category:2020s crimes in Asia",
