 "text": "In the human body, there are three main types of chief cells which include the gastric chief cells, which are found in the stomach and help with digestion; the parathyroid chief cells, located in the parathyroid glands and help control calcium levels; and the type 1 chief cells, which are found in the carotid body and help regulate breathing. == Cell types == The gastric chief cell is a type of cell in the stomach that releases substances called pepsinogen and chymosin. Pepsinogen turns into the digestive enzyme pepsin when it meets hydrochloric acid made by other stomach cells.MeSH https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2012/MB_cgi?mode=&term;=Chief+Cells,+Gastric&field;=entry This type of cell also releases gastric lipase enzymes, which help break down fats into free fatty acids and simpler forms of glycerides. There is evidence that the gastric chief cell releases leptin when food is in the stomach. Leptin has been found in the pepsinogen granules of these cells. ==Reference== Category:Cell biology",
