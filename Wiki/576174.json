The network started broadcasting at exactly midnight in 20 March 2005, after at 23:59, Rádio Cidade said goodbye to its listeners after 25 years and played the last top 3 songs. The first on-air journalist was Carlos Nascimento. Currently, it serves ten cities: Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Vitoria, Joao Pessoa and Salvador. The first 4 cities carry the network's de facto flagship stations. Campinas and Ribeirao Preto (in 106.7 FM and 96.7 FM) stopped carrying BandNews FM programming in 2014. They are now branded as Band FM. BandNews FM is well known for its slogan Em 20 minutos, tudo pode mudar (In 20 minutes, everything can happen), which refers to how the news is updated every 20 minutes. This format (that allows listeners to tune in at any time of the day to get the leading stories of the moment) is inspired by 1010 WINS, America's most well-known news station. From 6:00 to 23:00, on these news blocks, 6 minutes of them being given to each individual affiliate for providing local stories, read by a local announcer. Normally there's a local-only news programme from 9:00 to 11:00. Overnights feature live national announcers, broadcast by all affiliates. The network also broadcasts selected Brazilian football matches, alongside Bandeirantes and CBN, two likewise-formatted radio networks. == Frequencies == * 96.9 MHz (São Paulo) * 90.3 MHz (Rio de Janeiro) * 89.5 MHz (Belo Horizonte) * 90.5 MHz (Brasília) * 96.3 MHz (Curitiba) * 99.1 MHz (Salvador) * 99.3 MHz (Porto Alegre) * 101.7 MHz (Fortaleza) * 103.3 MHz (João Pessoa) * 90.1 MHz (Vitória) Category:Brazilian culture Category:Radio Category:2005 establishments in South America Category:2000s establishments in Brazil",
