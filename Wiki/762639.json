 "text": "The Battle of Huế was a battle of the Vietnam War during the Tet Offensive. It happened between 31 January and 2 March 1968. Since Huế was part of an important route between Danang and the North Vietnam-South Vietnam border, Huế was an important target for communist Vietnamese soldiers to attack. The battle was one of the deadliest in the war. Even today, visitors to the city can see signs that the battle was fought in Huế. Some buildings that were damaged or destroyed were never fixed. Other buildings still have bullet holes left from the battle. Hue Hue Hue Category:Tet Offensive",
