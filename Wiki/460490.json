She was successful in getting back those five paintings, which included two portraits of her aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer. Altmann was born in Vienna, Austria. She died at age 94. The movie Woman in Gold is based on Altmann's life. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American Jews Category:Austrian Jews Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:People from Vienna",
