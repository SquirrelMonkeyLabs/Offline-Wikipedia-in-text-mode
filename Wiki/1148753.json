 "text": "Ectopoglossus saxatilis is a frog. It lives in Colombia. Scientists think it could also live in Panama. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. Scientists have only seen this frog in Cerro Tacarcuna. They found it near streams, near waterfalls, and in one cave. They saw the frog about 1100 meters above sea level. Scientists have not seen the frogs inside any protected parks, but they have seen it near two protected parks: Parque Nacional Los Katios in Colombia and Darien National Park in Panama. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether the frog is in danger of dying out, but the place where it lives is far from where humans go. Scientists looked for the fungal disease chytridiomycosis in other frogs that live nearby, but they did not find it. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
