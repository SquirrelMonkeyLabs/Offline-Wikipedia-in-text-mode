 "text": "Spree-Neiße (Lower Sorbian: Wokrejs Sprjewja-Nysa) is a Kreis (district) in the southern part of Brandenburg, Germany. The district-free city of Cottbus is completely surrounded by the district. To the east is Poland. The district was started in 1993 by joining the old districts Cottbus-Land, Forst, Guben and Spremberg. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms has four quarters, one for each of the old districts. The crayfish in the topleft symbolizes Cottbus- Land, and is also present in the coat of arms of the city of Cottbus. The lion in the topright is the symbol of the Kingdom of Bohemia, as Spremberg was owned by the Bohemian kings. The deer antler in the bottomright symbolizes Forst, and was taken from the coat of arms of the Lords of Biberstein. The crown in the bottomleft represents the kings of Bohemia again, but this time symbolizing Guben. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Ämter #Drebkau #Forst, Lausitz #Guben #Spremberg #Welzow Amt-free municipalities #Kolkwitz #Neuhausen/Spree #Schenkendöbern 1\\.
