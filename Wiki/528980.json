 "text": "The List of Essential Medicines is a listing of drugs compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO). The medicines on the list cover the basic needs of a society, and they should be affordable and easy to get, according to the WHO. The list was first published in 1977. It is reviewed every two years. In 2023, the WHO published the 23rd version of its List of Essential Medications. == Contents == The 2023 version of the List includes 30 categories of essential medications: # Anesthetics and medical gases like oxygen, propofol, lidocaine, and midazolam # Pain medicines like aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, morphine, and fentanyl # Anti-allergy medicines like epinephrine # Antidotes like atropine and naloxone (prescribed in the United States as Narcan) # Medicines for diseases of the nervous system, including anti-seizure drugs and anti-Parkinson's drugs like levodopa # Anti-infective medications, including antibiotics, anti-fungals, and antivirals # Anti-migraine medicines like sumatriptan # Anti-cancer drugs like methotrexate and tamoxifen # Ready- to-use therapeutic food # Medicines affecting the blood, including blood thinners like warfarin # Blood products # Cardiovascular medicines to treat heart rhythm problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart failure # Medicines to treat skin problems, like calamine and hydrocortisone # Medicines used for diagnosis (like certain eyedrops) # Antiseptics and disinfectants like alcohol-based sanitizers # Diuretics like furosemide and spironolactone # Medicines for gastrointestinal problems like ulcers, vomiting, and diarrhea # Medicines for endocrine disorders, including estrogens and insulin # Immunological medicines including vaccines, anti- rabies antibodies, antivenom, and diphtheria antitoxin # Muscle relaxants like vecuronium # Medicines for eye problems like infections and glaucoma # Medicines for reproductive health and perinatal care, including contraceptives # Peritoneal dialysis solution # Medicines for mental and behavioral disorders like depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and addictions (the list includes nicotine replacement therapy, methadone for opioid addiction, and naltrexone for alcohol addiction) # Medicines for respiratory problems like asthma and COPD # Medicines to correct dehydration and electrolyte problems, like oral rehydration salts # Vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, calcium, riboflavin, thiamine, and iodine # Ear, nose, and throat medicines # Medicines for joint problems like gout # Dental medicines like fluoride === Recommendations === The List also recommends which drugs should be used first to treat certain problems. For example, in its section on anti-infective medications, the List recommends using doxycycline as the first-choice treatment for cholera. == Concerns == There are two major problems with the list: First, there are a number of diseases which mainly occur in developing countries. Many people there cannot afford to pay high prices for drugs, which means pharmaceutical companies are not interested in developing new drugs for such diseases. Examples for such diseases are malaria or tuberculosis. The second problem is that certain drugs on the list are patented, and they are often expensive. Examples for the second kind of drugs are those used to treat AIDS. According to a study done by the world bank, about a third of the world's population does not have access to these drugs.Priorities in Health.
