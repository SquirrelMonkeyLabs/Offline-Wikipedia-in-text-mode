 "text": "Their name liveth for evermore is a phrase from the King James Bible. It is the second half of chapter 44, verse 14 of Ecclesiasticus. It has been written on many war memorials since World War I. The full quote is \"Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth for evermore.\" Rudyard Kipling asked for the entire verse 14 to be written on the war memorials. Kipling also suggested the phrase \"Known unto God\" for gravestones marking the resting place of unidentified soldiers. == References == Category:English words and phrases",
