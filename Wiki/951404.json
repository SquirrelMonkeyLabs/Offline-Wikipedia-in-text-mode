 "text": "The Hong Kong Parliament Electoral Organizing Committee (Traditional Chinese: 香港議會選舉籌備委員會; short form: HKPEOC/香港議會籌委會) is made up of some Hong Kong people on the run. Two of them, Victor Ho and Elmer Yuen told the public on 27 July 2022 in Canada's Toronto that it had been formed. They said that it was trying to roll the Hong Kong Parliament (short form: HK Parliament/HKP; Traditional Chinese: 香港議會) out in 2023, by letting Hong Kong people vote fairly. On 3 August 2022, Hong Kong's Security Bureau said that doing the above was wrong, such that the group's Baggio Leung, Elmer Yuen and Victor Ho were now wanted by the Hong Kong Police Force for acting against the People's Republic of China's government in this way. On 8 August 2022, Radio Free Asia wrote that Elmer Yuen had said that secret agents of the Communist Party of China had been telling him scary things to try to stop his work on that. ==Reference== ==Website== *Hong Kong Parliament Electoral Organizing Committee – Hong Kong Parliament Electoral Organizing Committee * Hong Kong Parliament 香港議會 Category:Parliaments Category:Organisations based in Hong Kong Category:Unicameral legislatures",
