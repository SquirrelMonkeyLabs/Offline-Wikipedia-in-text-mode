Right now, the champion is Jacy Jayne, who is in her first reign. She defeated Stephanie Vaquer on the May 27, 2025, episode of NXT in Orlando, Florida. ==History== The title was introduced at WrestleMania Axxess on April 5, 2013. On the May 30 tapings of WWE NXT, Stephanie McMahon announced that there would be a tournament between four developmental talents and four main roster Divas. Paige defeated Emma in the tournament finals to become the first NXT Women's champion. After Paige debuted on the main roster and won the WWE Divas Championship, she held both championships. On the April 24, 2014 episode of NXT, NXT Commissioner JBL stripped Paige of the NXT Women's Championship because of her not being able to defend the NXT Women's Championship as the WWE Divas Champion. Another tournament was started the following week. Sasha Banks would qualify over Bayley, Natalya would qualify over Layla, Alexa Bliss would qualify over Alicia Fox and Charlotte would qualify over the former number-one contender, Emma. During the semifinals, Natalya defeated Sasha Banks, and Charlotte defeated Alexa Bliss. At NXT TakeOver, the finals took places and Charlotte defeated Natalya to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. ==Title history== == Combined reigns == As of , . † Is the current champion ¤ The exact length of at least one title reign is unknown, the shortest length is listed Rank Wrestler No. of reigns Combined days Combined days rec. by WWE 1 2 549 548 2 1 510 522 3 1 413 4 2 385 384 5 2 ¤331 321 6 1 308 273 7 1 304 8 1 223 9 1 202 201 10 1 192 191 11 1 165 164 12 1 140 139 13 1 14 1 ¤98 108 15 1 78 16 1 71 17 1 63 18 1 42 19 1 31 20 † 1 + == References == == Other websites == * Official NXT Women's Championship title history Category:World Wrestling Entertainment championships Category:2013 establishments in the United States",
