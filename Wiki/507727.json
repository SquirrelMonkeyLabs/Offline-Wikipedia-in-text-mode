The Lieutenant Governor is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, with the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada. Manitoba has a unicameral legislature, which is called the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. It has fifty-seven members, who are elected from single-member districts (meaning that only one member is elected from each district). The largest party in the legislature forms the executive branch.
