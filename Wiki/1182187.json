Scientists saw the frog between 10 and 800 meters above sea level. ==Young== The male frogs sit in groups on branches a little above the dead leaves on the ground and call to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves. The tadpoles grow in the nest. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Its home is big and human beings do not go there much. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
