 "text": "The Nepal flying frog, large tree frog, GÃ¼nther's tree frog, yellow-spotted tree frog, emerald gliding tree frog or white-lipped tree frog (Zhangixalus smaragdinus) is a frog. It lives in China, Nepal, India, Tibet, Bhutan, and Myanmar. This frog lives in trees. Most of the time, this frog lives high in the place where the branches come together like a roof. People have seen this frog between 500 and 2000 meters above sea level. The female frog makes a foam nest on top of the water in a pond. The tadpoles swim in the pond. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. Some people catch this frog to eat. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve, Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve, Royal Manas National Park, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, Thong Pha Phum National Park, Kaeng Krachan National Park, and Kui Buri National Park. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
