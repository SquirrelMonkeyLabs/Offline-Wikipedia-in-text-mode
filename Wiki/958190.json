 "text": "Bloons TD 6 is a 2018 tower defense video game. It is the sixth game in the Bloons TD series. It was developed and published by Ninja Kiwi. It was first released in June 2018 for iOS and Android. The game was later ported onto Steam. It was first released on Microsoft Windows in December 2018. It was released on macOS in March 2020. It was added to Apple Arcade on February 11, 2022, as Bloons TD 6+. ==How to play== In Bloons TD 6, the player creates a defense to pop all of the enemy balloons. These enemy balloons are called \"Bloons\", which must be destroyed by popping them with Monkeys. Cash is spent to buy Monkeys and their upgrades. Popping Bloons rewards cash to spend on more defense. If the Bloons reach the exit, they will cause the player to lose lives. Every round, Bloons are sent in waves. Rounds become increasingly harder, as the Bloons become increasingly stronger. Some Bloons may gain special properties, making them resistant to certain types of Monkeys. Monkeys can be used to create a defense that is designed to defend against the Bloons. Most of the Monkeys can harm the bloons, which are capable of dealing damage. Some of the Monkeys can support other Monkeys or produce extra income. Some examples of Bloons include: The Red Bloon, which can be 1-shot by every offense tower in Bloons TD 6 The Blue Bloon which when hit, turns into a Red Bloon and if hit by a projectile that does 2 damage or more, it will get 1-shot The Green Bloon which is like the Blue Bloon, but with a green layer on top which takes 1 damage to pop, so it can be 1-shot if hit by a projectile that does 3 damage or more. There are many more Bloons to discover, but youâ€™ll have to discover those on your own. == References == Category:2018 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video game sequels Category:Xbox One games",
