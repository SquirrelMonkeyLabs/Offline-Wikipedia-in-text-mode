 "text": "The ambush at Bergen op Zoom took place on September 4, 1643 during the Eighty Years' War. The ambush became mainly known because it was the first military action of William II of Orange. The cavalry commander Krok and stadtholder Frederick Henry had made an agreement to involve the stadtholder's son William II of Orange in this action, but only if this action could go well. Krok went to Flanders with his cavalry and there came to a clash with the Army of Flanders (Spaniards) under Juan de Borgia. Krok soon discovered that the Spaniards were in the majority and withdrew. He hoped that the Spaniards would give chase. This also happened and Krok managed to lure them into an ambush near Bergen op Zoom. The troops led by William II of Orange managed to kill 500 soldiers and capture about a hundred prisoners. William was applauded throughout the country for his action. == Related pages == * Eighty Years' War * William II, Prince of Orange == Source == * Dedallo Carasso: Helden van het vaderland.
