 "text": "In probability and statistics, Poisson distribution is a probability distribution. It is named after Sim√©on Denis Poisson. It measures the probability that a certain number of events occur within a certain period of time. The events need to be unrelated to each other. They also need to occur with a known average rate, represented by the symbol \\lambda (lambda). More specifically, if a random variable X follows Poisson distribution with rate \\lambda, then the probability of the different values of X can be described as follows: :P(X=x)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^x}{x!} for x = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots Examples of Poisson distribution include: * The numbers of cars that pass on a certain road in a certain time * The number of telephone calls a call center receives per minute * The number of light bulbs that burn out (fail) in a certain amount of time * The number of mutations in a given stretch of DNA after a certain amount of radiation * The number of errors that occur in a system * The number of Property & Casualty insurance claims experienced in a given period of time == Related pages == * Binomial distribution * Exponential distribution == References == Category:Probability distributions",
