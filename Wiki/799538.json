 "text": "Norman Vigil Osborn, also known as the Green Goblin, is the main villain of the 2002-2007 Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies and based on the Marvel Comics character Norman Osborn / Green Goblin. He was played by Willem Dafoe in all three movies and the first tie-in video game. Dafoe reprised his role in the 2021 movie Spider-Man: No Way Home. ==Background== The designers wanted a more comic-accurate design for his suit, but many considered the mask too creepy, so they went with the helmet seen in the movie. ==Fictional character biography== Norman Osborn is the CEO of OSCORP and father of Harry Osborn, the best friend of Peter Parker. After being pressured by the American government to complete a project for them, Norman tests the project – a drug that is supposed to turn people into super-powered soldiers – on himself, turning himself into the crazy, evil Green Goblin and developing a split personality. After Peter becomes Spider-Man, he battles the Goblin several times. Norman eventually finds out Peter's secret identity, then attacks Peter's Aunt May and crush Mary-Jane Watson to try to bait him. Peter, as Spider-Man, manages to defeat the Goblin before Norman reveals himself. Despite finding out his best friend's dad is the Goblin, Peter refuses to work with Norman, who then tries to kill Peter but ends up killing himself instead. Harry then thinks Spider-Man killed his father, not knowing about the bad things Norman did as the Green Goblin until later in the movie series. ==Reception== Willem Dafoe's portrayal has been well-liked and considered one of the best movie supervillains of all time despite his design. == Appearances == === Movie appearances === Year Movie Portrayed by 2002 Spider-Man Willem Dafoe 2004 Spider-Man 2 2007 Spider-Man 3 2021 Spider-Man: No Way Home ==References== Category:Fictional business executives Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2002 Category:Marvel Comics mutates Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:Spider-Man (2002 movie series) Category:Spider-Man movie characters Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters Category:Marvel Comics movie characters Category:Video game bosses",
