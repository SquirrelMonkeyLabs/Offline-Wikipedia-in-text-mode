 "text": "The United States Revenue Cutter Service (USRCS) was set up in 1790 when President George Washington signed an act allowing the building of 10 boats. They were designed to collect customs duties and taxes and to protect against smuggling. They were also tasked with making sure shipments of goods from the United States were getting through to markets in other countries. In 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed the \"Act to Create the Coast Guard\". This designated the United States Coast Guard as a branch of the US military. It was formed by merging the Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life- Saving Service. == History == Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury suggested the creation of the Revenue Cutter Service in a letter dated October 2, 1789.Horatio Davis Smith, Early History of the United States Revenue Marine Service, ed. Elliot Snow (Washington, DC: Coast Guard Bicentennial Publication, 1989), p. 1 After being approved by Congress, the service started with 10 boats called cutters. At the time a cutter was a small fast sailing vessel described as \"a small, decked ship with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail.\" The Oxford Companion to Ships & the Sea, ed. Peter Kemp (London: Oxford University Press, 1976), pp. 221-222 Before the Revenue Cutter Service began, the Continental Navy had been disbanded.John Hamilton, The Coast Guard (Edina, MN: ABDO Publishing, 2007), p. 8 Until the United States Navy was formed in 1794, the Revenue Cutter Service was the nation's only naval force. After the American Revolutionary War, the United States was struggling financially. The new country depended on the money it received from import tariffs. Smuggling had been seen as a patriotic duty during the war, but was now a robbing the country of one of its major sources of revenue. Hamilton realized that if something was not done quickly, the country would suffer financially. He suggested that a fleet of 10 cutters could collect revenues and prevent smuggling. The original specifications stated they were to be between and long.Worth G. Ross, 'Our Coast Guard: A Brief History of The United States Revenue Marine Service ', Harper's New Monthly Magazine Vol. 73, Iss. 438 (November 1886), p. 3 Each would be manned by two officers, six marines and crews of about 10 men and boys. === First 10 cutters === Although it was not one of the first 10 cutters called for by Hamilton, the North Carolina was purchased in 1792 for use by the Revenue Marine Service. Before the first 10 were approved a number of vessels were used as revenue boats, some as early as the confederation period (March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789). The first 10 cutters built were: * USRC Vigilant (1791) was launched in March 1791 in New York and was used to patrol New York waters. Patrick Dennis was her first master. In November of 1798, the first ship named Vigilant was sold. * USRC Active (1791) was built by the shipwright David Stodder in Baltimore, Maryland.Paul H. Silverstone, The Sailing Navy, 1775-1854 (London; New York: Routledge, 2006), p. 77 It was launched on April 9, 1791 and was based in Baltimore. USRC Active was used to patrol the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Her first master was Simon Gross. The first cutter named Active was sold in 1800. * USRC General Green (1791) was launched at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 7 July 1791. She was built by shipwright David Price and stationed in the Delaware Bay. Her first master was James Montegomery. The first General Green was sold in December, 1797. * USRC Massachusetts (1791) was built at Cohasset, Massachusetts by shipwright Adna Bates. On July 15, 1791 it was launched. Like several others, she was larger than the original specifications. She was long by wide and had a draft of . John Foster Williams was its first master. Massachusetts was sold on October 9, 1792. * USRC Scammel (1791) was launched on August 24, 1791 at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She was long by wide and had a draft of . Her first master was Hopley Yeaton and she was sold on August 16, 1798. * USRC Argus (1791) was built and launched in 1791 at New London, Connecticut where she remained stationed. Jonathan Maltbie was her first master and the first Argus was sold in 1804. Argus was long by wide and had a draft of . * USRC Virginia (1791) was built and launched in 1791 at Hampton, Virginia. She was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia. Richard Taylor was her first master and the first Virginia was sold in 1798. At long by wide with a draft of , Virginia was built to the original specifications. * USRC Diligence (1791) was built at Washington, North Carolina and launched there in either June or July of 1792. William Cook was her first master; the first Diligence was sold in 1798. * USRC South Carolina (1791) was built at Charleston, South Carolina and launched in 1792. She was stationed out of Charleston and patrolled North Carolina waters. Robert Cochrane was her first master. On June 5, 1798, the first South Carolina was sold. * USRC Eagle was built and launched at Savannah, Georgia in 1793 and patrolled Georgia waters. John Howell was the name of her first master. The first Eagle was sold on September 14, 1799.

The conflict was fought at sea from July 7, 1798, until the Treaty of Mortefontaine was signed on September 30, 1800. However, French privateers had been robbing American ships for several years before the Quasi-War began. American merchant ships were also being attacked by barbary pirates. USRC cutters were sent to deal with the pirates but soon the combination of French privateers and pirates were more than the service could handle alone. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 which established a permanent standing navy. The Naval Act ordered the construction and manning of six frigates. Three years later the first three ships were welcomed into the U.S. Navy. As the Quasi-War heated up, both the Navy and Revenue Cutter Service worked together to protect American ships. Revenue Cutters were first sent to the Caribbean Sea to protect American shipping from French warships in the spring of 1799.Horatio Davis Smith, Early History of the United States Revenue Marine Service, ed. Elliot Snow (Washington, DC: Coast Guard Bicentennial Publication, 1989), pp. 17–20 About 12 French warships were captured by Revenue cutters in 1799 in the Caribbean. Of these, the 6-gun Bon Perre, captured by the USRC Eagle, was put into service as a Revenue cutter and served until 1801. In 1800, the brigantine Pickering and the frigate Insurgente both departed the East Coast to join the fleet in the Caribbean. Both were lost at sea. There were no survivors to explain what happened to the two cutters. On February 3, 1801 the treaty with France was ratified. At this time many in Washington, D.C. thought that the Revenue Cutter Service should be reduced in size. Many of its larger cutters were too big and too expensive to maintain. Many of the larger and older cutters were sold and many junior officers were let go. === War of 1812 === When the war started, the Navy only had six vessels smaller than a frigate. None of these were the \"small fast sailing ships\" the cutters were. The shallow-draft cutters suffered significant losses but managed to distinguish themselves as a fighting force. The cutter Jefferson captured the first British merchant ship, the Patriot, in June 1812. In July the cutter James Madison captured the British ship Shamrock. In one battle, the cutter Surveyor put up such a fight against the larger British frigate HMS Narcissus, that when the Surveyor finally surrendered, The British Captain returned the sword of the American captain in recognition of his bravery. The cutter Commodore Barry was captured by British forces after putting up a strong defense. In one incident, the cutter Eagle was run aground during a battle with a British brig, the HMS Dispatch and a British sloop that was with her. The cutter's crew dragged the cutter's guns onto a bluff and kept fighting until late in the day. When they ran out of shot, they began firing back the spent British cannonballs (according to the legend). The War of 1812 saw the only USRCS prisoners of war taken by an enemy until World War II. The War proved the USRCS could hold their own against even the greatest naval force of the time. === Mexican–American War === During the Mexican–American War, President James K. Polk ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to have cutters in the Gulf of Mexico report to the United States Army (instead of the Navy).Robert J. Lloyd, Serving in Obscurity: United States Revenue Cutter Service Operations in the Gulf of Mexico During the Mexican American War 1846-1847 (master’s thesis, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, May 2007), pp. vii, 27–33 By the end of the war, eight cutters had served with the Army. This was out of a total fleet of only 14 cutters. They had capabilities the Navy (or Army) did not have. This was boats that could operate in shallow water and be used for amphibious landings. The Revenue cutters served on blockade duty, ferried men and supplies and supported Army and Navy operations. On October 8, 1847, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury informed his commanders that the service was low on funds.Horatio Davis Smith, Early History of the United States Revenue Marine Service, ed. Elliot Snow (Washington, DC: Coast Guard Bicentennial Publication, 1989), pp. 78–80 The expenses of operating in Mexico had reduced funds to a new low. The service needed to cut back on new ships and retire those too expensive to keep running. The USRCS was reduced to eight cutters. By 1849, six new cutters had been ordered but between the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Florida, there were only two cutters. One more served in the Gulf of Mexico. Two of the new cutters, when they became available, would serve in the Atlantic while four would serve on the West Coast. === Civil War === Just before the start of the American Civil War the Revenue Cutter Service had just 24 cutters to guard both coasts of the United States.Florence Kern, The United States Revenue Cutters in the Civil War (Bethesda, MD: Alised Enterprises, c.1990), pp. 11–12 Of these, 23 were wooden sailing ships ranging in length of from to . All but one were either fore-and-aft rigged sloops or topsail schooners. The remaining cutter was a brig. The service also owned one modern (for that time) wooden paddle steamer measuring in length, the USRC Harriet Lane built in 1857-1858. The Harriet Lane was the pride of the Revenue Cutter Service. It was also the only cutter that had a full crew. The rest of the fleet barely had enough officers and men to operate the ships. Cutbacks in funding during the 1840s and 1850s and no pay raises left the service short of men. During this same period, the service began winter patrols in the North Atlantic Ocean to protect sailors. They also took on the task of enforcing immigration laws, especially on the West Coast where large numbers of Chinese coolies were being brought in on overcrowded ships. At the start of the war a small number of officers and men left the service to join the Confederacy and formed the core of the Confederate Revenue Marine. Six cutters had been seized by Confederate forces while in Southern ports.Florence Kern, The United States Revenue Cutters in the Civil War (Bethesda, MD: Alised Enterprises, c.1990), pp. 46–52 The Harriet Lane was temporarily transferred to the Union Navy. President Abraham Lincoln requested the Navy to transfer a number of ships to the Revenue Cutter Service, however no records show if any were actually transferred. During the remainder of the war, Revenue cutters protected Northern shipping and assisted the Navy in blockading Southern ports.Snow Wildsmith, Joining the United States Coast Guard: A Handbook (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 2012), p. 52 The cutter Harriet Lane fired the first shots of the Civil War from a ship. But in 1863, in a battle with the Confederate Army and Navy, the Harriet Lane was captured and nearly all the crew members were killed. === Spanish–American War === On April 21, 1898, the United States declared war against Spain. President William McKinley temporarily transferred the ships of the Revenue Cutter Service to operate under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy. They were ordered to cooperate with the Navy and became part of their auxiliary forces. The Revenue Cutter Service provided 13 cutters to assist the Navy. Eight served in the North Atlantic Squadron, four patrolled the West Coast and one served with Admiral George Dewey's Asiatic Squadron. == United States Coast Guard == Together, the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service formed the United States Coast Guard on 28 January 1915. The law made the Coast Guard a permanent member of the United States military and allowed it to be transferred to the U.S. Navy whenever necessary. The practice of placing the Revenue Cutter Service under control of the Navy in times of crisis had been the custom in the past. But now it was made official by the new law which also changed its name. == Notes == == References == == Other websites == * Alexander Hamilton Letter to the Revenue Cutter Service; YouTube * U.S. Revenue Marine and the War of 1812; YouTube Category:Military of the United States Category:1790 establishments in the United States Category:1915 disestablishments in the United States",
