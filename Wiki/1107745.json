 "text": "Players position themselves in the best spot to get the rebound by \"boxing out\"â€”i.e., by positioning themselves between an opponent and the basket, and maintaining body contact with the player he is guarding. The action can also be called \"blocking out\". A team can be boxed out by several players using this technique to stop the other team from rebounding. Because fighting for a rebound can be very physical, rebounding is often regarded as \"grunt work\" or a \"hustle\" play. Overly aggressive boxing out or preventing being boxed out can lead to personal fouls. == Statistics == Dennis rodman is considered the rebounding GOAT, while Kevin Garnett has the most rebounds all time.
