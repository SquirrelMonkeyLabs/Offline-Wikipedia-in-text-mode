 "text": "The Republic of Ireland – United Kingdom border is the border that separates the constituent British nation of Northern Ireland from the rest of Ireland. It is also known as the Irish Border or simply as the border. It was drawn on December 6, 1922 by the Anglo-Irish Treaty, by which 26 of the 32 Irish counties seceded from the United Kingdom and formed the Irish Free State. However, the United Kingdom retained sovereignty over the remaining 6 counties, which are now an integral part of the United Kingdom. == References == Category:Geography of Ireland Category:Borders",
