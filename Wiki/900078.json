At 923 ft (284m) above sea level, it is about 227 ft (70m) above the river. Many new houses have been built, except in the old village center, due to the great view into the valley. The expansion largely took place to the west towards Schonungen. ==References== ==Other websites== *Information about Forst- In German Category:Villages in Bavaria Category:Schweinfurt (district)",
