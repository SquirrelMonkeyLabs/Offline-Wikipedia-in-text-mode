 "text": "Louder Than Love is the second full-length album by the American grunge band Soundgarden. It was released on September 5, 1989 through A&M; Records. After touring in support of its first full-length studio album, Ultramega OK, released in 1988, the band signed with A&M; and began work on its first album for a major label. The songs on the album featured a heavy rock sound with some songs featuring unusual or unorthodox time signatures. Because of some of the song lyrics the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album's release, including the addition of a Parental Advisory sticker on the album packaging. Louder Than Love would become the band's first album to chart on the Billboard 200. The band supported the album with tours of North America and Europe. It was the last Soundgarden album to feature the band's original bassist, Hiro Yamamoto. ==Track listing== All songs written by Chris Cornell, except where noted: #\"Ugly Truth\" – 5:26 #\"Hands All Over\" (Cornell, Kim Thayil) – 6:00 #\"Gun\" – 4:42 #\"Power Trip\" (Cornell, Hiro Yamamoto) – 4:09 #\"Get on the Snake\" (Cornell, Thayil) – 3:44 #\"Full on Kevin's Mom\" – 3:37 #\"Loud Love\" – 4:57 #\"I Awake\" (Kate McDonald, Yamamoto) – 4:21 #\"No Wrong No Right\" (Cornell, Yamamoto) – 4:47 #\"Uncovered\" – 4:30 #\"Big Dumb Sex\" – 4:11 #\"Full On (Reprise)\" – 2:42 ==Personnel== *Chris Cornell – vocals, guitar *Kim Thayil – guitar *Hiro Yamamoto – bass *Matt Cameron – drums *Terry Date – production, engineering *Soundgarden – production *Stuart Hallerman, Jack Endino, Nelson Ayres – studio assistance *Steve Thompson, Michael Barbiero – mixing *Howie Weinberg – mastering *Art Chantry – design & art execution *Bruce Pavitt – Third Eye/Front Cover *Charles Peterson, Michael Lavine – photography ==Chart positions== ;Album Year Chart Position 1990 US Billboard 200 108 ;Singles Year Single Chart Position 1990 \"Hands All Over\" UK Singles Chart 82 \"Loud Love\" UK Singles Chart 87 ==References== ==Other websites== * Louder Than Love on the Unofficial Soundgarden Homepage Category:1989 albums Category:Soundgarden albums Category:A&M; Records albums",
