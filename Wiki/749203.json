Translated by Leanne Ross. Sharyhina and her partner, Vira Chemygina, have been part of the Ukrainian LBGT community and lesbian organizations for years. They organized Kyiv's first walks for equality. The second walk for equality in Kyiv was held in 2015. Police officers and public figurs supported the walk. However, the walk only lasted for 15 minutes because of the violence against the marchers. Ten people, including police officers guarding the event, were injured.Clara Marchaud, Kyiv Pride week events to raise awareness, defend LGBTQ rights, Kyiv Post, June 8, 2018. ==References== Category:1978 births CAtegory:Living people Category:Lesbian feminists Category:LGBT rights activists Category:Ukrainian activists",
