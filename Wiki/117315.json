 "text": "Saare Jahan se Achcha is a poem. It was re-written in 1931. It became a symbol of resistance to the English rule of British-occupied India. The poem exists in different versions. Saare Jahan Se Achchha () is one of the enduring patriotic poems of the Urdu language. Written originally for children in the ghazal style of Urdu poetry by poet Muhammad Iqbal, the poem was published in the weekly journal Ittehad on 14 August 1931. Recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, now in Pakistan, it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British rule in India.

Translation Better than the entire world, is our Hindustan, We are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode If we are in an alien place, the heart remains in the homeland, Know us to be only there where our heart is. That tallest mountain, that shade-sharer of the sky, (It) is our sentry, (it) is our watchman In its lap frolic those thousands of rivers, Whose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise. O the flowing waters of the Ganges, do you remember that day When our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront? Religion does not teach us to bear ill-will among ourselves We are of Hind, our homeland is Hindustan. In a world in which ancient Yunan, Misr, and Roma have all vanished without trace Our own attributes (name and sign) live on today. Such is our existence that it cannot be erased Even though, for centuries, the cycle of time has been our enemy. Iqbal! We have no confidant in this world What does any one know of our hidden pain?
