 "text": "In medicine, ischaemia is when the blood supply is blocked or restricted. This is usually caused by problems in the blood vessels, and causes damage to the body. If blood supply problems damage an organ, digits or limbs (fingers, finger tips, toes, arms, legs) they become ischaemic. It may also be spelled ischemia ischæmia in some countries or writing. It comes from the Greek words, isch- to restrict and hema or haema meaning blood. Ischaemic heart disease (coronary heart disease) is the world’s biggest killer, responsible for 16% of the world’s total deaths. Since 2000, it has been responsible for the largest increase in deaths overall, rising by more than 2 million to 8.9 million deaths in 2019. When a part of the body isn't getting enough oxygen-rich blood, the skin may turn pale or blue (cyanosis). When the heart doesn't get blood it turns white, and this would be because there is no blood in it. Pale or blue skin may be an early warning sign of blood perfusion issues, blockages or restrictions. ==References== ==Other pages== *Anoxia/Hypoxia Category:Diseases and disorders of the cardiovascular system",
