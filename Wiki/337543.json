At the northern end is the Japanese island of Kyushu. At the southern end is the Pacific island nation of Palau.\"IHO-IOC GEBCO gazetter of undersea feature names,\" Publication B-8, January 2010, p236 ; retrieved 2012-4-8. The seabed ridge begins in an area about 900 km from the eastern end of the or \"Bungo strait\" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southeast in the direction of the island of Palau. There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.Kobayashi, K. \"Origin of the Palau and Yap trench-arc systems,\" Geophysical Journal International, Vol. 157, Issue 7, p. 1306. KPR is southeast of the Japanese island of Kyushu. ==History== KPR was created by movement at the northern edges of the Philippine Plate.Haraguchi, Satoru et al. \"The early Miocene (~25 Ma) volcanism in the northern Kyushu-Palau Ridge, enriched mantle source injection during rifting prior to the Shikoku backarc basin opening,\" Mineralogy and Petrology, Vol. 163, Issue 3, pp 483-504; excerpt, \"The northern Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR), remnant conjugate arc of the Izu-Ogasawara (Bonin)-Mariana (IBM) active arc ....\"; retrieved 2012-4-9. ==Related pages== * Saikaid≈ç Seamounts * Active volcano * Dormant volcano ==References== ==Other websites== * Wolfram Alpha, Kyushu-Palau Ridge Category:Pacific Ocean Category:Volcanoes of Asia",
