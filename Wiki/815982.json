 "text": "Sylvirana is a genus of frogs in the family Ranidae. They live in South and East Asia, from northeastern India in the west to China in the north, Taiwan in the east, and Thailand in the south. Sylvirana was proposed in 1992. At first, in scientists thought Sylvirana should be a subgenus of Rana. Since then, it has been considered both a genus of its own and a synonym of Hylarana. Scientists think it should be its own genus because of molecular genetic analyses published in 2015. ==Description== Frogs in Sylvirana are mostly medium sized with strong bodies. They have markings behind their eyes like frogs in Papurana. Their upper lips are gray, off-white, or mottled in color. The back is shagreened with spicules, or it can be warty. The folds of skin on the sides of their backs are medium sized and well developed. They are either pale or the same color as the back. The sides of their bodies have dark coloration below ridges that fade to pale and have dark spots with clear edges. Male frogs have paired vocal sacs that may be inside their bodies or outside their bodies. ==Species== There are 12 recognized species: ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
