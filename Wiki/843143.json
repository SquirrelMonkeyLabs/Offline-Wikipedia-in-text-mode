 "text": "The 2017 Mount Albert by-election was a New Zealand by-election held in the Mount Albert electorate on 25 February 2017 during the 51st New Zealand Parliament. The seat was vacated after the resignation of David Shearer, a former Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party. No all right and centre-right parties ran, and turnout was low. The electorate was won by Labour Party list MP Jacinda Ardern by a large margin. Another Labour member, Raymond Huo, filled Ardern's list seat. ==References== Category:2017 elections in New Zealand Category:February 2017 events Category:Jacinda Ardern",
