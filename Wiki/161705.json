 "text": "The Nintendo DSi is the third version of the Nintendo DS handheld. It was first announced in October 2008 and was available in Japan in November of the same year and worldwide in 2009/2010. Development of the DSi began in late 2006, shortly after the release of the DS Lite. A larger version of the DSi titled the Nintendo DSi XL was released in 2009/2010. ==Features== The DSi is about 12% thinner (2.6 mm) and the screen is about 17% bigger than the Nintendo DS Lite. It has two Video Graphics Array (or VGA) 0.3 megapixel digital cameras; one is pointed at the user and the other is in the outer shell. The power switch is now a power button like the original Nintendo DS instead of a switch and is moved to the bottom to make it harder to bump by accident. It no longer has a slot to play Game Boy Advance games in and one will not be able to play games such as Guitar Hero: On Tour on the DSi because the game requires the slot and the download games. ==Differences between the Nintendo DS Lite and Nintendo DSi== *Bigger Screen: The DSi Screen is one quarter of an inch bigger than the DS Lite screen. *Lighter: The DSi is 4 grams lighter than the DS Lite. *Battery Life: The battery lasts between 1â€“5 hours less than the DS Lite. *Extra memory: The Nintendo DSi has a SD card slot, on which photos and music can be stored. *No Game Boy Game Slot: The DSi cannot play Game Boy Advance games and DS games that require the use of the GBA slot; this caused disappointment when it came out. *Camera: The DSi has two cameras, one on the inside and one on the outside and the photos can be put on the SD card and later printed. *Music Player: The DSi has an AAC player, for playing music, much like an iPod does. *Internet: The DSi has an internet browser that cannot watch videos, but can do everything else. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Nintendo DSi website *Official Nintendo DSi website Category:Nintendo video game consoles Category:Handheld game consoles",
