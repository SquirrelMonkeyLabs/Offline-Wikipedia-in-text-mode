 "text": "\"Lullaby\" is a song by the English gothic rock band The Cure. It was released on 10 April 1989 and from their eighth album Disintegration. It was a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Norway and Spain. ==Track listing== The US-only single \"Fascination Street\" included the B-sides from the UK release of \"Lullaby\". Therefore, the US release needed some new B-sides. The two live cuts, \"Homesick\" and \"Untitled\", are from the limited edition live album Entreat, which was recorded during the Disintegration Tour. The song was remixed for single release, giving it more of an electronic feel. * 7-inch: Fiction / FISC 29 (UK) # \"Lullaby\" (remix) – 4:08 # \"Babble\" – 4:16 * 7-inch: Elektra / 7-69249 (US) # \"Lullaby\" (remix) # \"Homesick\" (live version) * also released on cassette (9 46924-9) * 12-inch: Fiction / ficx 29 (UK) # \"Lullaby\" (extended remix) # \"Babble\" # \"Out of Mind\" * 12-inch: Elektra / 0 66664 (US) # \"Lullaby\" (extended remix) # \"Homesick\" (live version) # \"Untitled\" (live version) * CD: Fiction / ficcd 29 (UK) # \"Lullaby\" (remix) # \"Babble\" # \"Out of Mind\" # \"Lullaby\" (extended remix) * gatefold 3\" CD * CD: Elektra / 9 66664-2 (US) # \"Lullaby\" (remix) # \"Lullaby\" (extended remix) # \"Homesick\" (live version) # \"Untitled\" (live version) == References == Category:1989 songs Category:The Cure songs Category:Gothic rock songs",
