Bush, was a convicted felon for tax fraud, and a confirmed bigamist. His wedding ceremonies drew criticism, especially when they involved members of other churches, such as the Roman Catholic bishop Emmanuel Milingo, and particularly because of the bizarre rituals they entailed, such as making followers drink wine mixed with his blood during the purification ceremony Moon died on 3 September 2012 of pneumonia and its complications. ==References== Category:Korean people Category:1920 births Category:2012 deaths",
