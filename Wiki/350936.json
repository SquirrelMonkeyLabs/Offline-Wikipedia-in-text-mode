 "text": "James Sidney Edouard, Baron Ensor (13 April 1860 - 19 November 1949) was a Flemish-Belgian painter and printmaker. He was an important influence on expressionism and surrealism. He lived in Ostend for most of his life. He was associated with the artistic group Les XX. ==Life== From 1877 to 1880, he attended the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. His only travels were three brief trips to Paris, London, and Holland.Farmer, John David (1976). Ensor. New York: George Braziller, p. 11 In 1895 his painting The Lamp Boy (1880) was acquired by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. He had his first solo exhibition in Brussels.Becks-Malorny, Ulrike (2000). James Ensor. Cologne: Taschen, p. 95 By 1920 he was the subject of major exhibitions. In 1929 he was named a Baron by King Albert. He was the subject of the Belgian composer Flor Alpaerts's \"James Ensor Suite\". In 1933 he was awarded the band of the Légion d'honneur. Against the advice of friends, he remained in Ostend during World War II despite the risk of bombardment. In his old age he was an honored figure among Belgians. His daily walk made him a familiar sight in Ostend. He died there after a short illness, on 19 November 1949. ==Work== His early works show domestic scenes with little color. Later he started to use brighter colors. His subjects became very imaginative. He painted carnivals, masks, puppets and skeletons.van Gindertael, Roger (1975). Ensor.
