 "text": "The Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi), or Bornean clouded leopard, is found on Sumatra and Borneo. It is a genetically distinct species, related to the Clouded leopard. It has now been filmed. The Sunda clouded leopard is the largest cat in Borneo, weighing around 12 to 25 kg (26 to 55 lb). The canine teeth are two inches long, which, in proportion, are longer than other living felines. Its tail, which may be as long as its body, helps it balance when running and jumping. In Borneo, they occur in lowland rainforest. In Sumatra, they appear to live more in hilly, montane areas. It is not known if there are still Sunda clouded leopards on the small Batu islands close to Sumatra. == Its taxonomy == In December 2006, the genus Neofelis was reclassified into two distinct species:Buckley-Beason V.A. et al 2006. Molecular evidence for species-level distinctions in Clouded Leopards. Current Biology 16 (23): 2371â€“2376. * Neofelis nebulosa from mainland Asia and * Neofelis diardi from Borneo and Sumatra The Sunda clouded leopard in each island is different enough to be a separate subspecies. == References == Category:Felines Category:Mammals of Asia",
