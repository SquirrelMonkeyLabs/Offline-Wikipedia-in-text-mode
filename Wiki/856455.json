 "text": "The 1932 United States presidential election was the 37th election in the history of the United States. It happened on November 8, 1932. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate who was the governor of New York, won the election, defeating the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover. Hoover was blamed for the Great Depression, and tried to ease it, but the Depression got worse. Roosevelt also had the advantage of name recognition, since he was the fifth cousin of the late Theodore Roosevelt. This election marked the start of a long period where Democrats controlled the White House, as Democrats would win the next five elections. It also marked the beginning of Roosevelt's 12 years and 1 month as president, the longest tenure of any president. == Candidates == === Democratic Party === * Franklin D.
