 "text": "Rabi crops are a type of crop grown in the winter and harvested in the spring in the South Asia. The word means spring in the Arabic language. == Overview == It is also called rabi harvest and spring harvest (also known as winter crop). The rabi crops are sown around mid-November, after the monsoon rains are over, and harvesting begins in April/May. The crops are grown either with rainwater that has percolated into the ground, or with irrigation. A good rain in winter spoils the rabi crop but is good for kharif crops. Normally wheat barley, mustard, sesame and peas are grown in India. Peas are harvested early, as they are ready early: Indian markets are flooded with green peas from January to March, peaking in February. Some of the example are: === Cereals === *wheat *oat *barley * maize === Seed plants === ; * alfalfa * linseed * sesame * cumin * coriander * mustard * fennel * Fenugreek * isabgol ; === Vegetables === *pea *chickpea *onion *tomato *potato == References == Category:Agriculture",
