 "text": "The yellow perch (Perca flavescens), commonly referred to as perch, striped perch, American perch, American river perch, or preacher, is a species of fish native to much of North America. The yellow perch are usually a yellow golden color with these olive-green stripes on the side of their bodies. It is closely related, and morphologically similar to the European perch, but this fish is not the type species. The yellow perch or Perca flavescens was caught in May 1865 in Bordentown, New Jersey by Dr. C. Abbot. It is the longest- standing record for a freshwater fish in North America. The life history of yellow perch shows that the females generally reach their maximum size faster, mature later on, and live longer than males. ==References== # Purchase, C. F., Collins, N.
