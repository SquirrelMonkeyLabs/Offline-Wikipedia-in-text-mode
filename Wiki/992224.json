Pulisic is known for his dribbling abilities and explosive speed. Because of this, he has been given the nickname \"Captain America\" by fans and other players. Pulisic began his career at German club Borussia Dortmund, where he quickly progressed through the team's youth academy, being in only 15 youth games. He was then promoted to the senior team in 2016, at the age of 17. He did not play a lot in his first season at the club, but then he started to play more games in the next season. He became a mainstay in Dortmund and won the 2016–17 DFB-Pokal. He finished second in the first Kopa Trophy which is given to the best player under age 21 in 2018. In January 2019, Pulisic was transferred to Chelsea that costed $73 million (£57.6 million) making him the most expensive North American player of all time. He began playing for the club in the 2019–20 season. He became the youngest Chelsea player to score a hat-trick, at 21 years old.With Chelsea, he won the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, 2021 UEFA Super Cup and 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, becoming the youngest Chelsea player and first American to score in the Champions League semi-finals and the first American to play in the Champions League final. Pulisic played for the United States at the under-15 and under-17 levels, before making his senior national team debut in March 2016 at age 17. He is the youngest player ever to captain the United States national team in the modern era. He helped the U.S. get to the final of the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup and won the first 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League. Individually, he has won a U.S. Soccer Young Male Athlete of the Year award and three U.S. Soccer Male Athlete of the Year awards. == Career statistics == === Club === Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National cup League cup Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Borussia Dortmund Bundesliga 9 2 0 0 — 3 0 — 12 2 Borussia Dortmund 2016–17 Bundesliga 29 3 4 1 — 10 1 — 43 5 Borussia Dortmund 2017–18 Bundesliga 32 4 1 0 — 8 0 1 1 42 5 Borussia Dortmund 2018–19 Bundesliga 20 4 3 2 — 7 1 — 30 7 Borussia Dortmund Total 90 13 8 3 — 28 2 1 1 127 19 Chelsea 2019–20 Premier League 25 9 2 1 2 0 4 1 1 0 34 11 2020–21 Premier League 27 4 6 0 0 0 10 2 — 43 6 2021–22 Premier League 22 6 4 0 3 0 7 2 2 0 38 8 2022–23 Premier League 24 1 0 0 1 0 5 0 — 30 1 Total 98 20 12 1 6 0 26 5 3 0 145 26 AC Milan 2023–24 Serie A 31 10 2 0 — 12 3 — 45 13 Career total 219 43 22 4 7 0 65 10 4 1 317 58 === International === Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals United States 2016 11 3 United States 2017 9 6 United States 2018 3 0 United States 2019 11 5 United States 2021 8 3 United States 2022 14 5 United States 2023 7 6 United States 2024 2 0 Total Total 65 28 :United States score listed first, score column indicates score after each Pulisic goal.
