 "text": "The longhorn beetles or long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae) are a family of beetles that have long antennae. The antennae may be longer than the beetles' body. Over 35,000 species have been described. The length of the antennae is an obvious feature of their body. Their long antennae sprout from tubercles on the face. Cerambycids with short antennae still have the tubercles. Otherwise they vary greatly in size, shape, sculpture, and colour. Many of the species are mimics of Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps). The rest are cryptically colored. The titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) from northeastern South America is often considered the largest insect (though not the heaviest, and not the longest including legs). Its maximum body length is just over . == References == == Other websites == * cerambycoidea.com * Photo gallery of word-wide long- horned beetles",
