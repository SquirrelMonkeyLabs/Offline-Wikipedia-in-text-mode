 "text": "Albert Arnold Gore Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is an American politician, businessman and environmentalist. He was the 45th vice president of the United States from 1993 to 2001 under Bill Clinton. Before becoming vice president, he was a junior U.S. senator from Tennessee from 1985 to 1993. He was also a U.S. representative from 1977 to 1983 and again from 1983 to 1985. He was chosen as the Democratic nominee of the 2000 United States presidential election, but lost the electoral college vote to Republican candidate George W. Bush because of Florida recount and the U.S. Supreme Court ruling a 5-4 favor of Bush. He was supposed to be president before the supreme court decision. Gore got more votes, though. After the election, Gore became an activist focusing on climate change. Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.Stefoff, Rebecca Al Gore: Fighting for a Greener Planet: Revised Edition 2009 Lerner Publications Company Minneapolis, Minnesota page 7 ==Early life== Albert Gore, Jr. was born at Columbia Hospital for Women in Washington, D.C. He is the second of two children. His father, Albert A. Gore Sr. was a Senator for Tennessee and congressman. His mother, Pauline LaFon Gore was one of the first women to have graduated from Vanderbilt University Law School. Gore is descended from Scots-Irish immigrants who first settled in Virginia in the mid-17th-century, and moved to Tennessee after the Revolutionary War.Turque, Inventing Al Gore, p. 8. At least two of these ancestors, Jacob Waggoner and Lewis Stunston, owned slaves. Gore was brought up in both Washington and Tennessee. His older sister was Nancy LaFon Gore, who was born in 1938, died of lung cancer in 1984. ==Political career== Gore was a Representative from 1977 to 1985 and a Senator from 1985 to 1993. In 1988 he ran for president for the first time, but lost to Michael Dukakis in the Democratic primary. In 1993, he became vice president to Bill Clinton. He ran for president in 2000, but lost to George W. Bush (many people still argue this). Even though he lost the race, Gore won in the popular vote by over 500,000 votes. ==After the vice presidency== He is a fighter for issues involving the environment. He released a movie in 2006 about global warming and climate change called An Inconvenient Truth, which was based on a slide show he had given to millions of people. In 2007, Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize which he shared with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ==Potential 2016 presidential campaign== Interest in having Gore run for the 2016 Presidential election arose in 2014 and again in 2015. Gore did not run in 2016 and has expressed no interest to run in future elections. ==Personal life== He currently lives in Nashville and was married to Tipper for 40 years. In June 2010, they filed for divorce. The Gores have 4 children and 2 grandchildren. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:American Nobel Prize winners Category:American war correspondents Category:Green thinkers Category:Webby Award winners Category:United States senators from Tennessee Category:United States representatives from Tennessee Category:Politicians from Washington, D.C.
