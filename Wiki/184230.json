In June 1991 Slovenia and Croatia declared independence, and the Yugoslav Wars began. By 1992 only Serbia and Montenegro still wanted a union. They made a new country called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Leaders around the world didn't agree it was the same as the old Yugoslavia. Montenegro left in 2005.
