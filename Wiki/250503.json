 "text": "Metta Sandiford-Artest (born Ronald William Artest Jr., November 13, 1979 ) is an American former basketball player. He played for the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA. Artest changed his name to Metta World Peace in 2011, and changed his name to Metta Sandiford-Artest in 2020. Artest was drafted out of St. John's University by the Chicago Bulls and was known primarily as a defensive stopper. Later, he played for the Indiana Pacers, where he was involved in one of the most vicious NBA fights of all-time., Malice in the Palace. After leaving Indiana in disgrace, he played briefly for a couple teams before settling with the Lakers and becoming the \"Robin\" to Kobe Bryant's \"Batman.\" Today Ron Artest is respected in the NBA for his loyalty, and his quality play for the Lakers shows that he was worthy of a second chance at an NBA career. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1979 births Category:African- American basketball players Category:Living people Category:Chicago Bulls players Category:Houston Rockets players Category:Indiana Pacers players Category:Los Angeles Lakers players Category:Sacramento Kings players Category:Sportspeople from New York City",
