 "text": "The Gahal Alignment was an Israeli political party from 1965 until the establishment of Likud in 1973. Gahal is an abbreviation for Gush Herut Liberalim, which is Hebrew for \"Freedom-Liberal Bloc\". It was created by Menachem Begin who was at the time the leader of the Herut Party when Begin decided to form an alliance with the Liberal Party of Israel. Gahal was fiscally conservative because the Liberals were and strongly in favour of security because Herut was. In 1973, Gahal joined with a number of other political parties including the Free Centre, the National List and the Greater Israel movement to become Likud under the leadership of Menachem Begin.
