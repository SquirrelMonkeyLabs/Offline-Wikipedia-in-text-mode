 "text": "Brightline West is an a future high-speed rail line in the United States. It will run from Las Vegas in Nevada to Rancho Cucamonga in California. At that station, passengers can connect with the Metrolink commuter rail, which can get people to Los Angeles. The high-speed rail line will also stop at Victor Valley and Hesperia. Construction on the line started on April 22, 2024. It will open in 2028. In December 2023, the United States Department of Transportation gave Brightline West $3 billion for the project. Brightline West plans to improve travel between Southern California and Las Vegas, a popular travel route. No passenger train service currently goes to Las Vegas. The main highway to go between those places is Interstate 15. It is often congested. The new line will mostly run next to or in the middle of Interstate 15. It will take about 2 hours to go its entire route. When the line starts operation, it will bring back passenger train service to Las Vegas. The last time Las Vegas had it was with the Amtrak Desert Wind train in the 1990s. It ran between Los Angeles and Las Vegas and stopped operations in 1997. == References == Category:Rail transport in the United States Category:Transport in California Category:Transport in Nevada Category:High-speed rail",
