It lives in Colombia. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.4 - 18.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 16.9 - 20.9 mm long. Adults have three stripes on each side of their bodies. The adults are brown in color with darker marks on the back and head. The front feet are dull yellow in color. Female frogs have yellow back legs too. There are dark brown marks on all the legs. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have water in the air. Scientists saw them during the day near streams and on dead leaves on the ground. People also see the frogs in fields where people grow amapola and marijuana. Scientists saw the frog between 400 and 900 meters above sea level. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in streams. At one point in its life, the tadpole can be 19.4 mm long. Their bodies are oval in shape. The tail is longer than the rest of the body. The nose is round. The skin is clear, and the guts can be seen. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. It can live on farms but the chemicals that farmers use to kill weeds and chemicals that farmers use to kill pests can get into the streams and water and hurt the tadpoles. People also change the places where the frog lives to make places for animals to eat grass. There are many coal mines where the frog lives too. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
