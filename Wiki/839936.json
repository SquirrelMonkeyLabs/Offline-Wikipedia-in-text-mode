 "text": "Floride Bonneau Calhoun (née Colhoun; February 15, 1792 – July 25, 1866) was the wife of prominent U.S. politician John C. Calhoun. She is best known for her leading role in the Petticoat affair, which occurred during her husband's service as vice president of the United States. In that role, Mrs. Calhoun led the wives of other Cabinet members in ostracizing Peggy Eaton, the wife of Secretary of War John Eaton, whom they considered a woman of low morals. The affair helped damage relations between John C. Calhoun and President Andrew Jackson, and effectively ended any legitimate chance of him becoming president of the United States. == Second Lady == Eight years later in 1825, she became Second Lady of the United States, following her husband's election as vice president, serving in that role until his resignation in 1832. She served from 1825 to 1832. Category:Second Ladies of the United States Category:1792 births Category:1866 deaths",
