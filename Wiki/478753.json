 "text": "An honor killing is a member of a family being killed by other members, because of the killers feeling that the victim has brought shame on the family. Reasons a woman could be targeted include refusing to enter an arranged marriage, having sex outside marriage, and being a victim of rape. Honor killings are associated with the Middle East and South Asia. They also happen in countries that have immigrants from those places. Murder is not the only honor crime. Acid attacks and beating are also done for the same reasons as honor killings. Victims of honor killings are mostly young women. In at least one European country, one of its largest NGOs has a help line in regard to honor-related violence.https://www.nrk.no/stor-oslo/barn-og-unge-blir- etterlatt-i-utlandet-av-familien-1.17056209.
