The protestors said that the elections, which had the ruling Georgian Dream win a majority of seats, was a fraud, and wanted a recount and a new election. The protests continued on 17 November, when the final results were certified by the Central Election Commission of Georgia. The protests grew larger a few weeks later on 28 November, when the government announced that it would postpone the EU negotiations process until 2028. ==References== Category:October 2024 events Category:November 2024 events Category:December 2024 events Category:2024 protests Category:2020s in Georgia (country) Category:January 2025 events Category:2024 in Europe Category:2024 in Asia Category:2025 in Europe Category:2025 in Asia Category:February 2025 events",
