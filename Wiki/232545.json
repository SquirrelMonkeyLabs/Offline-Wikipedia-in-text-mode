Demigod Percy Jackson, who is almost fifteen years old, tries to stop Luke and his army from invading Camp Half-Blood by navigating Daedalus's labyrinth. It was released on May 6, 2008 in the US and Canada. ==Synopsis== === Plot summary for the Book === After being attacked by Empousai cheerleaders at his new school, Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood and learns about \"The Labyrinth\", part of the palace of King Minos in Crete that, according to Greek mythology, was designed by Daedalus. During a battle game at the camp, Annabeth and Percy find an entrance into the Labyrinth. Percy soon learns that Luke had used the entrance and will lead his army through the Labyrinth straight in to the heart of Camp Half-Blood. To get into the Labyrinth, Percy has to find the Delta Symbol (Î”) on a passageway, touch it, and then enter the Labyrinth. Using the Labyrinth, Percy has to try to find Daedalus so Luke cannot get Ariadne's string, thereby foiling Luke's invasion. Ariadne's string is used to find all the exits of the Labyrinth. Grover comes to the rescue and causes a Panic to scare away the enemy. After the battle, Daedalus sacrifices himself to close the labyrinth, which is tied to his life. === Major characters === * Demigods: **Percy Jackson: 15 years old, son of Poseidon, God of the Sea. He is the series' narrator and protagonist. ** Annabeth Chase: 15 years old, Percy's friend, and daughter of Athena. Assists Percy when he as he navigates the labyrinth. By the end of the book they are very close friends. ** Rachel Elizabeth Dare: A mortal who can clearly see through the Mist. Her father is a rich businessman who buys the undeveloped land of the wild and builds developments upon them. She hates her father for doing so and was embarrassed to meet Pan, God of the Wild. Percy had previously met her lover at the lusit at the Hoover Dam in The Titan's Curse, where she helped him get away from the undead warriors. ** Nico di Angelo: Son of Hades.

Grover, Tyson, Percy, Annabeth, Nico and Rachel find Pan inside a crystal cavern along with some extinct animals. He gave them words of wisdom, and then died. When he died, his essence entered all of the characters' mouths, meaning a piece of the wild remained in their hearts. He gave Grover the famous battle cry, panic, which Grover used to scare off the intruders in Camp Half-Blood. The god Pan is named after panic because in the Titan war he let out a horrible cry that drove all the monsters back to where they came from. ** Tyson the Cyclops: Percy's cyclops half-brother. He now works for his father in the Palace of Poseidon under the oceans in the Cyclopes' Forge. Tyson enjoys forging, nicknaming mythical creatures they come across and eating peanut butter sandwiches.

Before he dies, he gives Annabeth a laptop containing all of the works he never had time to accomplish as well as many of his ideas and theories. ** Calypso: Because she helped her father Atlas, she is punished by a \"house arrest\" in an island named Ogygia. The Fates send her a hero that she falls in love with every thousand years or so. After Percy creates an explosion in Mount Saint Helen's, she nurses him back to health.
