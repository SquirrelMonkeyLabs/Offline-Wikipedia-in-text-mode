 "text": "Flashpoint Archive is a project to preserve games and animations playable on web browsers. Major web browsers can no longer run over 100,000 of them due to removing NPAPI support. An Australian, Ben Latimore, started it in 2018 as part of Archive Team. A program allows the collection, which is 900 gigabytes, to be used by simulating the Internet. It is named after and focused on Flash, but also supports Shockwave, Silverlight, Java, Unity Web Player and many more, as well as frameworks, such as ActiveX. 51 web technologies are preserved. It is not known if the project is legal, but creators can ask for their programs to be removed. Flashpoint has two main versions: Ultimate and Infinity. Ultimate has all games and animations from the start, while Infinity downloads their files when needed. There is also a Core version made for adding them, which has a tiny amount. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website Category:Free software",
