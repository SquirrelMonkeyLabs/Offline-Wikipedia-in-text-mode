 "text": "\"We Think It's Love\" is a 2000 debut single from Australian singer Leah Haywood and is the leading single from her debut studio album Leah. It went to number 7 in Australia and did not chart in neighbouring New Zealand despite airplay on pop radio stations at the time. ==Track listings== The single was released in three formats. It was first released as a digipak single where it housed a special \"clear disc\" and then later in a slimline jewel-case packaging which came with bonus stickers of Haywood and other \"Sony\" music label artistes and an enhanced multimedia screensaver section on the disc. It was finally released on a 12-inch vinyl which contained two remixes that were unavailable on either CD single releases. Both CD releases contain the ballad B-side track \"...And If I Could\", which never appeared on the album. The track was co-written and co-produced by Haywood and Sydney music producer Barbara Griffin.
