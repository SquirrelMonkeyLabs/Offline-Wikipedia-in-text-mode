 "text": "Alexander \"Killer\" Kaleta (November 29, 1919 â€“ July 9, 1987) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger. He played 7 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers organizations. Kaleta is known for creating the hat trick tradition in hockey when he went into a Toronto shop to buy a hat but when he found one he liked he could not afford it. The shop owner made a deal with Kaleta and said that if he scored 3 goals in the next game he played he would just give him the hat free of charge. Kaleta not only scored three goals but four against the Toronto Maple Leafs. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1919 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey left wingers Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Ice hockey people from Alberta Category:New York Rangers players",
