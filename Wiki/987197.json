Ocasek sang lead vocals. ==Music video== The music video for the song shows many different personas of people at a party as Ocasek walks on the pool water singing the song. The Cars filmed \"Magic\" at the Hilton family house in Beverly Hills. Kathy Hilton rented the house for her band. A Plexiglass platform was located below the surface of the water. In the first take, the platform collapsed. The platform had to be adjusted for Ric's weight. The house is also the setting for the movie Blind Date starring Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== 1984 weekly chart performance for \"Magic\" Chart (1984) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 96 US Cash Box Top 100 Singles 16 2019 weekly chart performance for \"Magic\" Chart (2019) Peak position US Rock Digital Song Sales (Billboard) 13 ===Year-end charts=== Year- end chart performance for \"Magic\" Chart (1984) Position US Billboard Hot 100 97 ==References== Category:The Cars songs Category:1984 songs",
