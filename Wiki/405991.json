 "text": "Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a sexual condition featuring the lack of sexual fantasy and desire for sexual activity. For this to be diagnosed, the condition has to cause strong distress or interpersonal troubles. It should also not be better accounted for by another mental disorder or drugs. The condition was discovered around the late 1960s or early 1970s. The subtypes include those previously having romantic interests in their partners, but which has since faded away. In some cases, sexual partners, men or women, may have never had sexual desire to begin with. The condition may be triggered by other health problems. Category:Sexual disorders",
