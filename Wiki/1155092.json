 "text": "A belly fetish is a kind of fetish where a person is attracted to the belly or abdominal region of another person, often a woman. == Description == A person with a belly fetish might feel aroused at the sight of seeing another person's abdominal area, especially if the belly button is uncovered. == Causes == Some doctors and scientists presume that a belly fetish may be caused by the increasing trend of women wearing clothing that exposes their belly, like for example, crop tops. The movements in the art of belly dancing have been considered to be seductive and hence may play a part in why people are attracted to the belly or abdominal region. == Related pages == *Sexual fetishism *Vorarephilia == References == Category:Sexual fetishism Category:Paraphilias",
