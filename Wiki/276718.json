 "text": "Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is the protagonist of the anime and manga franchise Naruto made by Masashi Kishimoto. At the start, he is a ninja student who lives in the village of Kohoha. The others in the town do not like him because he has the soul of the Fox Demon Kurama sealed inside him, but Naruto wants to become the Hokage (town's leader). During his studies, Naruto learns many jutsu (techniques), including a Shadow Clone jutsu which he excels at also a jutsu taught by his sensei Master Jiraiya the Rasengan. His energetic personality lets him make friends with many people, including his friend and rival Sasuke. In every official Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity poll of the series, Naruto ranks in the top five characters. From the beginning of 2012, he has been in first place twice. Naruto was placed sixth in IGN's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time. ==References== category:Naruto characters",
