 "text": "In sport, a cap is a player's appearance in an international game. The term comes from the practice in the United Kingdom of giving a cap to every player in an international match of rugby football and association football. In the early days of football, the concept of each team wearing a set of matching shirts was not commonly used. Instead, each side would wear a different type of hat to appear different than their opponent. == Other websites == * Men's Records and Facts—FIFA * Players with 100+ Caps (men) RSSSF * Picture of International Football Cap—National Museum of Scotland * Gallery of International Caps and Honours Caps Category:Sports words",
