 "text": "The Wright SRM (SRM means Son of Route Master) is a double-decker body of a bus. It has a low-floor. It was made in 2016 by Wrightbus. The Wright SRM body was built on the hybrid Volvo B5LH chassis and the hybrid Volvo B5LHC chassis. The bus is similar to the New Routemaster but it doesn't have a rear staircase or a rear door. It was made for different bus operators, instead of just for London bus operators. ==Operators== In 2016, London Sovereign ordered 6 Volvo B5LH SRMs for use on route 13. In 2018, 2 Volvo B5LHC SRMs were sent to London Central, these had pantograph chargers on the roof that can charge the B5LHC's batteries when attached to Volvo 'OppCharge' charging gantries. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Double-decker buses Category:Low-floor buses SRM",
