With the help of an Aboriginal tracker named Billy, Clare looks to take revenge for the terrible acts carried out against her and her family by British Army officers. The movie was given positive reviews for its performances, atmosphere, cinematography, screenplay, scope and acknowledgement of racial violence in Australia. However, there was some controversy due to its scenes that include violence and rape. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:2018 thriller movies Category:2018 drama movies Category:2010s psychological movies Category:Australian drama movies Category:Australian thriller movies Category:2010s drama thriller movies Category:2010s English-language movies Category:Rape in movies Category:Movies set in the 19th century Category:Movies set in the 1820s",
