 "text": "The Kilmainham Gaol was a prison in Ireland. The Kilmainham Gaol opened in 1796. It was a county jail for the city of Dublin. It stopped being a jail in 1924. Today, Irish people think of Kilmainham Gaol as related to nationalism because many rebels and nationalists were prisoners in that jail. Ordinary criminals were also prisoners in the jail. Some of the people held in Kilmainham Gaol were later transported to Australia, meaning they were forced to move to Australia. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Ireland Category:Prisons in Europe",
