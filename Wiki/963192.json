 "text": "Dystopia is the fifteenth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. It was released by frontman Dave Mustaine's label, Tradecraft, on January 22, 2016. It is the first Megadeth album with Kiko Loureiro. Before Megadeth recorded Dystopia, drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick left the band. To replace them, the band had Chris Adler from Lamb of God play the drums and Kiko Loureiro from Angra play the guitar. This is the only Megadeth album with Adler, because he was replaced with Soilwork drummer Dirk Verbeuren after it was released. After the mixed (good and bad) reviews to the band's previous album, Super Collider, many critics liked Dystopia. The album came out at number three on the Billboard 200 chart. The song \"Dystopia\" from the album also won a Grammy Award. This was Megadeth's first time winning a Grammy after eleven nominations. == Track listing == == References == Category:2016 albums Category:Megadeth albums",
