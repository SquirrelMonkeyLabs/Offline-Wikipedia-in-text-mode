 "text": "Sodium methoxide is a chemical compound, with the chemical formula . It is an alkoxide salt of sodium. It is a strong base, too strong to exist in solution in water without reacting. Sodium methoxide is used to make biodiesel. It is a catalyst for a chemical reaction called transesterfication, which changes bio- based triglycerides and an alcohol (usually methanol) into fatty acid esters and glycerol. The fatty acid esters can then be purified into biodiesel. == References == Category:Alkoxides Category:Sodium compounds",
