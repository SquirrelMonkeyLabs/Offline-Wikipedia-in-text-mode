 "text": "The Croydon transmitting station is a broadcasting and telecommunications transmitter. It is in Upper Norwood, Croydon, London, England.\"TheBigTower Croydon Transmitter\" It is owned by Arqiva. It was built in 1955. It originally used a small lattice tower. The tower currently used was made in 1962. The mast is 152 metres (499 ft) high. The transmitter is also a maintenance base for transmitter maintenence teams. It also used to have one of four Regional Operations Centres. == History == It was made by the Independent Television Authority to broadcast ITV on VHF Band III. After UHF television began, the Crystal Palace transmitting station was used. After VHF television ended in January 1985, the Croydon transmitter was not used until 1997. In 1997, a new directional UHF antenna was given to the transmitter so it could transmit Channel 5 in London. Directional antennas were chosen so it wouldn't interfere with transmitters on continental Europe. It transmitted Channel 5's analogue signal until April 2012, when digital switchover meant that analogue signals were turned of in London. The digital Channel 5 signal was transmitted from Crystal Palace. Croydon also had backup transmitters for BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4. The backup transmitters were only used during engineering works or an issue at Crystal Palace. After the digital switchover, no television has been transmitted from Croydon. == Channels by frequency == === Analogue (FM) Radio === Frequency kW Service 94.9 MHz - BBC Radio London† 95.8 MHz 4 Capital Londonhttps://www.radiodns.uk/transmitters/tq332696 97.3 MHz 4 LBC 97.8 MHz 4 Croydon FM 100.0 MHz 4 Kiss 102.2 MHz 4 Smooth London 105.4 MHz 4 Magic 106.2 MHz 4 Heart London † Backup for the Crystal Palace transmitter. === Digital (DAB) Radio === Frequency Block kW Multiplex 218.640 MHz 11B 2.5 DRG London 223.936 MHz 12A 5 Switch London 227.260 MHz 12C 5 London 1 === Analogue television === ==== 22 September 1955 - 3 January 1985 ==== The first ITV companies which served London were Associated-Rediffusion on weekdays and Associated Television (ATV) on weekends.
