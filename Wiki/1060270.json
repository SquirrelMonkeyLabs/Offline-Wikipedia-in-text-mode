 "text": "The WAGR Db class were a total of 13 diesel-electric locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1982 to 2000. The Db class were built by Clyde Engineering of Rosewater, Adelaide, South Australia from 1982 to 1983 for Westrail. The Db was a much-improved version of the D and Da classes with a radically different cab design, completely new to Australian practice for diesel-electrics. Originally the Db class worked on the South Western mainline hauling bauxite trains and were named after Southern local government areas (LGAs). They also hauled woodchip trains from Bunbury to Lambert along with heavy wheat traffic to Albany if needed. Upon Westrail's sale to the Australian Railroad Group (ARG) in 2000 all were included. 7 current Db units are stored, having been withdrawn, 3 are in service with the CBH Group and 3 operate under Aurizon, all still working on Great Southern lines. == Gallery == File:DB1590 Albany, 1986.JPG|No. 1590 Shire of Collie at Albany in 1986.
