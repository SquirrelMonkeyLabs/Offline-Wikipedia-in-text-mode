 "text": "A wallflower is a shy or an introverted person, who attends social occasions by limiting his or her interactions with others. A wallflower can be talkative with friends while being cold to strangers. ==Origin== Wallflower is derived from a plant with the same name, which grows against a wall or within cracks between stone walls. This has contributed to its use as a metaphor for those who tend to watch others in social occasions. ==Theories== There are multiple theories explaining why someone is a wallflower, including the structural function theory, social conflict theory and symbolic interaction theory. Of the three theories, the symbolic interaction theory is said to be the most relevant. Wallflowers are said to be interested in no more than symbolic interactions. ===Body language=== In terms of body language, wallflowers tend to avoid eye contact, sometimes mistaken as rudeness by unsympathetic persons, especially ableists, when the behavior of some wallflowers is caused by mental conditions, such as social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder. In Nazi- occupied territories, those with traits of wallflowers were seen as Untermensch (\"subhuman\") and subject to genocide, which happened along with the Holocaust, * * * * * * * * * * * * * where at least 6,000,000 Jews (67% of pre-war European Jews) were killed. ===Social anxiety=== Some wallflowers have social anxiety, whose avoidance of interactions is associated with the fear of negative judgments. This leaves them with a higher chance of lacking social or romantic relationship. Loneliness and depression are particularly common among wallflowers. ==Related pages== * Loner * Hermit * Recluse * Christian monasticism ==References== Category:Culture Category:Society Category:Lifestyles Category:Psychology Category:Relationships",
