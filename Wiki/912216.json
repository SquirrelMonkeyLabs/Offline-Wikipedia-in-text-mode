 "text": "The brown-eyed tree frog (Nyctimantis rugiceps) is a frog that lives in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Scientists think it might live in Brazil too. Scientists have seen it between 200 and 1200 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 55.3 to 67.6 mm long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog is 59.7 to 63.0 mm long. The frog's skin is brown in color. It is dark brown on the sides and toes and light brown on the back. It has one to three large orange spots by its middle. It has a wide head, big black eyes, and large disks on its toes for climbing. It lives in primary forest and secondary forest in the Amazon lowlands. The male frog finds a hole in a tree trunk with a pool of water in it 10 to 40 cm deep. The holes are sometimes as close to the ground as 2 meters, but there are more of them more than 10 meters above the ground. If something frightens the male frog, it will hide in the water. The female frog comes to the tree trunk and lays her eggs in the water. The male frog sings all year, and he may stay near the same place for a long time. The female frog lays her eggs in the hole and the male frog fertilizes them. The female comes back to the hole to lay unfertilized eggs, which the tadpoles eat. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
