 "text": "Thescelosaurus was a medium-sized 2.5 and 4.0 meters (8.2 to 13.1 ft) in length on average. plant-eating dinosaur. It lived in forests during the late Cretaceous period in North America, about 68 to 65 million years ago. One complete specimen and eight incomplete Thescelosaurus skeletons, including skin impressions, are known. They have been found in Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota in the USA, and in Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada. True Thescelosaurus remains are known definitely only from late Maastrichtian-age rocks, from Canada, Wyoming, Montana (Hell Creek), and Colorado (Laramie Formation), USA. With the exception of birds, it was one of the last genera of dinosaurs. Its remains were found three meters from the boundary clay containing the iridium layer that marks the end of the Cretaceous. == References == category:Hypsilophodontidae",
