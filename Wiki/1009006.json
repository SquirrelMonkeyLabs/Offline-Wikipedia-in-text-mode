 "text": "A manifesto is a statement of what someone believes in or intends to do. Most manifestos belong to a group or an organisation and there is a process of agreeing what should be in them. Political parties often make manifestos saying what they want to do if they win power in an election. Writers and artists also make them. Usually a manifesto will talk about what people want to change. The Communist Manifesto is probably the most famous one. ==References== Category:Politics",
