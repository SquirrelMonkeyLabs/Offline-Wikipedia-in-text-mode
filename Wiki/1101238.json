 "text": "This article details the qualifying phase for rowing at the 2024 Summer Olympics. About two-thirds of the total quota will be awarded to the National Olympic Committees, not to specific athletes, at the 2023 World Rowing Championships, scheduled for 3 to 10 September in Belgrade, Serbia. The remainder of the total quota will be attributed to the eligible rowers at each of the four continental qualification regattas in Asia and Oceania, the Americas, Africa, and Europe, and at the final Olympic qualification regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland. All qualifying NOCs are limited to one berth per event, and only NOCs with fewer than two berths from the World Championships may compete in the continental qualifying regattas. Host nation France will be automatically granted a berth each in the men's and women's single sculls if it fails to qualify for any rowing event at the various regattas. Four quota places (two per gender) are entitled to the NOCs competing in the single sculls as bestowed upon the Universality principle. ==Timeline== Event Date Venue 2023 World Rowing Championships 3–10 September 2023 Belgrade African Continental Qualification Regatta 23–25 October 2023 Tunis Americas Continental Qualification Regatta 14–17 March 2024 Rio de Janeiro Asian & Oceania Continental Qualification Regatta 19–21 April 2024 Chungju European Continental Qualification Regatta 25–28 April 2024 Szeged Final Qualification Regatta 19–21 May 2024 Lucerne ==Qualification summary== Nation Men Women Crews Athletes M1x M2– M2x LM2x Athletes M4– M4x M8+ W1x W2– W2x LW2x W4– W4x W8+ 2 2 1 1 2 4 9 37 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 11 2 4 5 14 3 5 2 2 2 4 1 1 2 3 3 8 6 21 9 40 2 3 1 1 6 12 5 12 1 1 4 6 2 3 1 1 10 33 8 18 3 6 2 2 2 3 1 4 11 44 1 1 2 3 4 8 4 12 1 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 8 26 1 1 Total: 44 NOCs 19 11 11 10 7 7 5 19 11 11 10 7 7 5 140 362 ==Men's events== ===Men's single sculls=== Event #
