 "text": "Netflix Animation is a animation studio owned by Netflix. It makes animated movies and television series. == History == When Netflix started making animated movies and television series in 2013, they got a lot of help from other animation companies (usually DreamWorks). Since 2018, Netflix can make them without relying on other companies. Some of the first projects they made are the movie Klaus and the series Kid Cosmic. Things got complicated with how the company was running animation, so Netflix fired the Creative Director Phil Rynda, as well as canceled several projects. Many others left for other studios after this, including Mike Moon (who was leading the department of animation for adults) who moved to start his own company with Illumination. Netflix was about to buy the Australian animation studio Animal Logic in July 2022, when Melissa Cobb stopped being vice president of movie animation (Karen Toliver took her place) and stayed on the studio as a producer. In September 2022, Netflix Animation fired 30 people to try and make things more efficient. The company produced \"Wales of the Big Blue!\" with the London Symphony Orchestra, (also known as the LSO), which began airing in 2025. ==Known Projects== *I Heart Arlo *The Cuphead Show! *Wales of the Big Blue! *Rivit Monsters *Klaus *Kid Cosmic *Inside Job *Maya and the Three == References == animation",
