 "text": "Stripped is the fourth studio album by American singer Christina Aguilera. She wanted to move away from the teen pop style of her first album and have more control over her music and lyrics. She also changed her image, creating a new identity called “Xtina.” The album includes pop and R&B; songs, with influences from soul, rock, hip hop, and Latin music. Many songs talk about self-respect, while others discuss love, sex, and women’s rights. Aguilera worked with many new people to make the album. Stripped got mixed reviews. Some people liked it, while others thought it was not focused. Some compared it to Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson’s music. The album was very successful. It reached number two on the US music charts and sold 330,000 copies in its first week. In the US, it sold over five million copies. It was also a top- five album in countries like Canada, the UK, and New Zealand. In the UK, it was Aguilera’s best-selling album, selling two million copies. Over time, more people started to appreciate Stripped, and it was won one Grammy Award. It has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album had five big songs. The first, “Dirrty,” was not well-received because of its music video, but it became popular worldwide. The second, “Beautiful,” was praised and became a hit. The other three songs, “Fighter,” “Can’t Hold Us Down,” and “The Voice Within,” also did well. Aguilera performed songs from Stripped at big music award shows and went on two tours in 2003—one with Justin Timberlake and one on her own. ==Track listing== == References == Category:2002 albums Category:Christina Aguilera albums Category:Pop soul albums Category:Hip hop albums Category:R&B; albums",
