 "text": "Ludmila Vencová with marriage name Fliedrová (12 November 1905 - 16 October 1987) was a Czechoslovak track and field athlete. She was active during the 1920s, the early era of women's athletics. She was a world record holder in the shot put and represented Czechoslovakia at international competitions. ==Biography== ===Career=== On 2 October 1921 she won the 3 kg two-handed shot put at the first main women's athletics competitions. Vencová became a member of SS Univerzita Brno in later 1924 and was later a member of SK Achilles Brno (1925), SK Moravská Slavia (1926) and SK Moravská Ostrava (from 1929). Vencová was the record holder in the 5kg shot put. She broke the record on 11 July 1925 in Ljubljana with a distance of 8.40 metres with one hand and 16.25 metres. She broke again the record on 6 July 1926 in Prague with a distance of 8.76 metres (one hand) and 16.32 metres (both hands). She represented Czechoslovakia internationally between 1924 and 1929, including at the 1924 Women's Olympiad in Paris, France and the 1926 Women's World Games in Gothenburg, Sweden. ===Personal life=== Vencova was born on 12 November 1905 as a daughter of Antonín Venc (born 1869) and Antonie Vencová Dobrovolná (1878-1943). As she was a member of the SS Univerzita Brno in 1924, it's likely Vencová studied there. After her athletics career she became a teacher working at the Chlebovice elementary school from 1931 to 1938 and after World War II at the elementary school in Modřice from 1945. In the 1950s she was imprisoned for being a member of the Salvation Army and was around 12–14 years in Pankrác Prison in Prague. She died on 16 October 1987 at the age of 81 years. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:Czechoslovak sportspeople Category:Shot putters Category:Discus throwers Category:1987 deaths Category:World record holders Category:Prisoners",
