Watson received his PhD for Animal science and Grazing systems in 2000 and was recruited by the University of Georgia to lead a cattle grazing research program in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences where he helped developed a statewide grazing research program for cattle producers, looking at new forage and grazing technologies. Watson served as the State Extension Forage Specialist and Assistant Research Professor at Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University between January 2004 to August 2006. ==Notable publications== *Reinfection of Tall Fescue Cultivars with Non-Ergot Alkaloidâ€“Producing Endophytes *Liveweight and growth rate of cow-calf pairs grazing tall fescue pastures infected with either non-toxic (MaxQ) or toxic endophyte strains. Journal of Animal Science 79, Suppl. 1: 220. *Use of temperature data loggers to measure body temperature in cows grazing toxic or non-toxic tall fescue. Journal of Animal Science 79, Suppl. 1: 458. *Non-toxic endophyte (MaxQ) use for alleviating tall fescue toxicosis in stocker cattle.
