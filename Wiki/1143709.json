 "text": "Sublingual administration (abbreviated as SL), from the Latin word for \"under the tongue\", refers to a pharmacological method of drug delivery where substances are absorbed into the bloodstream through tissues located under the tongue. This route is often preferred for its rapid absorption and avoiding the first-pass metabolism in the liver, making it a faster and more effective method for certain drugs. == Principle == When a substance is placed beneath the tongue, it comes into contact with the mucous membranes and diffuses into the blood via the numerous capillaries present in the area. This method bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and the liver's first-pass metabolism, allowing for more direct entry into systemic circulation. This is especially useful for drugs that might be degraded by stomach acids or enzymes if taken orally.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206068https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950356 == Forms == * Sublingual tablets * Sublingual strips * Multi-purpose tabletshttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2234198 * Sublingual dropshttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950356 * Sublingual sprays * Lozenges * Effervescent buccal or sublingual tablets == Advantages == * Faster onset of action compared to oral administration * Avoids degradation by stomach acids and digestive enzymes * Bypasses first-pass metabolism in the liver == References == Category:Pharmacology Category:Drug delivery devices Category:Routes of administration",
