He was the 23rd Governor of California from 1911 to 1917 and a United States Senator from 1917 to 1945. He was also Theodore Roosevelt's running mate in the 1912 presidential election on the Progressive (also known as the \"Bull Moose\") ticket. Johnson unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1920 and 1924 and supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Johnson supported many of the New Deal programs but came to oppose Roosevelt as his presidency grew longer. Johnson remained in the Senate until his death in 1945 from cerebral thrombosis. ==References== ==Other websites== * Guide to the Hiram Johnson Papers at the Bancroft Library * Category:1866 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Deaths from cerebral thrombosis Category:Governors of California Category:United States senators from California Category:American progressives Category:Politicians from Sacramento, California Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
