 "text": "Highway 99 (British Columbia Highway 99) is a provincial highway in British Columbia that travels from the U.S. border to near Cache Creek, serving Greater Vancouver and the Squamish–Lillooet corridor. It is a major north–south road within Vancouver and connects the city to several suburbs as well as the U.S. border, where it continues south as Interstate 5. The central section of the route, also known as the Sea to Sky Highway, serves the communities of Squamish, Whistler, and Pemberton. Highway 99 continues through Lillooet and ends at a junction with Highway 97 near Cache Creek. The highway's number, named in 1940s, was derived from former U.S. Route 99, the predecessor to Interstate 5 and a major route for the U.S. West Coast. Highway 99 originally was the King George Highway in Surrey, portions of Kingsway from New Westminster to Vancouver, and local streets. It was extended across the Lions Gate Bridge and to Horseshoe Bay in the 1950s along a new highway that would later be incorporated into Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway), which has a concurrency with Highway 99 in West Vancouver. ==Cities and towns along the highway== * Surrey, British Columbia * Delta, British Columbia * Richmond, British Columbia * Vancouver * West Vancouver * Whistler, British Columbia * Lillooet * Cache Creek, British Columbia Category:British Columbia provincial highways Category:Freeways in British Columbia Category:Highways in Greater Vancouver",
