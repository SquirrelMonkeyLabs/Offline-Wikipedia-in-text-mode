 "text": "Plasmolysis is the process in which cells lose water in a hypertonic solution. It is the shrinkage of the cytoplasm and cell surface membrane from the cell wall. If a plant cell is placed in a solution of lower water potential, the molecules of water leave the vacuole by osmosis. The vacuole loses water and becomes smaller. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. ==Etymology== The term plasmolysis comes from the Latin word plasma meaning ‘matrix’ and the Greek word lysis, meaning ‘loosening’. Category:Cell biology",
