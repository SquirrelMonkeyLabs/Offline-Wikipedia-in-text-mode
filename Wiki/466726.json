O'Connor, the Engineer-in-Chief of Western Australia who designed Fremantle Harbour and the Goldfields Pipeline. It was set up for the 1980 election. There were large changes to the area covered by O'Connor for the 2010 election. The northern half was added to the new seat of Durack. The boundary for the division moved to the east, including most of the south part of the former Division of Kalgoorlie. It now includes the cities of Albany and Kalgoorlie, and the regional towns of Bridgetown, Denmark, Esperance, Kojonup, Laverton, Leonora, Manjimup, Mount Barker, Ravensthorpe, Southern Cross, Wagin and Warburton. ==Members== Member Party Term Wilson Tuckey Liberal 1980–2010 Tony Crook WA Nationals 2010–2013 Rick Wilson Liberal 2013–present ==Election results== ==References== ==Other websites== * Division of O'Connor - Australian Electoral Commission * Rick Wilson's website Category:Electoral divisions of Western Australia Category:1980 establishments in Australia",
