 "text": "The Sierra de Aroa collared frog (Mannophryne molinai) is a frog. It lives in the Cordillera de la Costa in Yaracuy, Venezuela. Scientists think it might live in Colombia too. ==Home== Scientists first saw this frog in one place: La Rondona on the southeast side of the Sierra de Aroa, which is in the Cordillera de la Costa. This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams in forests on mountains. Scientists saw the frog between 143 and 1217 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in one protected park: Reserva Ecológica Guáquira. The frog also lives near Yurubí National Park and might live inside it. ==Young== The male frogs call to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms. People also take water from streams for farms. Fires can also hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
