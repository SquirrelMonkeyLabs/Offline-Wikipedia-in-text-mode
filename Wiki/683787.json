Spencer does not believe that he is a white supremacist and calls himself a white nationalist. He has been called a neo-Nazi. Spencer created the term \"alt-right\", which he thinks is a movement about \"white identity\". Spencer was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He was raised in Dallas, Texas and in Whitefish, Montana. Spencer studied at the University of Virginia and at the University of Chicago. Like many white supremacists, he supported Donald Trump when he ran for president in 2016. However, by 2020 he felt it was a bad choice. He decided to support Joe Biden in the 2020 elections, but Biden's team said he didn't want his support. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American political activists Category:American political writers Category:American atheists Category:Writers from Boston Category:Writers from Montana Category:Writers from Virginia Category:Writers from Dallas Category:People from Whitefish, Montana",
