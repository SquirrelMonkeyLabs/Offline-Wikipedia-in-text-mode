Each person can have their own ORCID.Editorial (2009). \"Credit where credit is due\". Nature. 462: 825. News (30 May 2012) \"Scientists: your number is up: ORCID scheme will give researchers unique identifiers to improve tracking of publications.\", Declan Butler, \"Nature\". 485: 564 ORCIDs make it easy to know which articles someone has written, even if they change their name. They also helps tell who has written which articles, if there is more than one writer with the same name. ORCID was started on 16 October 2012. ORCIDs usually have four groups of four numbers. An example of a person with an ORCID is John Wilbanks. His ORCID is https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385. That is also the web address of the page about him, on the ORCID website. His ORCID can also be written as \"ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385\". Sometimes an ORCID has an \"X\" instead of a number at the end. An example of this is Nick Jennings's ORCID. His is https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X. The final number (or \"X\") is a check digit. == References == == Other websites == * ORCID website Category:Academia Category:Identifiers",
