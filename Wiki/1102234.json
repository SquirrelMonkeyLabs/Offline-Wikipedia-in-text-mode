 "text": "The white-cheeked jelly-nest frog or white-cheeked small tree frog (Feihyla fuhua) is a frog. It lives in China in Yunnan Province, Guangxi Province, and Guizhou Province. Scientists think it probably lives in Vietnam too. People see this frog in forests near streams between 1000 and 1900 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs on leaves in piles of jelly. The tadpoles swim in still water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. Human beings can make some problems for this frog by cutting down tree to get wood to use. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Hualinshan Nature Reserves. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
