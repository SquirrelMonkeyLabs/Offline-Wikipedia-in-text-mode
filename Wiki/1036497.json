 "text": "The coppersmith frog, Himalayan foam nesting frog, Himalaya bubble-nest frog, or Annandale's bush frog (Raorchestes annandalii) is a frog. It lives in Nepal, Bhutan, and India. People have seen it as high as 2700 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees in evergreen forests and shrublands on mountains and hills. It lives in bushes and tall grass. It can live near humans. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe bad chemicals from tea farms may hurt it in some places. Two of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Namdapha Wildlife Sanctuary and Dibang Wildlife Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
