 "text": "West Virginia's 3rd congressional district is a U.S. congressional district that is no longer in use. It used to be in southern West Virginia. It used to represent Huntington, Bluefield, Princeton, and Beckley. The district was last represented by Republican Carol Miller. However, because West Virginia lost a congressional seat in the 2020 census, it was eliminated in 2023. On October 22, 2021, Governor Jim Justice signed the new congressional map into law. Under the plan, the old 3rd essentially became the new 1st. ==References== Category:Congressional districts of West Virginia",
