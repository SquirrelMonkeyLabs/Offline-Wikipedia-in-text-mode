 "text": "Wizardry is a series of computer role-playing games that were popular in the 1980s. First, made for the Apple II, they were later moved to other platforms. The latest game in the series, Wizardry 8, is only for Windows. Wizardry began as a simple dungeon crawl by Andrew C. Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. It was written when they were students at Cornell University and then published by Sir-Tech. David W. Bradley took over the series after the fourth game. ==Series== Ultimately the single game became a series: ===Main series=== #Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord (1981) #Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds - The Second Scenario (1982) #Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn - The Third Scenario (1983) #Wizardry: The Return of Werdna - The Fourth Scenario (1986) #Wizadry V: Heart of the Maelstrom (1988) #Bane of the Cosmic Forge (1990) #Crusaders of the Dark Savant (1992) (Remade as Wizardry Gold in 1996) #Wizardry 8 (2001) ===Spin-offs=== #Nemesis: The Wizardry Adventure (1998) #Wizadry Chronicle (2001) #Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land (2001) #Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls (2011) #Wizardry Online (2013) The first and last three games were trilogies (Three parts of one story). ==Legacy== Wizardry inspired many games which were almost exactly like it. Some notable series that are very much like Wizardry include The Bard's Tale and Might and Magic. == Other websites == * Official Wizardry 8 website * Prepare Yourself for the Ultimate in Fantasy Games * Moby Games entry on Wizardry * Page with a lot of mods and inofficial patches Category:Apple II games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video game series Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games",
