It is about outside Bishop's Stortford and outside Harlow. Stansted is a hub for a number of major European low-cost carriers. It is the fourth busiest airport in the United Kingdom and is the third largest airport serving the London area after Heathrow and Gatwick; and is one of London's five international airports along with Luton and London City Airports. Stansted is owned and operated by Manchester Airports Group, which also owns and operates three other UK airports, including Manchester and Bournemouth. The airport had to abandon plans for a second runway after the campaign Stop Stansted Expansion succeeded. == References == Stansted Category:Uttlesford",
