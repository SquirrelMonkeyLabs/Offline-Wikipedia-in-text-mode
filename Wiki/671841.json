 "text": "The Dhulbahante garaadship is a kingdom from 1530. The first Garaad was Garaad Shirshoore. Diiriye Guure was the first Dhulbahante king to become king through being elected by the people. Diiriye Guure was also the first Dhulbahante monarch to be called sultan. By proclaiming himself Dhulbahante Sultan, Diiriye Guure reunited the Dhulbahante schism created by Ali Harran, also spelled Ali Xaram of the Maxamud Garad subclan, and Garaad Ali III around 7 decades earlier. Diiriye Guure was the first Dhulbahante king whose position was subordinate to someone else, namely the Sayid. Aar Dheel and Diiriye Guure are the only two people who gained the Dhulbahante throne despite not being in the line of succession. == Garaads == # Garaad Reign Notes 1 Shirshoore 1530-1550 Established the Dhulbahante garaadship 2 Garaad Farah 1550-1590 3 Garaad Abdalla II 1590-1600 4 Garaad Yasin 1600-1620 5 Baharsame 1620-1650 Real name was Garad Mohamed I 6 Jabane 1650-1685 Real name was Garad Mohamud 7 Garaad Ali I 1685-1708 8 Garaad Mohamud II 1708-1734 9 Garaad Mohamed II 1734-1760 10 Garaad Mohamud III 1760-1780 11 Garaad Ali II 1780-1802 12 Garaad Mohamed III 1802-1825 13 Garaad Ali III 1825-1840 14 Korebas 1840-1863 Also called the warrior garaad.
