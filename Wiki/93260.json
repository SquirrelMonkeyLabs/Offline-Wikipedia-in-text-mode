 "text": "Höxter () is a Kreis (district) in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. == History == In 1816 the new Prussian government created three districts in the area, Höxter, Brakel and Warburg. In 1832 Höxter and Brakel were joined as Höxter. The present district was created in 1975 when the former districts Warburg and Höxter were merged. At the same time the municipalities in the district were joined to form the ten cities that exist today. == Coat of arms == The lily in the bottom comes from the old coat of arms of the Warburg district, and is also found in the coat of arms of the city Warburg. The blue wave line stands for the river Weser, and the cross in the top derives from the coat of arms of the state of Paderborn, which was controlled by the bishop. ==Towns and municipalities== # Bad Driburg # Beverungen # Borgentreich # Brakel # Höxter 6.
