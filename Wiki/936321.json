The skyscraper would have 14 concave dish shaped modules called space plateaus. These modules were later copied and adapted for use in the proposed SpaceCity 6000. Each space plateau would have green space. These spaces would be used as a courtyard for the apartments, office suites, stores and other indoor facilities on the plataeu.
