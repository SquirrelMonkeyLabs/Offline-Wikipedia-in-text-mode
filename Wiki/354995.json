 "text": "The parotoid gland is a skin gland on the back, neck and shoulder of toads and some frogs and salamanders. It secretes a substance that predators can smell. This smell will tell them that they are toxic animals. The substance, bufotoxin, acts as a neurotoxin. Parotoid glands looks like warts on an amphibian skin. However, warts are grown by viral infections. Parotoid glands are normal and healthy parts of the animals that have them. Many people believe that touching a toad may cause warts. However, this is not true. == References == Category:Amphibians Category:Animal anatomy Category:Glands",
