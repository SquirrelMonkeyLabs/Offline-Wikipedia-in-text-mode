 "text": "Marcial Maciel Degollado (March 10, 1920 – January 30, 2008) was a Mexican Catholic priest. He founded the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi movement. He was general director of the legion from 1941 to 2005. Throughout most of his career, he was respected within the church as \"the greatest fundraiser of the modern Roman Catholic church\". Late in his life, Maciel was revealed to have been for a long time a drug addict who sexually abused many boys and young men. After his death, it became known that he had sexual relationships with at least two women, one of whom was a minor at the time. He fathered as many as six children, two of whom he is alleged to have abused. In 2006 Pope Benedict XVI removed Maciel from active ministry, before his election as Pope in April 2005. Maciel was ordered \"to conduct a reserved life of prayer and penance, renouncing every public ministry\", and died in 2008. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Mexican Roman Catholic priests Category:People from Michoacán",
