It moved down the river from the first site in 1918. In 1942, new location of the village was said to be still too far up the river. Also, it was being flooded too often. This caused them to move village to its current location. A school and a post office were built in 1961. ==References== Category:settlements in Alaska Category:1918 establishments in the United States Category:1942 establishments in the United States Category:1940s establishments in Alaska Category:20th-century establishments in Alaska",
