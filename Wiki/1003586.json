 "text": "Håkøya is an island in Tromsø Municipality, Norway. It's a island located in between two other islands called Kvaløya and Tromsøya. It's close to a town called Eidkjosen and a city called Tromsø. Most of the trees are on the higher parts of the island. People mostly live near the water, and there are houses, small holiday homes, and farms. There is a bridge that connects Håkøya to Kvaløya called Håkøybrua. The bridge used to be made of wood, but now it's made of steel and concrete. During World War II, a ship called the Tirpitz was on Håkøya. The ship belonged to Germany, and it was there for about a month. But then British planes came and bombed the ship, and it sank. Many people died, and there is now a memorial on Håkøya to remember them. == References == Category:Islands of Norway Category:Geography of Norway Category:Troms",
