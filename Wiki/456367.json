 "text": "Tinglish is an English dialect used by Thai people. English is more complicated than the Thai language and English grammar is easily understood. Tinglish is a simple form of English that is usually hard to understand by English speakers. However, many words in Tinglish have a uniquely Thai pronunciation. Time can be a confusing subject in Tinglish. Thais use a 24-hour clock instead of a 12-hour clock. == References == Category:Dialects of English",
