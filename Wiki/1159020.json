 "text": "The 2010 Mardakert skirmish was a border clash between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces on the night of June 18â€“19, 2010, near the village of Chayli in the Mardakert region of Nagorno-Karabakh. During the skirmish, Azerbaijani soldier Mubariz Ibrahimov crossed the front line into Armenian- controlled territory. He engaged Armenian forces, killing several soldiers before being killed in action. Azerbaijani sources claim Ibrahimov killed over 45 Armenian soldiers, though this figure is unverified and disputed by Armenian officials, who deny such high casualties. The skirmish resulted in the deaths of four Azerbaijani soldiers, while Armenia reported no casualties, though this claim was contested by Azerbaijan. Ibrahimov was posthumously awarded the title of National Hero of Azerbaijan. Mardakert skirmish Category:Nagorno-Karabakh Category:2010s conflicts",
