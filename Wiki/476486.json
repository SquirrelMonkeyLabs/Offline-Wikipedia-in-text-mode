 "text": "Outlaws is an American country rock band formed in 1972. They are a Southern rock/country rock band. Some of their best known hits were \"There Goes Another Love Song\" (1975), \"Green Grass and High Tides\" (1975) and \"Ghost Riders In The Sky\". Like other southern rock bands, the Outlaws used two lead guitars. However, the Outlaws’ used three and four part vocal harmonies which made them different from other southern rock bands who usually had a single lead singer.
