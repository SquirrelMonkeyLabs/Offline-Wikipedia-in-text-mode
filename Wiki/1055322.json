 "text": "Stewart Island (, 'glowing skies', officially Stewart Island / Rakiura) is an island of New Zealand which is part of Southland. It is the country's third largest island and is located south of the South Island, across the Foveaux Strait. The island's only town is Oban, which is on Halfmoon Bay. The economy of Stewart Island is mostly based on fishing and summer tourism, because in the winter it gets very cold on the island. The island can be accessed by boat or by plane. Ryan's Creek Aerodrome is the only airport on the island and offers direct flights to and from Invercargill Airport with Stewart Island Flights and to and from Queenstown Airport with Glenorchy Air. Ferries connect the island to the town of Bluff on the South Island. ==References== Category:Islands of New Zealand",
