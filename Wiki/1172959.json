 "text": "The Urticant collared frog (Mannophryne urticans) is a frog. It lives in the Cordillera de Mérida in Mérida, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams on mountains. It also lives near streams in forests that are growing back, coffee farms, and cocoa farms. Sometimes people see it next to roads if there is water there. Scientists saw the frog between 285 and 1168 meters above sea level. Scientists have not seen this frog in any protected parks, but they saw it near Sierra de la Culata National Park. ==Young== The male frogs call to the female frogs. Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Mannophryne do: The female frogs lay eggs on land. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places to raise animals. Bad chemicals in the water and diseases could also hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
