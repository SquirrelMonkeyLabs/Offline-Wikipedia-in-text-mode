 "text": "is a meat specialty. Other names include Leberkäs, Leberka(a)sand Fleischkäse. It originally was from the South of Germany. It can also be found in Austria and Switzerland. It is similar to meatloaf. It is made of corned beef, sometimes pork, bacon and onions. The ingredients are ground until they are very fine. They are then packed together into loaves. These are baked in an oven, until they get a brown crust. ==Etymology== The word \"Leberkäse\" literally translates to \"liver-cheese\". In Bavaria there is neither cheese nor liver in the dish, though. Some linguists say, that the word may be related to the German word Laib (loaf). Perhaps it also contains the Slavic root quas (yeast). ==What can be in Leberkäse== According to German food laws, only products called \"Bavarian Leberkäse\" are allowed not to have liver in them; otherwise, there must be a minimum liver content of 4%. Some local variants must contain even more liver; for example, the liver content of \"Stuttgarter Leberkäse\" must be at least 5%. ==Eating Leberkäse== There are several ways of eating Leberkäse: *Cut into approximately finger-thick slices which are then placed in a semmel while still hot and seasoned with mustard. The result, generally called Leberkässemmel, is a staple of Bavarian and Austrian fast food restaurants. *Alternatively, the slices can also be pan-fried (\"abgebräunt\", browned), in which case they are commonly accompanied by a fried egg and German potato salad. This is a very common Biergarten dish sometimes called Strammer Max. *Cold Leberkäse can also be cut into very thin slices and be used on a variety of sandwiches. ==References== == Other websites == *Bavarian Leberkäse Category:Meat dishes",
