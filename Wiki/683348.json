It is a daughter language of Mandarin Chinese based on Gansu and Shaanxi dialects, and speakers of both dialects can largely understand each other. This is called mutual intelligibilty. Like Chinese, it is both tonal and analytic. However, differences between Dungan and Chinese are that Dungan is written in Cyrillic instead of Chinese characters and there are differences in vocabulary. Dungan has more Arabic and Persian loanwords and several terms are no longer used in Standard Chinese. == References == Category:Languages of China Category:Languages of Russia Category:Languages of Tajikistan Category:Languages of Kyrgyzstan Category:Languages of Kazakhstan Category:Languages of Turkmenistan Category:Languages of Uzbekistan Category:Sino-Tibetan languages",
