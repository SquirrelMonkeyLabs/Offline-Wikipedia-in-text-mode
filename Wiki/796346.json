 "text": "Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt, (Born September 6, 1817, died September 19, 1893) was a politician and a father of the Canadian Confederation. He began working in Canada with the British American Land Company in Lower Canada's Eastern Townships. He was angry about the political deadlock in the united legislature of Canada East (Qu√©bec) and Canada West (Ontario). He first supported annexation to the United States, but later worked for a federal union of the British North American colonies. After Confederation, he moved from electoral politics into diplomacy. He continued to promote development in the Eastern Townships and later in southern Alberta. ==References== Category:1817 births Category:1893 deaths Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:Canadian politicians Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Quebec Category:Order of St Michael and St George Category:People from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:Privy Councillors (Canada)",
