Music of the Heart was released on October 29, 1999. The movie is based on the true story of Roberta Guaspari, who was the co-founder the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music. It is director Wes Craven's movie outside of the horror/thriller genre to date. It was also his first movie to receive an Academy Award nomination. The movie gained mixed reviews from critics and holds a 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars and said, \"Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood.\" The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards; Meryl Streep was nominated for Best Actress and scored songwriter Diane Warren was nominated for Best Original Song for the song \"Music of My Heart\". Streep was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress in a Motion Picture â€“ Drama. == Cast == * Meryl Streep as Roberta Guaspari * Gloria Estefan as Isabel Vasquez * Angela Bassett as Principal Janet Williams * Aidan Quinn as Brian Turner * Cloris Leachman as Assunta Guaspari * Jane Leeves as Dorothea von Haeften ==References== == Other websites == *Official website * Category:1999 drama movies Category:American drama movies Category:1990s English-language movies Category:Miramax movies Category:Movies based on real life events Category:Movies directed by Wes Craven Category:Movies set in New York City Category:Movies about classical music and musicians Category:Movies about violins and violinists",
