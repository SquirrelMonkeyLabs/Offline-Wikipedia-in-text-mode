In public speaking there are five important questions, which are often expressed as \"who is saying what to whom, using which medium, with what effects?\" The Ancient Greeks called public speaking rhetoric; the Romans called it oratory. Until the late 20th century it was also called forensic speaking, or forensics. Propaganda is an another name for speech for or against some point of view. In George Orwell's words propaganda is a reflection of prejudices and beliefs that colors people's [or societies] aesthetic judgements. Often they are simply fallacies or conjectures. == Methods and techniques == Professional public speakers may use storytelling techniques or humor as a communication tool. A public speaker who is strong at using comedy might have more success adding a joke into a speech than one who is weak in that area. A speaker's guideline is given in TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking.Anderson, Chris (3 May 2016). \"TED Talks: The official TED guide to public speaking\". Their information includes: * Try to make eye contact right from the start. * Include humor to disarm the tension within the audience towards the subject. But no offensive jokes or corny puns. * Drinking water avoids mouth getting dry from adrenalin and avoiding an empty stomach reduces anxiety. * Keep a backup plan (notes or scripts) to use if the presentation technology goes wrong. * It is better to avoid attempts to get applause. It is not about the speaker, but the idea the speaker is passionate about. Other guidelines exist. ==Models== Models in public speaking.
