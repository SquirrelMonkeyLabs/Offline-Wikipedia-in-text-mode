 "text": "The Staple Singers were an American gospel, soul and R&B; singing group. ==Members== Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples (1914–2000), the founder of the family group, formed the group with his children Cleotha (1934–2013), Pervis (1935-2021), and Mavis (b. 1939). Yvonne (1936–2018) replaced her brother when he was drafted into the U.S. Army, and again in 1970. ==Songs== They are best known for their 1970s hits \"Respect Yourself\", \"I'll Take You There\", \"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\", and \"Let's Do It Again\", which with one exception (\"I'll Take You There\") peaked on the Hot 100 within a week from Christmas Day. While the family name is Staples, the group used \"Staple\" commercially. ==Awards== In 1999, The Staple Singers was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2005, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The Staple Singers were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2018. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Staple Singers at VH1 Category:African-American musical groups Category:African-American singers Category:Gospel Music Hall of Fame inductees Category:1948 establishments in the United States Category:1940s establishments in Illinois Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1994 Category:1994 disestablishments in the United States Category:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Category:American gospel musicians",
