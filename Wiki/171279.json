It can also be written as 10−18 seconds. Because it can be hard to think about how short this period of time is, on this page is a list of descriptions of periods of time longer than 1 attosecond, but shorter than one femtosecond (which is 10−15 seconds). This should help when thinking about periods of time that have different orders of magnitude. * 1 attosecond: It takes 1 attosecond for light to travel the length of three hydrogen atoms. * 1 attosecond: It takes 1 attosecond for an atomic nucleus to react when another particle hits it. * 150 attoseconds: It takes 150 attoseconds for an electron to circle the nucleus of an atom. * 320 attoseconds: It takes about 300 attoseconds for an electron to jump from one atom to another. == Related pages == * Click this link for times shorter than one attosecond. * Zetosecond (1/1000 of a attosecond) == Notes == Category:Units of time Category:Orders of magnitude",
