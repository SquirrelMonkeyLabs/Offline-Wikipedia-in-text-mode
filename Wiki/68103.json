 "text": "Prahlada (), In Hinduism, was a prince who was very devoted to Vishnu. His father, Hiranyakashipu, was a powerful demon who wanted his son to worship him instead. But Prahlada refused, and he continued to worship Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu tried to kill Prahlada many times, but Vishnu always protected him. Finally, Vishnu appeared in his Narasimha avatar, a half-man, half-lion form, and killed Hiranyakashipu. == References == Category:Hinduism",
