 "text": "The South Central Bell Telephone Company is an Internet/telephone network provider in the Southern United States. It operates in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and part of Louisiana.. It was created in July 1968 when the Southern Bell telephone company was divided. Beginning in 1992, the name South Central Bell was no longer used for corporate marketing although the SCB provider still exists. Southern Bell and South Central Bell today do business as the \"new\" AT&T; (or American Telephone and Telegraph). This is following a merger between SBC Communications and the original AT&T; in 2006. In the late 2000s or 2010s, the South Central Bell and Southern Bell names were brought back by the \"new\" AT&T.; ==References== Category:American telephone companies Category:1992 disestablishments in the United States Category:21st-century establishments",
