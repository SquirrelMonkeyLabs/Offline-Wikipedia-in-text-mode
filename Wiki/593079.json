 "text": "Antonius Tom Holkenborg (born 8 December 1967 in Lichtenvoorde), known by his stage name Junkie XL and occasionally JXL, is a Dutch multi-instrumentalist, composer, DJ, producer, and engineer. Originally known for his trance productions, he has moved to producing electronica and big beat music and film scores in recent years. Junkie XL is probably best known for his remix of Elvis Presley's \"A Little Less Conversation\". ==Works== In movie scores, he is perhaps known for his work on films like 300: Rise of an Empire, Mad Max: Fury Road, the Deadpool movies, and the DC Extended Universe beginning with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice with Hans Zimmer, also contributing to the theme song for Wonder Woman. He was originally hired to write the music for Justice League but left the project with director Zack Snyder and was replaced with Danny Elfman. However, when Snyder was brought back to complete his version of the movie, later titled Zack Snyder's Justice League, Junkie XL was brought back as well and finished the music for it. Junkie XL was born in Lichtenvoorde, Gelderland, Netherlands. ==Other websites== *Junkie XL official website *Junkie XL official facebook page * *Junkie XL YouTube Video Page at YouTube *Interview with Garrett Shatzer for Onbeat, 2006 *Junkie XL scoring 300: Rise of an Empire Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Dutch composers Category:21st-century Dutch composers Category:Dutch DJs Category:Drummers Category:Dutch engineers Category:Dutch guitarists Category:Keyboardists Category:People from Gelderland Category:Dutch record producers Category:Audio engineers",
