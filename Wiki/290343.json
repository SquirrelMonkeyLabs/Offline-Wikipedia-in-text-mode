 "text": "Maratone is a music production company, started by two music producers and songwriters, Max Martin and Tom Talomaa. It was started in January 2001 after the closing of the Cheiron Studios. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for Britney SpearsÂ´ third album \"Britney\". With Kelly Clarkson's hits Since U Been Gone and Behind These Hazel Eyes, which were produced at Maratone, Max Martin had reinvented himself (together with Lukasz Gottwald) by using a completely different sound than the \"Cheiron sound\" which he was so famous for. He has continued to use the new rock sound on hits for a-ha, Pink and many more. == Other websites == * Maratone's web site Category:Music companies Category:Companies of Sweden",
