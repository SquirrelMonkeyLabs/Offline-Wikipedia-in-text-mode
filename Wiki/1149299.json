The games are for two players where one player controls Fireboy, and the other controls Watergirl. Fireboy cannot touch water, and similarly, Watergirl cannot touch fire. Both of them have to avoid green slime because it's deadly for both. == Gameplay == In all games, the player must move Fireboy and Watergirl through levels containing puzzles, traps, and obstacles. Players must cooperate in order to solve the puzzles blocking their way out to reach the exit doors. Fireboy collects red diamonds, while Watergirl collects blue diamonds. == Development == Oslo Albet said that he developed Fireboy and Watergirl because he had \"always found puzzle games to be fascinating\". He finalized the game mechanics before creating the characters as he was more interested in the game play. == Release == The first game in the series, Fireboy and Watergirl in the Forest Temple, was released in 2009 on the software platform Adobe Flash and hosted on the online web portal Cool Math Games\"Playing with friends equals gaming success\". MCV. July 2, 2013. Archived from the original on January 20, 2024. Retrieved January 20, 2024. == Reception == GamerBolt praised the pacing of the game by stating that the \"too-easy\" introductory levels did not take too long to complete before the game became more challenging. == References == Category:Browser games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Educational video games Category:Indie video games Category:Puzzle-platformers",
