 "text": "A series of strikes between Israel and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have been happening along the Israel–Lebanon border and in Syria and the Israeli- occupied Golan Heights a day after 7 October 2023. It is the largest escalation of the Hezbollah–Israel conflict and is part of the Israel–Hamas war. On 8 October 2023, Hezbollah started firing guided rockets at Israeli positions while supporting Palestinians after the the Hamas attack on Israel that took place a day earlier. Israel began launching drone strikes at Hezbollah areas near Lebanon's boundary with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. An increase in tensions happened in September 2024, starting with the Lebanon pager explosions—which targeted Hezbollah. Israel said that its attacks would continue until Israeli citizens in near the northern border could return home safely. The deadliest and most widespread casualties in Lebanon resulted from Israeli airstrikes on 23 September that resulted in at least 558 deaths and more than 1,835 injuries including children, women and paramedics. During this campaign, IDF forces bombed and destroyed Hezbollah's central command headquarters in Beirut, killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. On 1 October, the Israeli military began an invasion into southern Lebanon, and announced that it had been carrying out small raids into Lebanon for months. A ceasefire agreement was made and took effect on 27 November 2024. ==Notes== ==References== Category:7 October attacks Category:October 2024 events Category:Hezbollah Category:November 2024 events Category:December 2024 events",
