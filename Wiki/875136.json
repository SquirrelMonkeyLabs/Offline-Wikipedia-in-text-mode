 "text": "The Nephilim, also known as Nephilites (; ) are mysterious beings mentioned in the Hebrew Bible―who are said to be large and strong. The word \"Nephilim\" is narrowly translated as giants in some Bibles but left untranslated in others. They are mentioned in the following books: Genesis, Numbers, and Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible. The Nephilites and their identity are still unknown to this day. Numbers 13:33 says that they later lived in Canaan when Israel conquered Canaan. A similar Hebrew term, read as \"Nephilim\" by some scholars, or as the word \"fallen\" by others, appears in the Biblical book Ezekiel 32:27 ==What are the Nephilim== Some people think the Nephilim are giants that were created when fallen angels mated with humans, while others think they were famous ancient warriors and heroes that were created when the descendants of Seth wed the descendants of Cain. * * New American Bible, footnotes page 1370, referring to verse 6. : The angels too, who did not keep to their own domain but deserted their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains, in gloom, for the judgement of the great day. Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah, and the surrounding towns, which, in the same manner as they, indulged in sexual promiscuity and practiced unnatural vice, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. : —Jude 1:6–7, New American Bible. * Bob Deffinbaugh, Genesis: From Paradise to Patriarchs, The Sons of God and the Daughters of Men * \"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of the nobles would come to the daughters of man, and they would bear for them; they are the mighty men, who were of old, the men of renown.\"—Genesis 6:4 (chabad.org translation) * : Later Judaism and almost all the earliest ecclesiastical writers identify the \"sons of God\" with the fallen angels; but from the fourth century onwards, as the idea of angelic natures becomes less material, the Fathers commonly take the \"sons of God\" to be Seth's descendants and the \"daughters of men\" those of Cain. : —Jerusalem Bible, Genesis VI, footnote. * * Brown-Driver-Briggs thought that the Nephilim were giants.Brown, Francis; Driver, S. R.; Briggs, Charles A. (1907). A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament. p. 658; p. 658. Robert Baker Girdlestone thought that they are \"the ones that caused the downfall.\"Girdlestone R. (1871) Synonyms of the Old Testament: Their Bearing on Christian Faith and Practice. p. 91 Donald Hendel thinks that it means \"ones who have fallen.\" The majority of ancient biblical translations think they were \"giants.\" Symmachus thought they were \"the violent ones,\"The Greek translation reads ; the singular root means \"violence\" or \"forcible\" ( and Aquila thought they were either \"the fallen ones\" or \"the ones falling [on their enemies].\" Some Jews believe that the Nephilim had children called Elioud. Aramaics think that Nephilim refers to the children of Orion.e.g. Peake's commentary on the Bible 1919Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew Lexicon p. 658; Strongs H5307 J. C. Greenfield thinks that the Nephilim is based on bad things in Sumerian beliefs. Early Arabs thought that fallen angels were sent to Earth looking like men, and they mated with humans. ==Mentions of the Nephilim in the Hebrew Bible== In Genesis 6:4: > The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the > sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to > them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown. In Numbers 13:32–33: > And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; > and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight. In Ezekiel 32:27: > They lie with the warriors, the Nephilim of old, who descended to Sheol with > their weapons of war. They placed their swords beneath their heads and their > shields upon their bones, for the terror of the warriors was upon the land > of the living. ==Idea about the Nephilim's fossils== Cotton Mather thought that fossilized leg bones and teeth discovered near Albany, New York, in 1705, were the remains of Nephilim who died in a great flood, though paleontologists thought they were mastodon remains instead. ==References== ==Other websites== * Jewish Encyclopedia: Fall of Angels * Catholic Encyclopedia: Angels Category:Angels Category:Controversies Category:Demons Category:Old Testament people Category:Palestine",
