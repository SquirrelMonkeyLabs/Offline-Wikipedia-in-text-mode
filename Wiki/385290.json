These syllables are often an optional consonant sound (C) followed by a vowel sound (V) â€” that is, a CV or V syllable, however, there are examples of syllabaries with symbols for CVC, CV- tone, and C (normally nasal consonants) syllables. == History == == Short list of Syllabaries == * Canadian Aboriginal syllabics * Cherokee * Japanese Kana (Hiragana, Katakana) * Linear B * Old Persian Cuneiform Category:Writing systems",
