B. R. Ambedkar was not in support of the ABKKM because of the use of Kshatriya word and opposed the Koli leader by many ways. Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Koli Mahasabha was a social organisation initiated in Ajmer by a group of kolis of Rajasthan in 1927 and spread throughout the Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. Koli leaders of Mahasabha claimed Kshatriya status because of the Koli Princely states and Jagirs of Kolis in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh. At that time, there were 52 princely states of kolis in Gujarat but all of them were minor or petty states, several of koli principlities were in Maharashtra and Kullu state in Himachal. After the Independence of India from British rule in 1947, The leaders of Mahasabha in 1952 invited the Koli Maharaja Yashwantrao Martandrao Mukne of Jawhar state, Maharaja Deshmukh Dhairyashilrao Pawar of Surgana state and the Koli Thakurs of Jagirs in Gujarat to take a meating in Ajmer to discuss for upliftment of Koli society. Maharaja Mukne sent his Prime Minister to the meeting with a grateful thank. In 1939, The ABKKM published a book named Koli Kshatriya Jaati Ka Sanchhipta Parichay to promote the history of Kolis. this book was written by a Arya Samaji Nand Kumar Shastri and published by Ram Krishna Printing Press. == References == Category:Organizations based in India Category:1927 establishments in Asia Category:Koli people Category:British India",
