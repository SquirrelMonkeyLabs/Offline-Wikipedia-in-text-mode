The movie was recognized with a number of awards and nominations, including Academy Award nominations and Golden Globe wins for both Portman and Owen for their acting in supporting roles. The movie was written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name. == Plot == Ignoring a traffic light, Alice (Portman) crosses the street to the opposite side of the road and is hit by a car. The accidental witness of the incident, a failed writer Dan (Lowe), takes the girl to the doctor, but not only out of nobility â€” Alice is too beautiful to miss the chance to get to know her better. The couple's communication turned out to be quite fruitful: before that, Dan, who made his living writing obituaries, had written a book. The source of inspiration and prototype of the heroine was his roommate, Alice, to whom the writer remained faithful for a year. After meeting the expressive photographer Anna (Roberts), Dan begins to think about the benefits of diversity, but the flirtation, which Alice also becomes aware of, never ends. For fun, Dan introduces Anna to Larry (Owen), and soon the love triangle turns into a square. == Other websites == * == References == Category:2004 romantic drama movies Category:American romantic drama movies Category:BAFTA Award winning movies Category:2000s English-language movies Category:Golden Globe Award winning movies Category:Infidelity in movies Category:Movies directed by Mike Nichols Category:Movies set in London Category:American independent movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies",
