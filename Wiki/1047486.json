 "text": "The Kraków Ghetto was a specific section of Kraków where the Nazis forced Jews to live during the Holocaust. At the time, Kraków was in the General Government, a part of Poland that was occupied by Nazi Germany. Jews in Kraków were not allowed to live outside the ghetto. The Nazis liquidated the ghetto for the final time in March 1943. This meant they deported all of the ghetto's remaining Jews to extermination camps. (Many people were deported to the Bełżec death camp). Many Schutzstaffel (SS) guards participated in the liquidation. == Related pages == * Rubzewitz Ghetto * Warsaw Ghetto * Lwów Ghettos * Ghettos in Europe during the Holocaust Category:Kraków Category:Ghettos Category:1940s in Poland",
