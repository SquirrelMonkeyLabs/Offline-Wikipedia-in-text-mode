 "text": "Dubois' whipping frog or Dubois' tree frog (Zhangixalus duboisi) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and China. This frog lives in forests on hills and mountains. Sometimes it lives in places with evergreen trees or karst rocks in the ground. People have seen it next to ponds, swamps, and places where water comes out of the ground. People have seen this frog between 1210 and 2813 meters above sea level. The male frog digs a hole under a rock and then sings for the female frogs. The female frog lays her eggs in the hole. Sometimes the adult frogs stay near the eggs and stop other animals from eating them. The tadpoles move into the water after the eggs hatch. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of extinction because it lives in a small place. This frog is in danger because people change the places where the frogs live to build farms and things for visitors. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog. Because it lives high in mountains, the frog cannot move to colder places when the weather gets hotter the way animals that live in lower places could. Scientists think people might catch this frog to sell as a pet because it is so colorful, but they are not sure if this has happened yet. People have sold other colorful frogs in Zhangixalus and Rhacophorus as pets. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
