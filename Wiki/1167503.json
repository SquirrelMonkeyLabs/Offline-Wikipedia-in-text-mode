 "text": "Bahlol Lodi's tomb is a building situated in Delhi, India, which is allegedly the tomb of an emperor of the Delhi Sultanate and the founder of the Lodi Dynasty, Bahlul Khan Lodi (). It was built by Sikandar Khan, the son and successor of Bahlul Lodi after the demise of his father in July 1489 A.D.
