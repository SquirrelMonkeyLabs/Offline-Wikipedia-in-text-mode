 "text": "Broadacre City was a proposed development by Frank Lloyd Wright that would have given families one acre (0.40 hectare) each. It would have been an agrarian eutopia, part of the garden-city movement around four square miles or ten square kilometers in total size. The housing stock of Broadacre City would consist almost entirely of single family farmhouses. There would be a few office buildings and a train station, but it would primarily be a farming community. Almost all transportation would be done via private automobile, the city would be coal powered, and pedestrians would not be accommodated.
