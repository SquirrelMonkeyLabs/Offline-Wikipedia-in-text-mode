 "text": "Alabama's 7th congressional district is a United States congressional district in the state of Alabama that elects a representative to the United States House of Representatives. The district includes the counties of Choctaw, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Marengo, Pickens, Perry, Sumter and Wilcox. Parts of Clarke, Jefferson, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa counties are in the district. The district also has parts of the cities of Birmingham, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa/Northport city areas. The 7th congressional district is the only congressional district in Alabama to be represented by a Democrat. The representative is Terri Sewell. The district was created in 1843 and has only been represented by a Republican for 6 years. When the districts were being drawn again in 2010 the Republicans in Alabama drew the district to have many of the Democratic Party counties in Alabama so there would only be one Democratic congressional district in Alabama. This is called gerrymandering. ==Election history== Year Office Results 2000 President Gore 66–33% 2004 President Kerry 64–35% 2008 President Obama 72–27% 2012 President Obama 72–27% 2016 President Clinton 70–29% ==References== 07",
