 "text": "Izuku Midoriya is the main character from the manga and anime My Hero Academia. He is also known by his hero name Deku. He was created by Kōhei Horikoshi. Horikoshi had first created Midoriya as a sick salaryman that worked at a business which helped supply superheroes with costumes but he would later change him to be a high school boy instead. Midoriya was voiced by Daiki Yamashita in Japanese and by Justin Briner in English. Midoriya has appeared in many movies and video games for the series. He has also appeared as a character in Jump Force and as a crossover character along with Katsuki Bakugo, Ochaco Uraraka, and All Might in Fortnite Battle Royale. ==Biography== Midoriya is a high school boy. He has green hair and grows up idolizing superheroes. In the world, many people are born with superpowers called \"quirks\" but Midoriya is not one of them. He ends up getting bullied because of this. After a villain invades the town and trys to attack Katsuki Bakugo, one of Midoriya's bullies, Midoriya attempts to save him. This gives the superhero All Might time to defeat the distracted villain. All Might ends up taking him under his wing and making him his protégé after seeing his heroism. All Might ends up training him and giving him the title of the 9th holder of One-for-All after he eats a piece of All Might's hair. He would end up using this power for the first time when he saves Ochaco Uraraka from a crumbling building. He would break his arm in the progress but would end up passing the entry exam for UA. Midoriya would enter a sports festival against other members of the school. He would eventually be eliminated by Shoto Todoroki after he encouraged Todoroki to use his full power. Afterwards, Midoriya would choose his hero name to be Deku, the same name that he was called when he was bullied as a child. After a year at the school goes by, Midoriya would leave the campus. This was to try and keep both the school and his classmates safe after he learns that the villain All for One's apprentice Tomura Shigaraki is coming to take One-for-All. He would eventually be brought back by the students. ==Reception== Since his introduction, Midoriya has become a very popular and well liked character. He has often been placed on polls of Best or Most Popular Anime Characters. Midoriya has won many Crunchyroll Anime Awards. This includes \"Hero of the Year\" in 2017, \"Best Hero\" in 2018, \"Best Boy\" in 2020, and \"Best Fight Scene\" in 2021. ==References== Category:Anime characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2014 Category:Fictional Japanese people Category:Superheroes",
