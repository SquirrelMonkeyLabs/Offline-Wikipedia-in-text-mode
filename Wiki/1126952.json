 "text": "On 7 October 2000, 34-year-old Hanafi Mat Hassan, a bus driver with a criminal past, raped and murdered 24-year-old computer engineer Noor Suzaily Mukhtar near Bukit Tinggi, Klang in Selangor, Malaysia. Her body was found at a construction site, and an autopsy revealed she had been raped, sodomized, and strangled. Hanafi was arrested and, in April 2002, sentenced to death for murder and 20 years in prison with 12 strokes of the cane for rape. His appeals were rejected, and he was executed on 19 December 2008. The murder of Noor Suzaily Mukhtar shocked the public and made headlines. Many, including then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, condemned Hanafi Mat Hassan for his horrific actions. == References == Category:Violence against women Category:2000s murders in Asia Category:2000s crimes in Asia Category:Murder in the 2000s",
