 "text": "The green-back tree frog (Zhangixalus dorsoviridis) is a frog. It lives in China and Vietnam. This frog lives in forests on mountains, between 25 and 50 meters away from streams. People see it sitting 2-3 meters above the ground on ginger plants. People have seen this frog between 1500 and 2200 meters above sea level. The male frog digs a hole under a rock and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays her eggs in the hole. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles go to the stream or other water hole. Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because it does not live in a very large place. People cut down forests to build things for visitors and farms, for example cardamom farms. Scientists think people might catch this frog to sell as a pet because of its colors. They do not know for sure if this has happened to Z. dorsoviridis, but people do this with other colorful frogs. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Hoang Lien National Park, Copia Nature Reserve, and Bat Xat Nature Reserve. Scientists think it could live in Jinpingfenshuiling Nature Reserve and Guanyinshan Nature Reserve too. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
