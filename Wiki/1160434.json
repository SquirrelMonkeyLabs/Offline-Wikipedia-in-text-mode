Sto tomas, Tuba, Benguet, Philippines under Baguio City. ==History== ===Inception (1967-1972)=== The station came into existence in 1967 as DZRI- TV, the first television station in Northern Luzon. DZRI-TV was launched following the merger of ABS-CBN's predecessors, Alto Broadcasting System and Chronicle Broadcasting Network. The station started on VHF channel 10 with a transmitting power of 500 watts. At the time, it served as a sister to former AM station DZBC, which opened in 1964. In 1969, VHF Channel 10 broadcast the Seven Last Words from the Baguio Cathedral to viewers in Metro Manila and Pangasinan via microwave relay. This method was done before the introduction of the nationwide satellite broadcasting system. The first such broadcast made ABS-CBN the pioneer in nationwide broadcasting. ===Martial Law era; move to channel 3 (1972-1986)=== When then 10th Philippine president Ferdinand E. Marcos of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte Province declared Martial Law, forcing ABS-CBN to shut down under his crony, Roberto Benedicto, DZRI-TV was subsequently shut down in 1972. That became the station's last year on the original Channel 10 frequency. Eight years later, in 1980, VHF Channel 10 was handed over to the newly launched station DZEA-TV . While the intellectual unit of the closed network was taken over by the crony-owned Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation, Benedicto moved the station's VHF allocation from VHF channel 10 to the current channel 3. Two years later, the state-run State Television (the basis of today's People's Television Network ) began broadcasting programs from Manila, as well as occasional local content, via channel 3; with the commercial BBC on its newly purchased DWZM-TV VHF channel 8, also a victim of the Marcos crackdown. ===ABS-CBN's revival; expansion across North Luzon (1986-2020)=== In September 1986, months after ABS-CBN was reinstated as a result of the victory of the EDSA People Power Revolution last February, the network took back DZRI-TV on its current frequency. The former BBC and GTV's successor, Maharlika Broadcasting System, were shut down and merged as the state-run PTV, which now operates on the former BBC VHF Channel 8 frequency. On August 1, 1988, ABS-CBN's own variation of DZRI-TV's star-ident network, featuring a gold tri-ribbon VHF channel 3 with a gold star on the lower tail (similar to the one used in Cebu) debuted, and with it came a new callsign: D-3-ZO-TV. It later changed to the red, green, and blue stripe. At that time, programming was scheduled differently until 1989, when Baguio VHF channel 4 officially became a satellite relay of the network's flagship DWWX-TV Manila, allowing it to operate concurrently with the network's programming; in addition to becoming a hub for viewers in the Cordillera and Ilocos regions. On January 27, 1992, D-3-ZO-TV became an originating station in preparation for the launch of ABS-CBN's Regional Radio/TV Network division (renamed Regional Network Group in 1995). On October 2, 1995, TV Patrol Baguio (now TV Patrol North Luzon), became the flagship newscast of the station and its surrounding regions and for a brief period in the late 90s, it also aired its own original drama series. Since then, Channel 3 Baguio expanded its local programming influence to the Cordillera and later to Northern & Central Luzon, culminating in 2018 with the formation of the networkâ€™s Northern Luzon Super Region with Channel 3 Baguio as its main broadcast hub. ===New call sign to DWAY-TV owned by AMBS's ALLTV2 Channel 3 Baguio (2024-present)=== The call sign for DWAY-TV, owned by AMBS's ALLTV2 Channel 3 Baguio, remains DWAY-TV. * DWAY-TV was previously known as D-3-ZO-TV and ABS-CBN TV 3 Baguio (or ABS-CBN North Luzon). * After the 4-year shutdown in May 5, 2020, it was acquired by Advanced Media Broadcasting System (AMBS) and rebranded as ALLTV2 Channel 3 Baguio. similar DZMV-TV formerly as DWWX-TV previously aired a full range of ABS-CBN 2 Mega Manila programs.
