 "text": "Marram grass is Ammophila, a genus of grasses. They are xerophytes, which live in dry places. Marram specialises in being the first line of land plants in coastal sand dunes. Ammophila has roots up to metres long. They find the moisture below the dry sand. These plants are used to stop sand-blow, because their roots hold the sand, and stop the wind blowing it away. Marram grass feels like long AstroTurf and feels almost rubbery. Category:Poaceae",
