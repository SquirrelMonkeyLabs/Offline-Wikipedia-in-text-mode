He served as Minister for Tourism and Trade from 1994 to 1997. He is also a two-term Vice President of the European People's Party. Kenny has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo since 1975, having succeeded his father Henry Kenny. He is the longest-serving TD currently in Dáil Éireann, which makes him the incumbent Father of the Dáil. Kenny led Fine Gael in the 2011 general election. He subsequently brokered an agreement with the Labour Party and formed a coalition government on 9 March 2011. He is Fine Gael's first Taoiseach since John Bruton from 1994 to 1997, and the first Fine Gael leader to win government in an election since Garret FitzGerald in 1982. In May 2017, Kenny announced he will retire as Fine Gael leader and will resign as Taoiseach once a new leader is chosen. ==References== ==Other websites== * Enda Kenny's page on the Fine Gael website * Enda's address to the nation: Sunday 4 December 2011 Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:County Mayo Category:Members of Fine Gael Category:Taoisigh of Ireland Category:Leaders of the Opposition (Ireland)",
