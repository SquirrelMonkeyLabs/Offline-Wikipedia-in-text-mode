 "text": "On 14 October 2023, Wadea al-Fayoum, a six-year-old Palestinian-American child, was killed when he was stabbed 26 times in his home in Plainfield, Illinois, in an event that authorities described as an anti-Muslim and anti- Palestinian attack. His mother Hanaan Shahin (32 years old) was also stabbed and suffocated, resulting in serious injuries. Authorities have described the killing as a hate crime motivated by Islamophobia, anti-Palestinianism and due to watching propaganda videos in the context of 2023 Israelâ€“Hamas war. ==Aftermath== The suspect, 71-year-old Joseph M. Czuba, has been arrested and charged with murder, attempted murder and hate crimes. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Shortly after his death, a vigil for al-Fayoume was held at a local basketball court in Plainfield to mark his love for the sport. ==References== Category:Arab-American history Category:2020s crimes in the United States Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:Incidents of violence against women",
