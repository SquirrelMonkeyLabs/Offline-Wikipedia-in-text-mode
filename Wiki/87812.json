 "text": "A cart is a vehicle with two wheels and usually pulled by one horse. Other animals such as ox, cattle or donkeys are sometimes used instead of a horse. A handcart is pulled or pushed by a person. Carts have been used for over 4,000 years around the world. Today we use the shopping cart. Shopping carts first made their appearance in Oklahoma City in 1937. ==Gallery== Image:Cart.jpg|A charrette, a wooden French cart (CÃ©vennes).
