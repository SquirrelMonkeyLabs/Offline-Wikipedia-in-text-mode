 "text": "The asthenosphere is part of earth's mantle. It is about 100 km to 350 km under the surface. It is the lower part of the upper mantle, and behaves as a hot viscous liquid. It consists of hot, weak material that can be deformed like silly putty. That means it is capable of gradual flow. It is under the lithosphere. == References == Category:Structure of the Earth",
