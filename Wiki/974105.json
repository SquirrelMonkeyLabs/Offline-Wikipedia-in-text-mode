 "text": "Olivia Travel is an American travel company. It sells travel tours to lesbian clients. It was founded in 1973 as the women's record label Olivia Records. In 1990 it offered its first women-only cruise. Olivia takes its name from the main heroine of the novel Dorothy Bassey, who fell in love with her headmistress. The company attracted attention thanks to the support of lesbian famous people such as golfer Rosie Jones, tennis player Martina Navratilova and basketball player Cheryl Swoopes. Artists who have performed on Olivia cruises include the Indigo Girls and Margaret Cho. == References == Category:Companies of the United States",
