He was shot twice from behind with an improvised shotgun, hitting his chest and neck. Abe was transported to a local hospital unconscious.

The doctors said that because he had lost a lot of blood, and the bullet had gone in deep enough to enter his heart. This news was reported by the public broadcaster NHK citing the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. It was also reported in a news conference at the medical hospital. The police autopsy found that Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone. ==Suspect== Tetsuya Yamagami, the shooter, was arrested by police at the scene. Yamagami had created the shotgun used for the attack. Yamagami was a former member of the Maritime Self-Defense Force from 2002 to 2005. Yamagami told investigators that he wanted to kill Abe because of a personal bad feelings toward a \"certain religious group\" (the Unification- Church, a branch of Christianity) that Abe had supported. He said that this religious group had \"brainwashed\" his mother and that killing Abe was not because of his political beliefs. ==Aftermath== Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who was in Yamagata Prefecture for the election campaign, cancelled campaigning and returned to Tokyo to deliver a national address, as did other Kishida cabinet members. In his speech, he said that Abe was in critical condition and called the shooting \"unforgivable\".Shinzo Abe shooting unforgiveable Many world leaders reacted to the shooting by hoping Abe recovered and condemned the shooting such as Emmanuel Macron, Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau, Jacinda Ardern, Boris Johnson, Anthony Albanese, Narendra Modi, Joseph M.
