 "text": "Vinoba Bhave (1895-1982), was a philosopher and revolutionist of India. Often called Acharya (Sanskrit for teacher). He was a pupil of Mahatma Gandhi (1869~ 1948), who was called \"Mahatma\", meaning a great sage. Vinoba Bhave also lived following the doctrine of ahimsa, which means nonviolence. His ideas were also influenced by his grandfather, father, and mother. His grandfather taught him about the purity of spirit. His father, who was yoga ascetic, taught him how to think scientifically. His mother taught him what faith is. He got the Bharat Ratna award by Indian government in 1983. The Gita has also been translated into Marathi language by him with the name as Geetai means mother Geeta.[2] There are a lot of accomplishments he made. The most famous thing is \"Budan\", which is an idea of sharing lands with the poor. He argued that land is not something that can be occupied. He insisted that land owners should donate their one sixth of their land to people who do not have land. He campaigned to give rice to hungry people. And he also did a campaign of self- supporting and self-sufficient. These worked successfully and he became a great man of India.
