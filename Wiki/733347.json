 "text": "The impeachment process against Richard Nixon began in the United States House of Representatives on October 30, 1973, following the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" episode of the Watergate scandal. The House Committee on the Judiciary set up impeachment inquiry staff and began investigations into possible impeachable offenses by Richard Nixon, the 37th president of the United States. The process began on February 6, 1974, when the House granted the Judiciary Committee authority to investigate whether sufficient grounds existed to impeach President Nixon of high crimes and misdemeanors under Article II, Section 4, of the United States Constitution. This investigation happened one year after the United States Senate created the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel in Washington, D.C.. On August 9, 1974, before the full House could vote on the articles of impeachment, Nixon resigned. This ended the impeachment process. ==References== Category:1974 in the United States Category:Watergate scandal Category:Richard Nixon Category:Impeachment in the United States",
