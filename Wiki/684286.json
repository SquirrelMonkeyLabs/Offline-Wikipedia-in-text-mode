 "text": "The Almendares River is a 45 km river in the western part of Cuba. It originates from the east of Tapaste and flows north-west into the Straits of Florida. The river is a water supply for Havana. The river divides two districts of Havana: the Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n (Miramar) and Playa (Vedado). Part of the river valley forms the Almendares Park or Metropolitan Park of Havana (PMH), a few kilometers upstream from the ocean. There are several industrial plants along the river banks (paper mills, gas production plants, brewery, food production plants, construction plants). The Havana authorities continue to monitor and control water pollution, reduce and rationalize industrial occupation, maintain the old trees and the vegetation in the park. The area is gradually becoming a green oasis with playground, a few restaurants and footpaths. ==References== Category:Rivers of North America Category:Geography of Cuba",
