 "text": "Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco ( born 1477 or 1478, died 1510) was a Venetian painter. He is commonly known as Giorgione. He died a little over 30, probably of the plague. Today, only about six paintings can be clearly attributed to him. This makes him one of the most mysterious painters of his time. Together with Titian he was one of the most influential painters of his period. He was one of the first Venitian Painters to use Oil Paints for a medium. ==Related pages== * List of Italian painters Category:1470s births Category:1510 deaths Category:15th-century Italian painters",
