 "text": "Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson (29 September 1758 – 21 October 1805) was an British sea captain in the Royal Navy. Born at the rectory of the village of Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, Nelson commanded the British fleet during the Napoleonic Wars, fighting the French and the Spanish. Nelson was blind in one eye after he had been wounded in battle.N.A.M. Rodger, ‘Nelson, Horatio, Viscount Nelson (1758–1805)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004; online edn, May 2009 accessed 5 Oct 2009 During the Battle of Trafalgar, his greatest victory, he was killed by a French sniper. ==Last words== At least three versions of his last words exist and are shown in Wikiquote. His most well-known last words are \"Kiss me, Hardy\". Another statement during his last hours was \"Thank God I have done my duty.\" An alternative version is that he said both of those statements. He said \"Kiss me, Hardy,\" When Hardy kissed him on the cheek. Then, Nelson said, \"Now I am satisfied. Thank God I have done my duty.\" Next, Hardy kissed him again on the forehead, when Nelson called out, \"Who is that?\" Hardy replied, \"It is Hardy.\" Nelson said, \"God bless you, Hardy.\" Finally, he murmoured to those around him to look after Emma Hamilton and his daughter. Most recently, accounts of his chaplain, Alexander Scott; his steward, Chevalier; and the purser, Walter Burke state that Nelson said, \"Drink, drink. Fan, fan. Rub, rub.\" That was a request to ease the symptoms of thirst, heat, and the pains of his wounds. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded Nelson's last words as \"God and my country.\"p. 63 == References == Category:1758 births Category:1805 deaths Category:British admirals Category:British Barons Category:British Viscounts Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:People from Norfolk Category:United Kingdom Barons Category:United Kingdom Viscounts",
