 "text": "Online antisemitism refers to antisemitism on the Internet. ==Overview== Since the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, has been a major issue, with significant real-world impact. Antisemitism is common on the most visited websites worldwide, including Wikipedia, * * * * * * * * * * Reddit * * * * * and Instagram. * * * * * * * * * * On January 27, 2025, the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Cloudfare said that they had stopped over 47 million cyberthreats against Jewish and Holocaust education websites, noting that the cyberthreats were associated with \"a troubling resurgence of antisemitism [...] spilled into the digital realm\". ==Research== With at least 66% of the world population using the internet and social media, antisemitic tropes are circulated more easily than in ancient times to influence public opinion about Jews in different regions while the Holocaust ‒ the systematic genocide of at least 6,000,000 Jews (67% of pre-war European Jews) by the Axis powers in WWII * * * * * * * * * * ‒ fades out of public memory. ===UNESCO=== On January 23, 2025, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) said in a press release that a UNESCO study found 16% of all Holocaust-related content across social media to be denying or distorting. Distortion of the Holocaust refers, inter alia, to: * * * ===ADL=== The phenomenon is shown in a global survey (58,000 respondents) conducted by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in late 2024, which found that 46% of the world's adult population (around 2,200,000,000 people) held deeply entrenched antisemitic views. Among the respondents, 56% thought that Jews were \"only loyal to Israel\" while 46% \"Jews had too much power over global affairs\". 76% of those in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) are found to agree with 11 negative stereotypes of Jews, the highest of all regions. Meanwhile, Kuwait and Indonesia are found to be the most antisemitic sovereign states. Regarding the Holocaust, only 48% of the respondents recognized its historical accuracy, with the percentage being the lowest (39%) among the age group 18–34, contrary to the common academic leftist belief that the young is least likely to be racist. ==Reddit== Reddit, as the largest forum in the world, has been a subject of controversy due to the presence of subreddits devoted to disinformation and explicit materials, including subreddits r/Creepshots, r/jailbait, and r/greenandpleasant. Reddit has also been long been criticized for uncontrolled antisemitism. * * * * * Antisemites, especially Holocaust deniers, * * * * * across the political spectrum are active on Reddit. On February 20, 2025, an independent journalist announced his findings that over 110 subreddits were controlled by around 30 users who took advantage of the forum's loopholes to systematically distribute antisemitic disinformation for terrorist groups.The Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The methods involved \"vote brigading, subreddit moderation, and content manipulation\". Reportedly, the compromised subreddits include r/Documentaries (20M members), r/therewasanattempt (7.2M), r/PublicFreakout (4.7M), r/Fauxmoi (4.3M), r/MorbidReality (1.1M), r/ToiletPaperUSA (440K), r/Thatsactuallyverycool (277K), r/Palestine (270K), r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM (184K) and r/boringdystopia (94K), from which misinformation was funnelled to smaller subreddits and beyond Reddit to influence public opinion, while alerts to the company were repeatedly ignored. In particular, the journalist noted: ==Instagram== Antisemitism is also common on Instagram. Some celebrities, including Israeli Jewish actresses Gal Gadot * * * * * and Noa Cohen, * * * * * are also victims, who have to restrict commenting on their Instagram profiles to reduce antisemitic harassment from purported pro-Palestinian groups. ==Wikipedia== ===Croatian Wikipedia=== Between 2009 and 2021, Croatian Wikipedia was controlled by a group of far-right administrators who promoted Holocaust denial by censoring the war crimes of the pro-Nazi Ustaše-ruled Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and blocking dozens of rule-abiding users for trying to remove the false content. Željko Jovanović, the Minister of Science of Croatia back then, also advised against the use of the Croatian Wikipedia. The most serious violation by the far-right administrators was their anti-historical designation of the Jasenovac concentration camp, in which 77,000–99,000 were killed, * * * * * as a \"collection camp\". Their Holocaust denial was condemned by scholars, officials, advocacy groups and media critics. Following a year-long investigation (2020–21) by the Wikimedia Foundation, several complicit users and administrators were either banned or demoted, with one of the administrators found to have consolidated his or her power with 80 sockpuppet accounts. ===English Wikipedia=== The English Wikipedia was criticized for condoning the systematic whitewashing of Nazi war criminals in thousands of WWII-related articles. * * * * * For instance, Arthur Nebe, a senior SS official who invented mobile gas chambers to kill Jews, was portrayed as a savior of Jews based on distortion of a cited source that actually said the opposite, while false claims of Nazi war criminals \"opposing\" Hitler were made. SS units responsible for the Holocaust were either depicted as brave fighters or described in passive voice to make their atrocities look normal. Those who corrected the false content had also faced persistent harassment from pro-Nazi users, some of whom were found to have repeatedly cited materials from Holocaust-denying sources (e.g. Journal of Historical Review, Nation Europa and Franz Kurowski) misrepresented them as academic consensus and gamed the rules to prevent the removal of such content. The violations continued for years with limited administrative intervention, which mainstreamed Nazi sympathy among young readers and hurt efforts to preserve the Holocaust's historical truth. German military historian Jens Westemeier commented on the issue, In 2023, Holocaust historians Profs. Jan Grabowski and Shira Klein * * * published the 57-page article Wikipedia's Intentional Distortion of the History of the Holocaust in The Journal of Holocaust Research wherein they reported to have found widespread distortion of Poland's Holocaust history on the English Wikipedia, which involved the exaggeration of Jewish collaboration with Nazi/Soviet occupiers, invention of Jewish \"war crimes\" against Poles, downplaying of Polish collaboration with Nazi/Soviet occupiers, and blaming Jews for their own suffering: [[File:Bialystok-following-1939-So.jpg|thumb|A photo that (in this version) is featured as figure 1 in the paper, with the caption \"Photograph of a sign in Białystok, wrongly captioned as a Jewish welcoming banner for the Soviets\" (referring to this edit)]] Prof. Grabowski and Dr. Klein also criticized English Wikipedia's administrators and the Wikimedia Foundation's lack of will to handle, leaving the site vulnerable to disinformation: On another occasion, Prof. Grabowski said, Some misconceptions about the Holocaust in Poland are summarized as follows: Attribute Summary Death toll Myth 1: \"3 million non-Jewish Poles were killed in WWII.\"Wikipedia article, “Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust,” Wikipedia, revision from 8:06, May 24, 2022, Fact: The number was claimed in 1946 by Jakub Berman, the head of the Polish communist secret police, to create a false equivalence between Jewish and Polish victimhood.Karyn Ball and Per Anders Rudling, “The Underbelly of Canadian Multiculturalism: Holocaust Obfuscation and Envy in the Debate about the Canadian Museum for Human Rights,” Holocaust Studies, vol. 20, no. 3 (2014): pp. 33–80. The death toll of non-Jewish Poles was 1.8 million as per the most recent estimates.C. Łuczak, “Szanse i trudności bilansu demograficznego Polski w latach 1939–1945,” Dzieje Najnowsze 2 (1994): pp. 9–15. Scale of helping Jews Myth 2: \"Thousands of Poles were executed for helping Jews.\" Fact: 800 Poles were executed for helping Jews as per the most recent estimates.Ryszard Walczak et al. (eds.), Those Who Helped: Polish Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust (Warszawa: IPN, 1997).Martyna Grądzka-Rejak and Aleksandra Namysło, (eds.), Represje za pomoc Żydom na okupowanych ziemiach polskich w czasie II wojny światowej, vol. 1 (Warsaw: IPN, 2019), p. 464. Scale of hiding Jews Myth 3: \"450,000 Poles hid Jews in their houses during the Holocaust.\"Richard C. Lukas, Out of the Inferno: Poles Remember the Holocaust (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1989), p. 15. Fact: The number was promoted by Władysław Żarski-Zajdler, a writer propagandizing for the Polish communist regime during the 1968 antisemitic campaign. Fewer than 30,000 Polish Jews survived the Holocaust.Natalia Sawka, “Antysemita Leszek Żebrowski poprowadzi wykład o ‘żołnierzach wyklętych,’” Gazeta Wyborcza, March 1, 2016 Scale of Polish collaboration Myth 4: \"<1% Poles collaborated with Nazi occupiers.\"The “Israeli War Crimes Commission” statistics seem to originate from an essay from the 1960s by one Leo Heiman, which provides no footnote. Leo Heiman, “Ukrainians and the Jews,” in Ukrainians and Jews, Articles, Testimonies, Letters and Official Documents Dealing with Interrelations of Ukrainians and Jews in the Past and Present: A Symposium (New York: The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, 1966), p. 60. Fact: Several independent research showed otherwise.Machcewicz and Persak, (eds.), Wokół Jedwabnego; Jan Grabowski and Barbara Engelking, (eds.), Dalej jest noc: losy Żydów w wybranych powiatach okupowanej Polski (Night Without End: The Fate of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland), 2 vols. (Warsaw: Polish Center for Holocaust Research, 2018). Polish Blue Police Myth 5: \"Many Polish Blue Police were executed for refusing to follow Nazi orders to arrest Jews.\"Engelking and Grabowski, (eds.), Dalej jest noc; Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe, “Polnische Bürgermeister und der Holocaust im Generalgouvernement Besatzung, Kollaboration und Handlungsmöglichkeiten,” Bulletin des Fritz Bauer Instituts, (2021), pp. 26–35. Fact: Proven cases have not been found by mainstream historians yet. Instead, the Polish Blue Police helped Nazi occupiers kill Jews enthusiastically. * * * Polish Underground State Myth 6: \"The Polish Underground State's court investigated 17,000 suspected Polish collaborators and sentenced 3,500 to death.\" Fact: No more than seven collaborators were sentenced to death by the Polish Underground State's court,Andrzej Żbikowski, Polacy i Zydzi pod okupacja niemiecką, 1939-1945: Studia i Materiały (Warsaw: IPN, 2006), pp. 482–84. despite desperate requests from the Committee to Aid Jews (Żegota). Policies against helping Jews Myth 7: \"Poles were specifically targeted by the Nazis for helping Jews. The Nazis imposed death penalty on Poles because of this.\" Fact: Nazi laws against helping Jews were applied equally to millions of non- German subjects under Nazi occupation.The Third Decree of General Governor Hans Frank concerning restrictions on residency in the Generalgouvernement and introducing the death penalty for aid rendered to Jews, October 15, 1941; Verordnungsblatt für das Generalgouvernement. Dziennik Rozporządzeń dla Generalnego Gubernatorstwa, Cracow, October 25, 1941, p. 595. The death penalty was introduced on October 15, 1941, long before any obvious help could have been noticed. Revelation of the Holocaust Myth 8: \"Polish Army officer Witold Pilecki told the Allies about the Holocaust via Polish government-in- exile courier Jan Karski.\" Fact: Jan Karski did not tell the Allies about the Holocaust.Adam Puławski, “Revisiting Jan Karski’s Final Mission,” Israeli Journal of Foreign Affairs, vol. 15, no. 2 (2021): pp. 289–97; Adam Puławski, Wobec niespotykanego w dziejach mordu. Rząd RP na uchodźstwie, Delegatura Rządu RP na Kraj, AK a eksterminacja ludności żydowskiej od wielkiej akcji do powstania w getcie warszawskim (Chełm: Stowarzyszenie Rocznik Chełmski, 2018). Karski left Poland in fall 1942, while Pilecki did not write a report about the Holocaust until summer 1943, when most Polish Jews had already been killed. Pilecki could not have given Karski a report that did not exist when Karski left. Nazi reprisals against Poles helping Jews Myth 9: \"The Nazi murdered 20,000 Polish villagers in Białka over some of them helping Jews.\"Wikipedia article, “Nazi Crimes Against the Polish Nation,” Wikipedia, revision from 14:14, June 15, 2022, Fact: It is true that individual shootings of Białka's Polish villagers happened, but the confirmed death toll was 96.Geoffrey P. Megargee, ed., Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933-1945, vol. 1: Early Camps, Youth Camps, and Concentration Camps and Subcamps under the SS-Business Administration Main Office (WVHA) (Washington: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2009), p. 692. Post-war pogroms against Jews Myth 10: \"The July 1946 Kielce pogrom was planned by the Soviet occupiers.\" Fact: The claim has been roundly rejected by mainstream scholars, including Joanna Tokarska-Bakir who won the 2019 Yad Vashem International Book Award for a book that disproved the claim, which is only held by some Polish nationalists and conspiracy theorists. In 2024, independent journalists uncovered a large-scale off-site canvassing campaign to rewrite Jewish history and reshape the narrative surrounding the Israel–Palestine conflict, which involved 40 accounts having made at least 2,000,000 edits to over 10,000 Jewish-related articles. * * * The off-site canvassing campaign was coordinated by an 8,000-member Tech for Palestine Discord channel, where the organizers provided the participants in-depth training (e.g. strategy planning sessions, group audio \"office hour\" chats) on getting used to Wikipedia's site operation, assigning participants (in groups of 2~3) to edit hundreds of articles in rotation and gaming the rules to block others from correcting them. Reported examples of their revisionist * * * edits include Summary Edits * Removal of \"Land of Israel\" from the origin of Jews in Jewish-related articles * Removal of mentions of 16th century Jewish immigration to Israel in Jewish-related articles * Removal of mentions of Hamas' 1988 charter which involved the incitement to mass murder of Jews * Removal of mentions of the Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem's alliance with Hitler * * * * * * * * * * in Holocaust-related articles * Redefinition of Jews as an \"ethnoreligious group and cultural community\" from \"ethnoreligious group and nation from the Levant\" in Jewish-related articles On 12 December 2024, English Wikipedia's arbitration committee announced that two editors * * had been site-banned indefinitely for off-site canvassing and \"encouraging other users to game the extended confirmed restriction and engage in disruptive editing.\" Another three editors have also been sanctioned for similar reasons. On January 17, 2025, English Wikipedia's arbitration committee further voted to impose indefinite topic-bans on multiple longtime editors associated with the organized campaign. * * * * ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt commented, ==Related pages== * Khazar myth * Polish Memory Law * Antisemitism in Europe * Secondary antisemitism * Nation of Islam and racism ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Antisemitism Category:Social networking Category:21st century in Asia Category:21st century in Europe Category:21st century in the United States Category:21st century in the United Kingdom",
