 "text": "After capturing Etawah in 1773 Shuja ud Daula planned an expedition of Bundelkhand supported by the Rana of Gohad who was given the title of \"Son\" by Nawab he sent Naim Khan and Fazal Ali Khan to Bundelkhand. The Invaders met the Maratha Forces at Kapli. The strong force of 30000 under Naim Khan clashed with 2700 Marathas under Gangadhar Pant Bundele and Balaji Pant Bundele the sons of late Govind Pant Bundele inspite of outnumbered the Marathas defeated the enemy and made them flee accross Yamuna. ==Battle== After Shuja conquered Etawah, his wazir invited Rana Madeo Singh from Gohad to join his service. Together, they planned a campaign to capture Kalpi and nearby areas, which were still controlled by the Marathas. At the time, the Marathas in the north were isolated due to internal conflicts in Pune and had little support. The wazir also formed an alliance with the Rana of Gohad, who visited Etawah and was given the honorary title of \"son.\" Once preparations were finished, Naim Khan, a commander under Sabit Khan, was chosen to lead the campaign. He was given the title Naim-ud-Daulah Sabit Jung and sent with Rene Madec at the head of an army of 30,000 soldiers, including cavalry and infantry. News of their large force spread, causing panic among Gangadhar and Balaji, the sons of Govind Pant Bundele, who were defending Kalpi. They abandoned the fort and retreated further into the countryside. When the invading army arrived, the Marathas decided to fight near Kalpi. Despite being heavily outnumbered – with only 2,700 soldiers against 30,000 the Marathas managed to defeat Naim Khan’s forces and forced them to retreat across the Jamuna River. ==Aftermath== Despite help from the Rana of Gohad, Naim retreated in great confusion, which angered the wazir. The wazir was so upset that he briefly considered executing Naim by blowing him from a cannon and personally leading an attack on Bundelkhand to punish Govind Pant's sons for their boldness. However, this plan was abandoned because it was urgent to focus on defeating Rohillakhand. Naim was forgiven, and Basant, along with his troops, was sent across the Jamuna River to take control of Ater and stop the Bundelas from causing trouble in the wazir's territory after their recent victory. Basant successfully completed the mission and returned to the wazir before the Rohillakhand campaign ended. == References == Category:Maratha Empire",
