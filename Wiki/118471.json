 "text": "Load is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on June 4, 1996, by Elektra Records in the United States and by Vertigo Records internationally. Four singles were released from the album. It has sold over 5 million copies in the US. The album showed more of a hard rock side of Metallica than the band's typical thrash metal style. This alienated much of the band's fanbase. It's influenced by genres such as southern rock, blues rock, country rock, and alternative rock. At 79 minutes, Load is Metallica's longest studio album. ==Track Listing== # Ain't My Bitch # 2x4 # The House Jack Built # Until It Sleeps # King Nothing # Hero of the Day # Bleeding Me # Cure # Poor Twisted Me # Wasting My Hate # Mama Said # Thorn Within # Ronnie # The Outlaw Torn ==References== Category:Metallica albums Category:1996 albums",
