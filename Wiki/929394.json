 "text": "Life extension (also indefinite life extension or biological immortality) is the catch-all term for drastically increasing people's lifespans by halting or reversing aging. Because aging has multiple causes and symptoms, any successful indefinite life extension program would have to include multiple medications, supplement pills, therapies and other procedures. It could even include molecular nanobots to repair damage brought on by aging. This life expectancy extension is currently impossible but futurists say such procedures, therapies, etc. should be available in the 2030s or 2040s. Category:Medicine Category:Transhumanism",
