The diversity of artistic expressions created over more than two centuries reflects the unique experiences and backgrounds of the artists involved. Some artists draw inspiration from African cultural traditions and other regions influenced by the Black diaspora, while others look to traditional African-American forms of plastic arts, such as basket weaving, pottery, quilting, woodcarving, and painting. These forms are often categorized under the terms \"handicrafts\" or \"folk art.\" Category:African-American culture",
