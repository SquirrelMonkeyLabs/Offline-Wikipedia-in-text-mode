It was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley for the London North Eastern Railway. 35 locomotives were built in total.They were designed to be very fast and had a very sleek shape. One of them, 4468 \"Mallard\", is the fastest steam locomotive ever made. It set a world speed record of 126 mph (202.7 km/h) on July 3, 1938 before the start of World War 2 in 1939 .Six A4s still exist today. The rest were scrapped when steam stopped being used to power trains in Britain in the 1960’s while one locomotive was destroyed by the German Wehrmacht (Military)’s Luftwaffe (Air Force) back in 1942 during World War 2 . 4 are preserved in Britain in Europe while 2 are preserved in North America (1 in Canada and 1 in America) ==Sources== ==Other websites== * LNER Encyclopedia Page covering the history and development of the LNER A4 Pacifics Category:United Kingdom rolling stock",
