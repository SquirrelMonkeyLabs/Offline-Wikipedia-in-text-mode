 "text": "\"Fight Like a Brave\" is a song by Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was a single from their third album, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. The single also had a cover version of \"Fire\" by Jimi Hendrix on it. This cover was later on The Abbey Road E.P. and Mother's Milk. The song was put on these albums for Hillel Slovak, the guitar player for the band who died in 1988. Most of the words in the song are about Anthony Kiedis' addiction to heroin. Kiedis used drugs many times. When this was worst, Flea made him leave the band. He was not going to let him join again unless he stopped using drugs. Kiedis went to Michigan to stop using drugs. He went to a treatment place owned by The Salvation Army. When he stopped using drugs, he went back to Los Angeles to join the band again. He wrote \"Fight Like a Brave\" on the plane going to Los Angeles. == Track listing == The single has been released on many different things.
