 "text": "Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) is a science fiction movie. It was written and directed by Ed Wood and shot in 1957. It stars Gregory Walcott, Mona McKinnon, Lyle Talbot, Tor Johnson, Maila Nurmi (Vampira), and Criswell. Some footage of Bela Lugosi as the \"Old Man\" was edited into the movie after Lugosi's death. The movie is about aliens who want to stop humans from creating a weapon that will destroy the universe. To do this, the aliens put their \"Plan 9\" in operation. This is a scheme to bring Earth's dead back to life. This plan will get Earth's attention and chaos will follow. For years, the movie was aired on television without much notice. In 1980 authors Michael Medved and Harry Medved called Plan 9 from Outer Space the \"worst movie ever made\". They posthumously awarded their Golden Turkey Award to Wood as the worst director ever. == Cast == ===Earthlings=== * Gregory Walcott as Jeff Trent, an airline pilot * Mona McKinnon as Paula Trent, Jeff's wife * Lyle Talbot as General Roberts * Duke Moore as Lt.
