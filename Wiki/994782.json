 "text": "Rafael Alexandre da Conceição Leão (; born 10 June 1999) is a Portuguese footballer. He plays as a forward for Serie A club AC Milan and the Portugal national team. Leão made his first-team debut in 2018 after graduating from the Sporting CP youth system, winning the 2017–18 Taça da Liga. He terminated his contract because of an incident in the club. Shortly after, he joined Ligue 1 club Lilie on a free transfer. AC Milan signed him in 2019 for a reported fee of €35 million. In his third season in the club, he helped them win the 2021–22 Serie A, which ended the club's lack of league titles for 11-years. He was also voted Serie A Most Valuable Player and was listed among the 30-man shortlist for the Ballon d'Or. == References == Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Living people Category:1999 births Category:A.C.
