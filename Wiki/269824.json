 "text": "Aliens is a American science fiction-action horror movie released in 1986. It is a science fiction movie because it takes place in outer space and there are alien creatures. It was directed by James Cameron and stars Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen. Aliens is a sequel to Alien (1979) and was followed by two more sequels; AlienÂ³ (1992) and Alien: Resurrection (1997). This one is different than the original movie because instead of it being just a horror movie, it has more action in it and there is more than one alien in it, as said in the title of the movie. ==Other websites== * Category:1986 horror movies Category:1986 science fiction movies Category:1986 action movies Category:1980s monster movies Category:1980s science fiction horror movies Category:1980s sequel movies Category:20th Century Fox movies Category:Alien movies Category:1980s American action movies Category:American monster movies Category:American sequel movies Category:1980s English-language movies Category:Movies set on fictional planets Category:Movies directed by James Cameron Category:Movies composed by James Horner Category:Feminist movies Category:Movies set in the future Category:Movies that won the Best Visual Effects Academy Award Category:Robot movies Category:Movies about children Category:American science fiction horror movies Category:Movies about extraterrestrial life",
