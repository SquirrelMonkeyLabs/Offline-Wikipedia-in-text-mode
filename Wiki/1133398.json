 "text": "Cranium is a board game. It was made by Cranium, Inc. before it was merged with Hasbro, Inc. The game is played in teams. The team that rolls the highest on a pair of dice goes first. There are four coloured category cards that match the spaces on the board. When the player lands on the space, they have to pick up the same coloured card and do what it says on the card before the time runs out. To win the game, the team has to get to the Cranium Central space in the middle of the board. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Board games",
