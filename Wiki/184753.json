 "text": "Aisha bint Abu Bakr (614–678; ) was the third wife of Muhammad. Aisha is given honour in Islam, especially in the Sunni branch. She is often called by Muslims Umm-al-mu'minin which means \"the Mother of the Believers\". Aisha was the daughter of Abu Bakr of Mecca. Her age is specified in the Sunni sahih hadiths she was 6 years old when Muhammad married her and 9 years old when he consumated the marriage with her. She was Muhammad's favorite wife even though he married seven more women after her. She was the only virgin that he ever married. She was also a scholar of Islamic jurisprudence and narrated the fourth most ahadeeth from him.\"Narrated Aisha: The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani- al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 5, Book 58, Hadith 234)\"Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).\" (Sahih al- Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Hadith 64)\"The Prophet wrote the [marriage contract] with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years [i.e. till his death].\" (Bukhari, vol. 7, book 67, no. 5134.)\"Aishah.\" Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.

She was married to Muhammad for 9 years, until his death in 632. Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. == Shia view == Unlike the Sunni branch of Islam, Shiites view Aisha as a evil woman due to her actions. They reject her title of \"the Mother of the Believers\" and send curses upon her due to her actions. Many Shiites also celebrate the death of Aisha by sending more curses upon her and celebrating with food. ==References== Category:614 births Category:678 deaths Category:Wives of Muhammad",
