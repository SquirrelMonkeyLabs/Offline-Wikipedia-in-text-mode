 "text": "A growth medium or culture medium is a solid or liquid containing nutrients. It is designed to support the growth of microorganisms or cells, or small plants like moss.Hadeler, Birgit; Scholz, Sirkka & Reski, Ralf 1995. Gelrite and agar differently influence cytokinin-sensitivity of a moss. Journal of Plant Physiology 146, 369â€“371. There are different types of media for growing different types of cells. There are a wide range of growth media used in biology. Some of the basic types are: #Undefined versus defined media: with defined media we know exactly what chemicals are in them. #Selective media: for example, a medium with an antibiotic added. The only things which grow are those resistant to the antibiotic. #Differential media: these distinguish one microorganism type from another growing on the same plate. #Transport media: these have just enough to let organisms survive. #Enriched media: contain extra amino acids and other building blocks. Used to harvest a wide range of organisms from a particular source. == References == Category:Microbiology Category:Laboratory equipment",
