 "text": "-hou is a suffix (part added to the end of a word) found in many Channel Islands and Norman names. It is the Norman language version of the Old Norse holmr, meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as \"holm\". It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages, e.g. Stockholm. The Norman hommet/houmet also comes from this suffix. In Parisian French, the equivalent is îlot, which is the same as the English \"islet\". == Bailiwick of Guernsey == * Off Guernsey ** Lihou ** Les Houmets including - Houmet Benest/Benet, Houmet Paradis & Houmet Hommetol (Omptolle). * Off Alderney ** Burhou * Off Herm ** Jethou ** Le Plat Houmet * Off Sark ** Brecqhou == Bailiwick of Jersey == * Les Écréhous * Le Plat Hommeit * Le Hommet du Ouaisné * Les Hommets * La Rocco (from rocque-hou) * Icho (from ic-hou) == Normandy == * Tatihou * Quettehou * Néhou * Tribehou == References == * * Category:Romance languages Category:Channel Islands",
