The movie is about two homosexual boys in Morocco. ==Controversies== In January 2025, before the movie was played at an international movie festival in Marrakech, Taïa explained that he was lonely and and that he didn't get the love he wanted during his childhood because he's gay. This missing love inspired him to make this movie. This speech resulted in hate comments on social media as the movie and his speech are said to be “inconsistent with the Islamic norms and values in Morrocco”. It even led to parliamentary questions in the Parliament of Morocco. ==Referrnces== ==Other websites== * Category:2024 drama movies Category:Moroccan movies Category:French movies Category:Movies set in Morocco Category:LGBT movies",
