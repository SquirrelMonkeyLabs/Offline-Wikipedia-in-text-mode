 "text": "Keira's shrub frog (Roarchestes keirasabinae) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in many parts of the Western Ghat mountains 100 to 1,000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests, high in where the branches come together like a roof. It has been seen in a few forests that were cut down and are growing back. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog like other frogs in Raorchestes. Scientists think this frog is at some risk of dying out because, even though it lives in a large place, that place is broken up into smaller places and the frogs cannot move between them easily. This frog lives in forests, and people have built farms in between. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
