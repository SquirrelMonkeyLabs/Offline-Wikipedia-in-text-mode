He was a most sagacious king, and built temples at Avantipur under his name. His Minister, Suyya, was a renowned genius. His court had a pride on two poets-Ranakar and Ananvardhana. During his time price of paddy showed a deep decline from 36 to 20 dinars. Suyya who was a great engineer is said to have drained a large chunck of wasteland during his regime. His memory is commemorated by Suyyapur or Sopore, a township in Baramulla district. It is said that when this great engineer was working in Sopore no people were coming forth to plunge themselves in gushing water. The king thereupon ordered that a part of treasury may be thrown into the water, a large number of people plunged into the river to get as many coins as they could. The skill of Suyya worked and the river was cleared of silt. Sopore town in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir was founded by the famous Utpala engineer and irrigation minister Suyya during the peaceful reign of king Avantivarman in 880 CE. ==Reign== Avantivarman was the grandson of Utpala, one of the five brothers who had taken control of the Karkota throne. Raised by Utpala's minister Sura, Anantivarman ascended the throne of Kashmir on 855 CE, establishing the Utpala dynasty and ending the rule of the Karkotas. Avantivarman appointed Suyya, an engineer and architect as his prime minister. The country had been badly affected due to the numerous civil wars over the last forty years and Avantivarman's reign restored the economy. Suyya carried out desilting of the Jhelum river and diverted its course. ==Arts and architecture== Avantivarman was a patron of the arts and the most notable scholar of his time was Anandhavardana, the author of the Dhvanyaloka.
