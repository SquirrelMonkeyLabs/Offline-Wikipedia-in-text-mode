 "text": "Benjamin Daniel Breedlove (August 8, 1993 â€“ December 25, 2011) was an American Internet personality. He was from Austin, Texas. He was known for his blogs on YouTube. At an early age, Breedlove had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). It is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Often, only one part of the heart is thicker than the other parts. The thickening can make it harder for blood to leave the heart, forcing the heart to work harder to pump blood. It also can make it harder for the heart to relax and fill with blood. On the night of December 25, 2011, he died of cardiac arrest at the age of 18. ==References== ==Other websites== * Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association * Ben Breedlove Memorial Service Video * Category:1993 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Deaths from cardiac arrest Category:Deaths from cardiomyopathy Category:American YouTubers Category:People from Austin, Texas",
