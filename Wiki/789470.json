The game's story is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from a mysterious supernatural force called \"Honkai\" (in Chinese it translates as \"Chaos\", while in Japanese, it is spelled as \"Houkai\"). It is the third entry in the Honkai series and spiritual successor to Honkai Gakuen, using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. Along with the mobile game himself, the storyline of Honkai Impact 3rd spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series, multiple manhua series, and promotional videos. == References == Category:2016 video games Category:Action role- playing video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Apocalyptic video games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:Gacha games Category:Hack and slash games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Mobile games Category:Open-world video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in China Category:Windows games",
