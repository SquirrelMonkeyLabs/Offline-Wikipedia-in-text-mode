 "text": "A taxicab stand (also called taxi rank, cab stand, taxi stand, cab rank, or hack stand) is a queue area on a street or on private property where taxicabs line up to wait for passengers. ==How stands work== Taxi stands can be at airports, hotels, railway stations, subway stations, bus depots, ferry terminals and shopping centres. Some stands are marked by painted signs. Taxi stands work as a first-come, first-served queue, so that the first taxicab to arrive on the stand (the one at the front of the line) serves the first passenger to arrive, and as the first taxicab leaves, each taxicab behind it moves ahead one spot, with the last taxicab to arrive taking the last spot. ==Other websites== * Category:Public transport Category:Street furniture",
