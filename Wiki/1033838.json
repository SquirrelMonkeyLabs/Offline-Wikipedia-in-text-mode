 "text": "Helen's flying tree frog (Rhacophorus helenae) is a frog. Scientists have seen it in Vietnam. The adult male frog is 72.3 - 85.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 89.4 - 90.7 mm long. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Adult frogs have more webbed skin on their feet than young frogs do. In adult frogs, the skin of the frog's back is green in color. Some frogs have white spots. The belly is white. There is black color on the sides of the body. There is some blue-green color and some yellow color on the legs. Some times the adult female frog will have light green color on her webbed skin. The adult male frog has yellow color in the same place. In young frogs, the skin of the frog's back is blue- gray in color with darker marks and the belly is bright yellow. The frogs make nests out of foam and put eggs in the nest. They make the nest on large leaves over water. There are 200-230 eggs in each nest. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. The tadpoles can be yellow or brown in color. This frog is in danger of dying out. It lives in four places in Vietnam: Nui Ong Nature Reserve, Tan Phu Forest, Binh Chauâ€“Phuoc Buu Nature Reserve, and Ma Da Forest. This is mostly because human beings change the places where it lives into farms and other things. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
