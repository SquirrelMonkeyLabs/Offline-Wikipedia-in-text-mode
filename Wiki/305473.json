 "text": "Salzburger Nockerl is a sweet dessert from Salzburg, Austria. The dessert is made of egg yolk, flour, sugar, salt, vanilla, and milk mixed into a thin dough. It is always freshly prepared. It is served warm with powdered sugar on it. The powdered sugar is said to represent the snow-covered peaks of the Gaisberg, Moenchsberg and Nonnberg. In the operetta \"Saison in Salzburg\" (Season in Salzburg) by Fred Raymond, the dessert is praised in a song as \"“Suess wie die Liebe und zart wie ein Kuss” (meaning Sweet as love and tender as a kiss in German). A legend says that they were invented by Salome Alt, the concubine of Salzburg′s Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau in the early 17th century. ==Other websites== *Spiegel Online:Nichts als heiße Luft (Nothing but hot air) Category:Austrian food Category:Desserts Category:Egg dishes",
