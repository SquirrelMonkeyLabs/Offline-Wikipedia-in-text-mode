 "text": "Woodlands North MRT station (TE1) is a underground Mass Rapid Transit terminal station in Woodlands, Singapore. It is located near Republic Polytechnic. The station is the northern terminal of the Thomson–East Coast line (TEL). A planned Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) at this station was delayed on 21 May 2019. This is due to Malaysia's financial situation. On 31 October 2019, Malaysia agreed to resume the RTS project at a lower cost although the project is still suspended until 30 April 2020. ==History== This station was first announced on 29 August 2012 by then Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew. Contract T202 which involves the construction of this station was awarded to Penta-Ocean Construction Co Ltd on 29 November 2013. The cost is S$337 million. Construction of the station began in early 2014. The station was planned to be open by the end of 2019 as part of the first stage of the TEL. However the station's opening was later changed to 31 January 2020. ==References== ==Related pages== *Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations Category:Woodlands, Singapore",
