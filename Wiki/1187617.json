 "text": "The Scotland Act 2016 is a UK law that gave more powers to Scotland. It changed the older Scotland Act of 1998. This happened after a report on how to give Scotland more control, following a 2014 independence referendum where Scotland decided to stay in the UK. The law lets Scotland make more decisions about things like how its own elections work, road rules, energy, abortion, welfare, trains, and taxes. It also says that the Scottish Parliament and Government are now a permanent part of the UK and can only be ended if the people of Scotland vote for it. == References == Category:Politics of Scotland Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom Category:Scottish devolution",
