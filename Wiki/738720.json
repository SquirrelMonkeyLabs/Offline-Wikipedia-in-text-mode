He was a member of the People's Party. Klestil was born in Vienna. He got divorced from his first wife Edith Wielander in 1998. That same year, Klestil married diplomat Margot Löffler. On 5 July 2004, three days before he was to leave office, Klestil had either a heart attack or heart failure. It may have been caused by his long-term lung problems. He was left in critical condition at a Viennese hospital. On 6 July, he died of multiple organ failure. He was 71. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Deaths from multiple organ failure Category:Disease-related deaths in Austria Category:Politicians from Vienna Category:Presidents of Austria",
