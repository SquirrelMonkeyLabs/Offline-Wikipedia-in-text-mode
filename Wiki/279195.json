It was first made as a station wagon, and was later made as an SUV. Up until the eleventh generation, the Chevrolet Suburban was based on the Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck. For a number of years, the Suburban was the largest SUV made in America. There was also a GMC Suburban, although GMC's version was later rebranded the GMC Yukon XL in 2000. From 1998 to 2001 a right-hand drive version was made in Mexico and sold in Australia and New Zealand by Holden using the Suburban name, but was not a best seller and was withdrawn afterwards. Since its inception, there has been twelve generations of Suburbans, the latest introduced in December 2020 and went on sale in May 2020 as a 2021 model. Suburban",
