Along with Dharwad, it forms the Hubli-Dharwad twin cities, creating Karnataka’s second-largest urban cluster after Bengaluru. == Etymology == The name \"Hubballi\" comes from Kannada, meaning \"Flowering Creeper.\" Over centuries, what was once called \"Hoovina Balli\" evolved into today’s Hubballi — a city that has truly blossomed in every way. == History == Hubli’s story is as colorful as its name. It was once a thriving trading center under the Vijayanagara Empire, famous for cotton and iron. Later, it saw the rise and fall of rulers from the Adil Shahi dynasty, the Marathas, and finally the British. The city also carved a place for itself in India’s freedom movement, inspiring generations with its spirit of resistance. == Geography and Climate == Located about 670 meters (2,200 feet) above sea level, Hubli enjoys a mix of warm summers, cool winters, and a refreshing monsoon season. Its pleasant weather and greenery make it a lively yet comfortable place to live and visit. == Economy == Today, Hubli is often called the \"Chota Mumbai\" (Little Mumbai) of Karnataka — a reflection of its growing industrial and commercial importance. Major industries shaping the city include: * Textile manufacturing * Foundry and machine tools * Information technology services * Agricultural markets — Hubli hosts one of India's largest APMC markets It’s also the headquarters of the South Western Railway, making it a vital transport and business hub. == Transportation == Hubli keeps you connected with the world: * By Train: Hubli Junction is among Karnataka’s busiest railway stations. * By Road: Sitting at the crossroads of major national highways, it’s a crucial stop for travelers across India. * By Air: Hubli Airport offers daily flights to Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and more — and is quickly expanding. == Education == Hubli has long been a center for learning and innovation.
