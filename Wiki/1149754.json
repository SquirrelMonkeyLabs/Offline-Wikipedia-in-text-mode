 "text": "The Renault FT is a French light tank. It was designed and produced during World War I and was noted for its innovative design and its influence on the development of future tanks. It was produced in large quantities, with more than 3,800 units built. Its production began in 1917 and continued until 1919. It was used by the French army in World War I and other armies in later conflicts. The FT introduced the concept of a tank with a turret, allowing for greater mobility and flexibility in combat. It had a rear-engine layout, providing more space in the hull for crew and weapons. It was a role model for many armies and is considered one of the predecessors of modern tanks. This tank had a lasting impact on future tank design, with its central turret configuration and focus on mobility. The FT had a light weight of around 6.5 tons. It was powered by a 4-cylinder gasoline engine that gave it a maximum speed of approximately 7 km/h. It had a crew of two people: the driver and gunner. Depending on the version, the FT 17 was armed with a 8 mm Hotchkiss machine gun or a 37 mm Puteaux SA 18 cannon. Its armor was 8 to 22 mm. Category:Tanks",
