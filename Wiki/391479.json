An example of a classification based on age is young-adult fiction, which is written for children between the ages of 12 and 18. A literary genre is the style of the book. It also refers to the technique, tone, content, or length. * Picture books, including books that teach the alphabet or counting for example. They either have very few words or none at all. * Traditional literature, including folktales, which convey the legends, customs, superstitions, and beliefs of people in previous civilizations. This genre can be further broken into subgenres: myths, fables, legends, and fairy tales * Fiction, including fantasy, realistic fiction, and historical fiction * Non-fiction * Biography and autobiography * Poetry Many children's books are meant to teach children the consequences of engaging in \"bad\" behaviour, such as running away, stealing and lying. Tom Sawyer and Toby Tyler are two notable examples of the genre. Britsh Awards There are a few children's literature awards in Britain. These include, Waterstones Award and the Caldecott Award.
