 "text": "Whitewashing, in movies, is when a white actor plays a character who isn't white, when a character's race is changed to white from something else, or when someone changes a story so that people who are not white seem less important. *In the 2013 movie The Lone Ranger, white actor Johnny Depp played an American Indian character. *In the 2016 movie Doctor Strange, the character \"The Ancient One\" was changed from Asian to white so Tilda Swinton could play her. *Many 20th century movies about cowboys show only white men. In real life, many cowboys were black or Latino. ==References== Category:Movies Category:Racism",
