 "text": "MCST () is a microprocessor company that was set up in the 1992s. Different types of processors made by MCST were used in personal computers, servers and computing systems. MCST develops microprocessors based on 2 different instruction set architecture (ISA): Elbrus and SPARC * Elbrus 1 (1973) was the fourth generation Soviet computer, developed by Vsevolod Burtsev. Implements tag-based architecture and ALGOL as system language like the Burroughs large systems. A side development was an update of the 1965 BESM-6 as Elbrus-1K2. * Elbrus 2 (1977) was a 10-processor computer, considered the first Soviet supercomputer, with superscalar RISC processors. Re-implementation of the Elbrus 1 architecture with faster ECL chips. * Elbrus 3 (1986) was a 16-processor computer developed by Boris Babaian. Differing completely from the architecture of both Elbrus 1 and Elbrus 2, it employed a VLIW architecture. * Elbrus-90micro (1998-2010) is a computer line based on SPARC instruction set architecture (ISA) microprocessors: MCST R80, R150, R500, R500S and MCST-4R working at 80, 150, 500 and 1000 MHz. * Elbrus-3M1 (2005) is a 2-processor computer based on Elbrus 2000 microprocessor employing VLIW architecture working at 300 MHz. It is a further development of the Elbrus 3 (1986). * Elbrus МВ3S1/C (2009) is a ccNUMA 4-processor computer based on Elbrus-S microprocessor working at 500 MHz. ==Other websites== * Elbrus website in Russian * Elbrus E2K * \"Elbrus\" processor info (russian) * \"Elbrus-S\" processor info (russian) * МВ3S1/C \"Elbrus-S\" based processor module(russian) * \"Elbrus-3M1\" computer info (russian) * (I) Power Point document \"Elbrus-3M1\" * (II) Power Point document \"Elbrus-3M1\" * Russian microprocessors: An overview (Spanish - Espacial.org) * Video of booting Windows 2000 on Elbrus microprocessor Category:Companies based in Moscow Category:Technology companies of Russia",
