 "text": "A synthetic element is an element of the Periodic Table that has been created in a lab. Most are man made and radioactive. Scientists make synthetic elements by smashing and fusing 2 different sized elements together to makes a whole new one. They usually fall apart in seconds, though, if not minutes. Examples of these are some Uranium atoms, Technetium atoms, and most of the Actinide elements.",
