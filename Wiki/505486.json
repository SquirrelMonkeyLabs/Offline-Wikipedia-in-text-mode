 "text": "The black-headed parrot is Pionites melanocephalus. It lives in forests, most often in humid places, and nearby wooded habitats. They are known as 'caiques'. The bird is widespread in South America, and has two subspecies which are very similar. It lives north of the Amazon River and west of the Ucayali River in Brazil, northern Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It is quite common and lives in many protected areas. They are usually in pairs or small noisy groups of 10 to 30. They eat flowers, fruit, and seeds and possibly insects. Males and females look the same: they have identical plumage. == References == Category:True parrots Category:Birds of South America",
