 "text": "Vark is a super fine filigree foil sheet of pure metals. It is usually made of silver but sometimes gold. It is used to decorate South Asian sweets and food. It is also placed on saffroned rice to make it look more appetising. The silver and gold are edible and flavorless. Varak is made by pounding silver into sheets a few micrometres (Î¼m) thick. It breaks easily into smaller pieces if touched. Vark sheets are laid or rolled over some South Asian sweets, confectionery, dry fruits and spices. ==References== Category:Indian food Category:Desserts",
