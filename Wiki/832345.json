If you want the best of the best, look to the Galaxy S21 Ultra; but if you want a handset that’s cheaper than the Galaxy S20 was at launch, with a whole load of premium features, the Galaxy S21 is a delight to use, and will do you proud.\" == References == Category:Mobile phones with multiple rear cameras Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording Category:Samsung Galaxy Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2021",
