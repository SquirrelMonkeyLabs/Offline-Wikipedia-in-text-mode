 "text": "Dracovenator was a meat-eating dinosaur that lived in southern Africa during the Early Jurassic period. That was about 185 million years ago. It is a relative of Dilophosaurus. It might have had a pair of crests, just like Sinosaurus and various other species. Its name means \"Dragon hunter\". It was given this name because dinosaurs are similar to the dragons of mythology, and it was a carnivore, so this species were probably a hunter of both small and large animals. Dracovenator was a large carnivorous dinosaur, about 23 feet long. It is the first large meat-eating dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of Africa to be discovered. Dracovenator was described first as an African species and named in 2006, based on a hand claw, an upper jaw with teeth, back bones, hip bones, ribs, and foot bones. There is one genus of this dinosaur, Dracovenator regenti. This species was discovered in the Elliot Formation in South Africa.
