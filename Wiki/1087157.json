 "text": "The Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893, known in Thailand as the Incident of Rattanakosin Era 112 was a conflict between the French Third Republic and the Kingdom of Siam. Auguste Pavie, French vice consul in Luang Prabang in 1886, was the chief agent in furthering French interests in Laos. His intrigues, which took advantage of Siamese weakness in the region and periodic invasions by Vietnamese rebels from Tonkin, increased tensions between Bangkok and Paris. The conflict concluded with the Paknam Incident, in which French gunboats sailed up the Chao Phraya River to blockade Bangkok. The Siamese subsequently agreed to give the area that constitutes most of present-day Laos to France, an act that led to the significant expansion of French Indochina. This came after the Haw wars (1865â€“1890), in which the Siamese attempted to pacify northern Siam and Tonkin. ==References== Category:1893 Category:History of Thailand Category:History of Laos Category:Battles involving France",
