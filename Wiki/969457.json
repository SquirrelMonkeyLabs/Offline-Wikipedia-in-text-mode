 "text": "Charles Alan Murray (; born January 8, 1943) is an American political scientist. He is the W.H. Brady Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, DC. Many people do not agree with Murray's work. His book Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950â€“1980 (1984) talks about the American welfare system. In the book The Bell Curve (1994), he and co-author Richard Herrnstein say that in 20th century American society, intelligence is more likely to predict the outcome of an issues than parental socioeconomic status or education level. These issues include income, job performance, pregnancy out of wedlock, and crime. They say that that social welfare programs and education efforts to improve social outcomes for the disadvantaged are not useful. The Bell Curve also claims that average intelligence quotient (IQ) differences between racial and ethnic groups are partly genetic in origin. This view is now considered to be not true by mainstream science. ==References== Category:1943 births category:Living people Category:Libertarians Category:American political scientists Category:Writers from Iowa",
