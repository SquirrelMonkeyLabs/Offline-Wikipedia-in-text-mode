 "text": "Defend Your Castle is a series of video games made by XGen Studios. In the games, players have to kill enemies heading towards the player's castle before it is destroyed. There are different ways that the player can do so, such as by picking up enemies or by attacking them with weapons. Weapons can be bought with points that the player gets in levels. Players can also use points to repair their castle or put walls around it. The game was originally a Macromedia Flash-based browser game. Versions of the game were later released for the WiiWare service on Nintendo's Wii console and for iOS. ==References== ==Other websites== * Defend Your Castle - Link to flash game.
