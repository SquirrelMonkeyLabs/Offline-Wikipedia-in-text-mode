 "text": "In math, the identity property is made up of two parts: the additive identity property and the multiplicative identity property. The additive identity property says that the sum of adding any number and zero (0) is just the original number. For that reason, zero is often called the identity property identity of common numbers. The multiplicative identity property says that the product of multiplying any number and one (1) is just the original number. Also, if you divide a number by itself, the result (quotient) is one. For that reason, one is often called the multiplicative identity of common numbers. == Related pages == * Identity (mathematics) == References == Category:Algebra",
