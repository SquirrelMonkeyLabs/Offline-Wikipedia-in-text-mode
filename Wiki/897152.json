 "text": "The Renault 6 is a small family car produced by the French automaker Renault between 1968 and 1986. The Renault 6 (R6) was launched at the 1968 Paris Motor Show, and was intended to be an upmarket alternative to the Renault 4. It used a similar dashboard-mounted gear-lever and over-the-engine linkage to that used in the Renault 4 and the small CitroÃ«ns with which it competed. The R6 used the R4 platform as well as its 845 cc (51.6 cu in) engine and was technically near-identical, but its hatchback body was larger and more modern. Visually it resembled the larger Renault 16. French R6 production commenced in October 1968 and lasted until 1980, but continued elsewhere until 1986.
