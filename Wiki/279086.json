 "text": "The Avoca River drains a large area of western and central Victoria, Australia. It is 270 kilometres from its beginnings near Amphitheatre to Lake Bael Bael. It flows through several towns including Avoca, Bealiba, Charlton and Culgoa. It is not a deep river, most of it is less than 2m, but there are some deeper pools near Logan. There are 13 creeks which flow into the Avoca River. The river carries varying amounts of water, and in summer can stop flowing for several months. At other times it can flood. In January 2010 the river flooded and covered about 80% of the town of Charlton. The roads into the town were cut and emergency food supplies had to be brought in by helicopter. The town of Culgoa was also flooded. ==References== Category:Rivers of Victoria (Australia)",
