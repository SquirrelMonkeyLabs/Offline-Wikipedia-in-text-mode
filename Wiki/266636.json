 "text": "Uthman ibn Affan () was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and third caliph in the succession of early leaders, who reigned from 644 to 656. Uthman belonged to a noble family of the Umayyads, branch of the Quraish in Makkah. Uthman was one of the very few who was literate. When he became older, he started a business in cloth, which made him very rich.Tadhkirah al-Huffath, al-Dhahabi, Muhammad ibn Ahmad. 1: 8-10. Hyderabad, Da'irah al-Ma`arif al- Uthmaniyyah. ==Biography== He was born in about the year 576 and was ruler for 12 years. During his time as ruler he conquered Khurasan and the regions of the west of the Arabian Peninsula. He also united the Muslims on one uniform version of the Quran. He was well known for marrying two of Muhammad's daughters, Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum, both at different times. For this, he became known as Dhu al-Nurayn, the \"Possessor of Two Lights\". He participated in both immigrations, first to Ethiopia and then to Medina. ==Death== He was attacked while in his house, although he did not defend himself out of fear of further trouble. He was killed while reading the Qur'an by Sudaan ibn Hamran on Friday, June 17, 656. He died aged 79-80 years. Originating in the aftermath of Uthman's assassination in 656, the political Uthmaniyya (Arabic: عُثْمَانيَّة), or (party of Uthman) as they were called, asserted that Uthman's successor Ali () was an illegitimate caliph, as he was involved in the murder of Uthman and had not been elected by a (consultation), hence a new caliph had to be elected. ==References== Category:Sahaba Category:Caliphs Category:576 births Category:656 deaths",
