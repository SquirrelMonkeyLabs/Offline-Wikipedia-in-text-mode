 "text": "Sum 41 (sometimes called The Sums, originally called Kaspir) is a Canadian rock punk band from Ajax, Ontario. The people currently in the band are Deryck Whibley (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Cone McCaslin (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Steve Jocz (drums, percussion, and backing vocals). The band's most known lineup is the same, except with Dave Baksh on lead guitar and backing vocals. In 1999, the band signed a record deal with Island Records. Since then, the band has released four studio albums. Their most successful album to date is All Killer, No Filler. The album had the single \"Fat Lip\" which did very well, making it the band's most successful single. The second single off the album, \"In Too Deep\", also did well. They often perform more than 300 times in a single year. That is why they are known for their long and worldwide tours, most of which last more than a year. So far, all of the Sum 41 albums have done very well in Canada. Sum 41 has received many awards and nominations. They have been nominated for seven Juno Awards (the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy Award), winning twice. On March 30, 2025, Sum 41 will perform their last show at the 54th annual Juno Awards.
