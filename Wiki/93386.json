It nearly completely surrounds the city of Bonn. ==History== The district as known today was created in 1969, during the reorganization of the districts in North Rhine-Westphalia, by combining Sieg District with the Rural District of Bonn. == Coat of arms == The red lion is the symbol of the dukes of Berg, who owned a large part of the district. The black cross in the shield is the symbol of Cologne, because another part of the district was owned by the bishops of Cologne. The yellow sword is the symbol of Saint Michael, the patron of the mighty Michaelsberg Abbey in Siegburg. ==Towns and municipalities== Towns Municipalities # Bad Honnef # Bornheim # Hennef (Sieg) # KÃ¶nigswinter # Lohmar # Meckenheim # Niederkassel # Rheinbach # Sankt Augustin # Siegburg # Troisdorf # Alfter # Eitorf # Much # Neunkirchen- Seelscheid # Ruppichteroth # Swisttal # Wachtberg # Windeck ==References== == Other websites== * Official Website (German, English, French)",
