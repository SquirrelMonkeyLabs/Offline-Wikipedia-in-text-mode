Lenno is on a small bay of Lake Como called the Golfo di Venere (Bay of Venus). Ancient Romans started the village. Julius Ceasar invited 500 Greeks to come live in the village. The Greeks planted olive trees all around Lenno. The historian Paolo Giovio (1483-1552) and the geographer Abraham Ortelius (1527â€“1598) wrote that Pliny the Younger had a villa in Lenno. It was called the Comedy villa.Bagot, Richard (1912). The Italian Lakes, pp. 107-108. A. & C. Black Today, the village is popular with tourists.
