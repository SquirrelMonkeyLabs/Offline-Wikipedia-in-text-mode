 "text": "The Germanic languages are a group of Indo-European languages. They came from one language, Proto-Germanic, which was first spoken in Scandinavia in the Iron Age. Today, the Germanic languages are spoken by around 515 million people as a first language. English is the most spoken Germanic language, with 360-400 million native speakers. The Germanic languages are the East Germanic languages (all extinct), the North Germanic languages, and the West Germanic languages. When Proto-Germanic split from Proto-Indo-European, one of the main changes to the sounds in the language was Grimmâ€™s law. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Languages of Europe",
