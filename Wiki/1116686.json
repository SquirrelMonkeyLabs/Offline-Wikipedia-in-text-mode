 "text": "Altantuya Shaariibuu (6 May 1978 â€“ 18 October 2006) was a Mongolian national murdered in Shah Alam, Malaysia. Her case is significant due to the alleged involvement of people close to former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The Shah Alam High Court sentenced Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri and Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar to death on 9 April 2009. Abdul Razak Baginda was acquitted. On 23 August 2013, Sirul and Azilah were acquitted by the Court of Appeal, causing controversy. On 13 January 2015, the Federal Court found them guilty again and sentenced them to death. Sirul fled to Australia, and extradition efforts were blocked due to Australian laws against the death penalty. After the 14th general election, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Altantuya's father called for further investigation. Sirul offered to reveal the truth if pardoned. On 16 December 2019, Azilah Hadri, from death row, alleged that Najib and Abdul Razak Baginda ordered the murder. ==References== Category:Murder in the 2000s Category:Murder in Asia Category:2006 deaths Category:21st century in Malaysia",
