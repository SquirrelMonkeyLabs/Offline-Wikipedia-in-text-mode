 "text": "In organic chemistry, aliphatic compounds are hydrocarbons (often also structural analogs or derivatives of hydrocarbons) which are not aromatic compounds. All alkanes and all acyclic hydrocarbons are aliphatic. An unsaturated cyclic compound can be either aliphatic or aromatic depending on its exact structure. Compounds other than hydrocarbons may be called aliphatic if they contain aliphatic hydrocarbons; for example, an aliphatic amine is one where nitrogen is bonded only to aliphatic hydrocarbons or hydrogen. == References ==",
