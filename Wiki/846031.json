It was first published in March 1997 and has sold more than 1.2 million copies.” ==Death== On May 29, 2021, Gwen was killed in a plane crash in Smyrna, Tennessee alongside her husband, Joe Lara. ==Books== * * * * * * * * == References == ==Other websites== * * Remnant Fellowship Church Website link retrieved 11/01/2018 Category:1955 births Category:2021 deaths Category:American Christian writers Category:Aviation deaths in the United States Category:Writers from Memphis, Tennessee",
