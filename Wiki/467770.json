It has a golden eagle on top of the multi colored stripes. It has a ratio of 2:3. ===Symbolism=== The flag's colours and emblems all have a meaning. Each of the four colours represents an aspect of Zambia: green is for the natural resources and vegetation; red is for the struggle for freedom; black is for the people and orange is for rhe mineral wealth (primarily copper). The eagle is an African fish eagle, which also appears in the national coat of arms and represents the people's ability to rise above the country's problems. == References == Category:National symbols of Zambia Zambia",
