 "text": "The Jessi Slaughter cyberbullying case was a U.S. criminal case involving an 11-year-old girl named Jessica Leonhardt (known online as “Jessi Slaughter” and “Kerligirl13”), whose profanity-laden videos went viral on Instagram and YouTube in 2010. The videos were made in response to allegations that a friend had raped Leonhardt and that Leonhardt had had a sexual relationship with the lead singer of the electropop band Blood on the Dance Floor, with a man named Dahvie Vanity (real name Jesus David Torres) while they were minors. This led to a campaign of telephone and Internet harassment against Leonhardt and his family, mainly attributed to 4chan users and members of the Internet group Anonymous A discussion began on the dangers of anonymity on the Internet and whether or not the Internet is a safe environment for minors and all people in general. Leonhardt told The Independent in 2016, “I wouldn't even call what happened to me cyberbullying, it was straight up bullying and harassment. It started as cyberbullying but it evolved quickly.” Vanity has repeatedly denied all allegations against him. He has also denied knowing Leonhardt or any of the other victims who have accused him of sexual assault, rape and child molestation and has stated that Leonhardt was mentally ill. The song “You Done Goofed” from the band's Epic album is about Leonhardt and Vanity's alleged experiences with them. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:Living people Category:Child sexual abuse",
