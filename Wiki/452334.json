 "text": "Abraham de Moivre was a French mathematician. He is known for his works on probability theory. He also did a lot of research in trigonometry.De Moivre's formula connects complex numbers and trigonometry. As he was a Huguenot, he was forced to emigrate to England. He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmund Halley, and James Stirling. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux. De Moivre wrote a book on probability theory, The Doctrine of Chances, said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered Binet's formula, the closed- form expression for Fibonacci numbers linking the nth power of the golden ratio Ï† to the nth Fibonacci number.
