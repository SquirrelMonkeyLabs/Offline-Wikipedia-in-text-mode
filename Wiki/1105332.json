 "text": "Classical Arabic or Quranic Arabic is the form of the Arabic language used in the Quran, the Islamic holy book, as well as in poetry and other early Arabic literature. It is considered the purest form of the language and is the foundation for modern standard Arabic. == Features == Here are some important characteristics of Classical Arabic: * Quranic Language: The Quran, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century CE, is written in Classical Arabic. As such, Classical Arabic serves as the language of religious scripture for Muslims around the world. * Literary Tradition: Classical Arabic was used in pre-Islamic poetry, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula. Many famous poets, such as Imru' al-Qais and Antara ibn Shaddad, composed their works in this form of Arabic. * Conservatism: Classical Arabic is characterized by its conservatism and adherence to strict grammatical rules and structures. It has preserved many linguistic features from its earliest stages and has changed relatively little over the centuries. * High Prestige: Due to its association with the Quran and classical literature, Classical Arabic holds a high prestige in the Arabic-speaking world. It is often used in formal or religious contexts and is considered the standard for eloquence and purity in the language. * Influence on Modern Standard Arabic: Modern Standard Arabic, the standardized form of Arabic used in media, literature, and formal communication across the Arab world, is heavily influenced by Classical Arabic. Many vocabulary, grammar rules, and linguistic conventions in Modern Standard Arabic are derived from Classical Arabic. Overall, Classical Arabic is not only a linguistic form but also a cultural and religious heritage, deeply intertwined with the history and identity of Arabic-speaking peoples and the Islamic faith.
