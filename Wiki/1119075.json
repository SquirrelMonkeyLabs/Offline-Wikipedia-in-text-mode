 "text": "From May 2 to September 27, 2023, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), with 11,500 screenwriters, went on strike. The strike was over a labor argument with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). Over 148 days, the strike is similar to the 1960 strike. It is the second-longest strike that the WGA has ever done. The only longer strike was its 1988 strike (153 days). This went alongside the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. This strike went until November. It was part of a larger part of Hollywood labor disputes. Both strikes interrupted American movie and television. Because of the strike, many studios had to close of reduce staff. The strike also hurt long-term contracts made during the media streaming boom. Big studios could end deals with writers through force majeure. This saved many studios millions of dollars. Many other areas of entertainment in the world were hurt by the strike. VFX and prop- making were both hurt by the strike. After making an agreement, the union ended the strike on September 27, 2023. On October 9, the WGA created the contract. 99% of WGA members voted for the contract. This trike, along with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike resulted in 45,000 jobs being lost. The economy of Southern California also lost 6.5 billion dollars. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Media coverage from * Media coverage from ; * Media coverage from * * Category:Burbank, California Category:June 2023 events Category:July 2023 events Category:May 2023 events Category:August 2023 events Category:2023 in the United States Category:Controversies in the United States Category:2023 in American television Category:OpenAI",
