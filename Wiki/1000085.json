He was one of the most notable engineers of the 18th century. In 1750 he rented a millwright's shop in Burslem from the Wedgwoods who became his lifelong friends. He built several flint mills for the pottery trade. He was involved in the building of the Bridgewater Canal and the Trent & Mersey Canal. In total Brindley built 365 miles (587 km) of canals and many watermills, including the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the Coventry Canal, the Oxford Canal and numerous others, and he also constructed the watermill at Leek, which is now the Brindley Water Museum. == References == Category:Canals in England Category:British civil engineers Category:1716 births Category:1772 deaths",
