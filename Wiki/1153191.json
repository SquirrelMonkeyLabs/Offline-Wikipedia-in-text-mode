 "text": "Monsters Resurrected is an American entertain series that was created for the Discovery Channel. This program reconstructs animals from the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras. It's also called as Mega Beasts. == Plot == === Terror Bird === The famous terror bird Titanis was depicted as a mortal predator that competed with the smaller but equally aggressive Edward's wolf and Smilodon. The force and power of the neck muscles is shown by a rendering of the beast hunting a Hipparion in the beginning of the episode. To kill it, it drives its beak into the vertebral column, severing the spinal cord. Another example of this power is shown when the creature kills a species of ground sloth called Glossotherium, using the same method. === T-Rex of the Deep === In this episode, the Tylosaurus is depicted as the main predator of the Cretaceous seas, competing with Cretoxyrhina and Styxosaurus, eventually driving the former to extinction. It's also shown competing with other Tylosaurus and killing them. === Biggest Killer Dino === Spinosaurus is depicted as the apex predator of its time, slaughtering Rugops, Carcharodontosaurus and Sarcosuchus. It fights with a sexless Carcharodontosaurus and emerges victorious by smacking its face with a swipe of its claw. The beast gets attacked by a Sarcosuchus, and quickly kills the crocodile with a bite to the neck before disemboweling her. During the heat, the theropod attempts to steal a dead Aegyptosaurus from a pack of female Rugops, but their numbers are unstoppable; one of the creatures bites the spinosaur's claw, while another one clamps her jaws on its massive tail. Afterwards, the Spinosaurus slams to the ground, breaking its neutral spine and dying. The pack feasts on it. === Great American Predator === In this episode, the Acrocanthosaurus is depicted as an apex predator, strong enough to kill prey ten times its size, such as the herbivorous dinosaur Paluxysaurus. Afterward, a young Acrocanthosaurus is shown being driven off its meal by a pack of Deinonychus and being forced to hunt harder prey, such as the ankylosaurid Sauropelta. === Bear Dog === This episode features the bear-dog Amphicyon as the new top predator of North America, able to defeat the entelodont Daeodon using its intelligence and smaller size to outcompete it. After five years of dominating the landscape, the bear-dog grows bigger, but then its nemesis Epicyon appears and competes with it. They begin to attack and slaughter the offspring in the burrow, and in the end, the canids outcompete and kill the new threats. === Giant Ripper === In this episode, the people recreate Megalania. Hunting Procoptodon and Diprotodon, it almost had no competition, until the humans arrived. == Inaccuracies about Bear Dog replacements == * A bear-dog called Cynodictis was meant to replace Amphicyon in the episode, but got cut in the process. * Archaeotherium was also going to replace Daeodon, resulting in it getting removed from the series. * Epicyon was going to be named as Hesperocyon or Borophagus during the production, but the two species got scrapped, with only Epicyon appearing.
