 "text": "British Member of Parliament for Batley and Spen Jo Cox was killed after being shot and stabbed many times on 16 June 2016. Thomas Alexander Mair, a 53-year- old gardener, was found guilty of the murder in September. He held far-right views and attacked her because she supported the European Union and immigration. He was sentenced to life imprisionment with a whole life order. This was the first time a sitting MP had been killed since 1990, when Ian Gow was killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. ==References== Category:June 2016 events Category:Terrorist incidents in 2016 Category:Murder in 2016 Category:2010s murders in the United Kingdom Category:Murders by firearm in England",
