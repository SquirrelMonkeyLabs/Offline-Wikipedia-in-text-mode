 "text": "Tea is a caffeinated drink made from steeping the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Tea can have other herbs, spices, or fruit flavors in it, like lemon. ==Overview== Sometimes, tea is used for other drinks that have been made by soaking fruit or herbs in hot water, like \"rosehip tea\" or \"chamomile tea\". These are called \"herbal teas\". After water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. ==Types== There are three main types of tea: black tea, oolong, and green tea. ===Black tea=== To make black tea, leaves are dried with hot air until they turn brown or black. Next, they are broken into pieces and put into a room where they absorb oxygen, or oxidize. Chemical reactions change the taste and style of the tea. Most black tea comes from Sri Lanka, Indonesia and eastern Africa. Another name used for black tea, especially in China, is red tea. That is because when black tea leaves are brewed in boiling water, the tea made from them looks deep dark red. ===Oolong tea=== Oolong tea is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea. It is produced by withering the leaves under strong sun. ===Green tea=== Green tea is made by steaming freshly picked leaves. This keeps them green. Then they are crushed and dried in ovens. India is the biggest maker and user of green tea.
