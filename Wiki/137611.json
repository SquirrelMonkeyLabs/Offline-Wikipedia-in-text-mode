 "text": "Artificial life (commonly Alife or alife) is a field of study that looks at systems related to life, its processes, and its evolution. This is done with simulations using computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. There are three main kinds of alife, named for their approaches: soft, (from software); hard, (from hardware); and wet (from biochemistry). Artificial life simulates traditional biology by trying to recreate biological phenomena. It is common for \"artificial life\" to refer to soft alife in specific.John Johnston, (2008) \"The Allure of Machinic Life: Cybernetics, Artificial Life, and the New AI\", MIT Press ==References== Category:Scientific modeling",
