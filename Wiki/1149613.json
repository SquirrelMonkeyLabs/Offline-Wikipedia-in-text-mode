His parents died of cancer before Lutnick started college. The president and dean of Haverford called Lutnick a week after his father's death and offered him a full scholarship for his education there. Lutnick graduated from the school with a degree in economics in 1983. ==Business career== Lutnick joined Cantor Fitzgerald in 1983. In 1991, Lutnick was named president and CEO of the company, and he became chairman in 1996. In 2004, Lutnick and then head of the London office Lee M. Amaitis decided to split Cantor Fitzgerald into two separate operations. Cantor would become head of the newly formed BGC Partners. In 2008, Lutnick helped merge BGC Partners and eSpeed, a deal worth $1.3 billion. ===September 11 attacks=== At the time of the September 11 attacks, Cantor Fitzgerald's offices was located in the 101–105th floors in the World Trade Center's North Tower, just above where a hijacked plane hit the building. None of the employees who were in the Cantor offices that morning survived the attacks. In total, 658 of Cantor's 960 employees died that day, including Lutnick's brother, Gary Lutnick. Lutnick himself would have been in the office that morning, but on September 11 he was taking his son Kyle to his first day of kindergarten. He survived the collapse of South Tower by taking cover under a car nearby. After the attacks, Lutnick made several public appearances, and quickly became a well known survivor of the September 11 attacks. Four days after the attacks, on September 15, Lutnick announced that he would stop the paychecks of nearly 700 employees who were missing or had died. In 2006, the firm donated $180 million to the relatives of their employees affected by the 9/11 attack. ===Philanthropy=== Just days after the September 11 attacks, Lutnick created the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund as a non-profit organization to help the families of Cantor employees who died in the attacks of September 11. The fund was started with a $1 million donation from Lutnick himself. Lutnick's sister Edie Lutnick, a former labor lawyer, agreed to join the charity as executive director and co-founder. The fund has given out $180 million to families of Cantor employees and $280 million altogether as the fund has donated to efforts to help victims of natural disasters.Goldberg, Eleanor (January 15, 2013). \"Cantor Fitzgerald Slacks on 9/11 Pledge, But Promises $10 Million to Sandy Relief\".
