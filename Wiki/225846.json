 "text": "The Zebra Turkeyfish (Dendrochirus zebra) is a very venomous fish. It lives in the Indian and Pacific seas. The fish has 13 venomous spines along its back, used to look after itself. The fish is slow and quiet but can be a danger. The fish rests in dark places such as under a rock or a piece of coral. They aren't affected by each other's venom. They are solitary fish that are not scared of anything, as they have no predators other than groupers. == Other websites == Category:Scorpaeniformes",
