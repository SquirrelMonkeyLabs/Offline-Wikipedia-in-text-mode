He became the emperor of the Mughal Empire; his power was so depleted during his reign that it led to a saying in the Persian language, Sultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam, meaning, 'The kingdom of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam', Palam being a suburb of Delhi. == References == ==Other websites== Category:1728 births Category:1806 deaths Category:Mughal emperors Category:18th century in India Category:19th century in India",
