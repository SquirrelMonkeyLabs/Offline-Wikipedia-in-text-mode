I Our tongue a noble gem bejeweled From ominous shadows of old, A pendant of stones rare and grand That scattered all over our land. II Our language is a fervent flare Amidst a folk who suddenly Awoke from the deadly slumber Like the heroes brave and holy. III Our language a body of songs From the devotions of our soul. A flash of lightning strikes apace Within black clouds, blue horizons. IV Our language is the tongue of bread When the breeze blows through the summer Proclaimed by our forefathers who Blessed the country through their labour. V Our tongue the greenest verdant frond Of our codrii lasting and fond, Our Dniester flows with repose Like a constellation of stars. VI Bemoan not! Thy yammers shall cease That thy tongue's only a mere piece; Yet, abound in words aplenty That scatter o'er our dear country. VII Our language abounds in folklore And legends from the days of yore. Reading and delving into them Renders all aghast and in qualm. VIII Our language is the chosen one For blessing glory in heaven, Acclaiming in endless passion Everlasting faiths that beckon. IX More than heavenly is our tongue Of sacred homilies of old; For aeons lamented and sung All over the motherland heard. X Our language shall one again rise After the passing grieving years, Wash off the rust and grime that grew When left in oblivion our land. XI Round up that brilliant shining stone, And absorb bright light from the sun. Now thou wilt see countless new words That are rushing over our land. XII Apace shall our treasure extend From ominous shadows of old, A pendant of stones rare and grand That scattered all over our land. ==References== Category:National anthems Category:Moldovan anthems Category:National symbols of Moldova",
