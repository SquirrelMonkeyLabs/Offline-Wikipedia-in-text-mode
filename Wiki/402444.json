Despite Miller's efforts to dissuade Murdock, he records Jordan singing a prison-themed song and promotes it to a rival in the jukebox industry. Suspicion arises about Miller and Jordan's relationship, but a manipulated phone conversation convinces Murdock otherwise. At Jordan's debut show, Murdock is targeted for assassination, but Miller saves him, and the success of their song leads to Murdock's signing. The film concludes with Miller and Jordan on their honeymoon as Murdock and his associate perform on TV. ==References== == Other websites == * Four Christmases' Official website * Category:1956 crime movies Category:1956 musical movies Category:1956 romantic comedy movies Category:American criminal comedy movies Category:American musical comedy movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:1950s English-language movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies directed by Frank Tashlin",
