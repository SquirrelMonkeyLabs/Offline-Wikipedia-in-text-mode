 "text": "Haider Ackermann (born 29 March 1971 in Bogotá, Colombia) is a French deseigner of ready-to-wear fashion. He lives in Paris. == Background == In 1998, Ackermann began a five-month internship at John Galliano, building his portfolio over the next few years with designers such as Bernhard Willhelm, Patrick Van Ommeslaeghe and Mayerline. Karl Lagerfeld had gone on record saying that he believed Ackermann a worthy successor to his mantle at Chanel, a fitting compliment for one of fashion’s most talented designers. Ackermann launched his own collection in September 2002. In September 2016, he was entrusted by the Berluti house with the succession of Alessandro Sartori at the head of the artistic direction, to which he remained until April 2018, replaced by Kris Van Assche. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1971 births Category:Businesspeople from Paris Category:French fashion designers Category:Living people",
