 "text": "is a fantasy video game series made by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo. It was created by Masahiro Sakurai. The games are about Kirby, who can fly and eat enemies. When he swallows enemies he will almost always acquire their power. In Kirby games, it's called a \"Copy Ability\". For now, in the whole series, 68 copy abilities have appeared. Most of the games are platform games, but there are games of other genres. == History == The first Kirby game was Kirby's Dream Land, made in 1992 for the Game Boy. It had a small set of levels that each introduced Kirby and the enemy characters. King Dedede was the villain fought at the end of the game. The second Kirby game was Kirby's Adventure, made for the NES. It had many worlds, and each world had its own set of levels. Kirby's Adventure introduced Kirby's power to copy the powers of the enemies he eats. It was the first Kirby game to show Kirby in a pink color. Kirby's Dream Land 2 brought some of Kirby's copy abilities to the Game Boy, as well as a set of worlds like in Kirby's Adventure. Kirby's Dream Land 3, made for the SNES, also used these parts of the game, in a new story. Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards let the player mix the copy abilities together to make new powers for Kirby to use. More Kirby games were made for handheld game consoles: Kirby & the Amazing Mirror for the Game Boy Advance, and Kirby: Squeak Squad for the Nintendo DS. They gave Kirby a large set of copy abilities, like in Kirby's Adventure. Kirby's Return to Dream Land was made in 2011 for the Wii. It showed the modern look of the characters.
