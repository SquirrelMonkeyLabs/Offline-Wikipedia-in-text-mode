 "text": "The plazas de soberanía (, lit. \"strongholds of sovereignty\") is a term describing a series of Spanish overseas minor territories scattered along the Mediterranean coast bordering Morocco or that are closer to Africa than Europe. This term is used for those territories that have been a part of Spain since the formation of the modern country (1492–1556), as opposed to African territories acquired by Spain during the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Scramble for Africa. Historically, a distinction was made between the so- called \"major places of sovereignty\", comprising the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, and the \"minor places of sovereignty\", referring to a number of islands (and a small peninsula) along the coast. In the present, the term refers mainly to the latter. == References == Category:Spanish Africa",
