 "text": "The Amiidae are a family of basal ray-finned fishes in the order Amiiformes. The bowfin (Amia calva) and the eyespot bowfin (Amia ocellicauda) are the only two to survive today, but other than those, a vast majority of them went extinct. Bowfins are found throughout eastern North America, typically in slow-moving backwaters, canals, and oxbow lakes. Amiidae is an ancient group that has numerous synapomorphic characters. Amiidae were widespread and rich in species during the Eocene era. == Taxonomy == === Sinamiidae === Family Sinamiidae * Genus †Siamamia * Genus †Sinamia * Genus †Khoratamia * Genus †Ikechaoamia === Amiinae === Subfamily Amiinae * Genus Amia * Genus †Cyclurus * Genus †Pseudoamiatus == Related pages == * Amiiformes * Acanthopterygii * List of prehistoric bony fish genera == References == * Grande, L.; Bemis, W.E.
