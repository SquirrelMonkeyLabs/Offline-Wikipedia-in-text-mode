 "text": "is the protagonist of the novel series Mushoku Tensei by Rifujin na Magonote. A 34-year-old Japanese NEET is kicked out by his siblings after his parents' death. Feeling his life is pointless, he saves a group of teenagers from a speeding truck and dies. He is then reborn as a baby in a world of sword and sorcery and decides to live his second life to the fullest as Rudeus Greyrat. With inherited affinity for magic and training, he becomes skilled and embarks on a journey to enjoy life and overcome his past. In the Japanese version, Tomokazu Sugita voices his inner thoughts, while Yumi Uchiyama voices the reborn Rudeus. In the English dub, Ben Phillips and Madeleine Morris provide the voices. Critical response to Rudeus is mixed, with some finding his early interactions with young female characters excessively perverted or pedophilic, while others appreciate his growth into a more mature man later on in the show. ==Notes== == References == Category:Characters in written fiction",
