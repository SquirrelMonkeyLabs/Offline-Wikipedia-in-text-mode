 "text": "Shivaji's first raid into Mughal Deccan was a campaign led by the Maratha leader Shivaji. The campaign began when two Maratha leaders, Minaji Bhonsale and Kashi crossed Bhima river and raided Mughal villages in the Chambhargonda and Raisin divisions, late in march of 1657. In the mean time, Shivaji was plundering and looting Junnar, and eventually sacked it around 3rd may, 1657. Aurangzeb on hearing the raids of Marathas, sent army consisting of 5,000 horses to Ahmednagar district of the Mughal Deccan. At the same time, Multafat Khan left the fort of Ahmednagar and rescued the outpost at Chamargunda by defeating Minaji on April 28. But the Marathas stayed in the area for a while longer. Eventually, the soldiers of Multafat Khan and Mirza Khan chased them away and took control of the Chamargunda region. In May 1657, Multafat Khan came back to Ahmednagar, and Nasiri Khan also arrived in the area. At the time, Aurangzeb was attacking Kalyani. After hearing from Multafat Khan that Nasiri Khan planned to invade the Adilshahi region near Paranda, Aurangzeb ordered him in early June to first attack Shivaji's lands in Pune and Chakan, and then move towards Fathabad and Beed to remove the Adilshahi forces. He also told Multafat Khan to send Hoshdar, Abdul Munim, and Tatar Beg to raid Pune and Chakan. The Sabhasad Chronicle says Shivaji later sacked Ahmednagar after raiding Junnar. == Background == The only major army to be found in the Ahmednagar region at that time was when Aurangzeb abandoned Aurangabad to go to Bidar to wage a war against the Adilshahi. Worried about this, Aurangzeb on his way to Bidar, wrote an order and instructed Shahnawaz Khan, Mirza Khan, and Rao Karna, whom he expected to join him to go to Ahmednagar. But Aurangzeb had received the information about Khan Muhammad marching towards Bidar with the Adilshahi troops, and therefore ordered the troops under Shahnawaz Khan and Rao Karna to march to Bidar but Mirza Khan was to continue his march towards Ahmednagar as had been planned. == Raids == === Attack by Minaji Bhonsale === In March 1657, two Maratha leaders, Minaji Bhosale with 3,000 horsemen, and Kashi, crossed the Bhima River and plundered Mughal villages. Minaji Bhosale had captured the Chambhargonda Pargana, which was recaptured by Multafat Khan and Abdul Munim, on 29th April 1657. Around the same time, Shivaji also invaded Mughal territory, and Aurangzeb received a report from Bakhtan Beg, the faujdar of Junnar, that Shivaji was near the town. === Sack of Junnar === Shivaji had already sacked Junnar before Aurangzeb wrote this letter. According to the Jedhe Chronology, Shivaji plundered Junnar in the month of Vaishakh in Shaka 1579 (4th April to 3rd May 1657). Many contemporaneous and later sources also record that Shivaji sacked Junnar. One midnight, Shivaji climbed the walls of Junnar using rope-ladders, killed the guards, and looted 300,000 rupees in cash, 200 horses, and valuable clothes and jewellery. Delhi historian Kambu noted that the Maratha raid succeeded because of the negligence and likely military weakness of the local Mughal officers. === Attack by Kashi === Around this time, Hoshdar and Muhammad Husain, who was sent by Khan Jahan, reached near Ahmednagar. Kashi, had invaded Rashin Pargana. Multafat Khan sent Muhammad Husain to Junnar and Karhe Nimone, while Hoshdar went to deal with Kashi. Aurangzeb approved and ordered Multafat Khan to behead any Deshmukhs, Patils, or peasants who had supported the enemy. Hearing reports of the approaching Imperial force, Shivaji returned from the Junnar area in early May 1657. In May 1657, Multafat Khan returned to Ahmednagar, and Nasiri Khan also arrived in that region around the same time when Aurangzeb had besieged Kalyani. Aurangzeb, on receiving Multafat Khan's message stating that Nasiri Khan had arrived intending to raid the Adilshahi territory around Paranda, ordered him in early June to first plunder Shivaji's territories in Pune and Chakan, to duly proceed toward Fathabad and Bid to crush the Adilshahi forces stationed there. At the same time, Aurangzeb ordered Multafat Khan to send Hoshdar, Abdul Munim, and Tatar Beg, who were positioned at Chambhargonda, into the Pune and Chakan region to conduct a raid. === Sack of Ahmednagar === The Sabhasad Chronicle states that after plundering Junnar, Shivaji had sacked Ahmednagar. Similarly, the Shivabharat says Shivaji had inflicted serious punishment on Ahmednagar and other Mughal towns. However, neither source mentions the month or year of the takeover of Ahmednagar. A letter suggests that the sack of Ahmednagar took place towards the end of May or the beginning of June 1657. Aurangzeb does not mention the attacker in his letter, but it is almost certain that the reference is to Shivaji’s raid on Ahmednagar. Aurangzeb’s praise for Multafat Khan, his report to the Emperor, and the sending of robes of honour to the Khan suggest that Shivaji’s raid was not highly successful. == Result == Around this time, likely after his raid on Ahmednagar, Shivaji and Nasiri Khan clashed in a battle near Ahmednagar. According to the Shivapur Chronology, the battle occurred on 4th June 1657. The outcome is uncertain, as sources provide conflicting accounts. While the Shivabhushan by Kavi Bhushan claims that Shivaji defeated Nasiri Khan, the Amal-i Salih states the opposite. A letter indicates that Nasiri Khan reported his victory over Shivaji. == Aftermath == Shivaji returned to his territory after spending only a few days in the Paranda region. Nasiri Khan stationed Rao Karna at Junnar and Kartalab Khan at Karhe Nimone, also assigning Kartalab additional charge of the Khed post. In June 1657, Nasiri Khan left the Ahmednagar area and moved towards Paranda. Aurangzeb assigned the faujdari of Chambhargonda and Kadevaleet to Hoshdar, while the detachment sent by Khan Jahan to Ahmednagar was recalled. Shivaji seems to have halted his offensive in Mughal territory by June 1657, but Aurangzeb continued to issue instructions against him. == References == Category:India Category:Mughal Empire Category:Maratha Empire Category:17th century in India",
