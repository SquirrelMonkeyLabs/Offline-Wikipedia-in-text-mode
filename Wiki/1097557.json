 "text": "The orange bush frog (Gracixalus seesom) is a frog. It lives in Thailand. Scientists think it could be in Myanmar too. People have seen it between 942 and 1650 meters above sea level. This frog is small. The adult male frog is 22 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is light brown in color. There is some black color on the webbed skin on its feet. This frog lives in rainforests and evergreen forests on hills. People have seen it sitting on twigs. Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on leaves over water or in holes in trees, like other frogs in Gracixalus do. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out, but people do change the places where the frog lives by cutting down forests. The frog does live in some protected parks, for example Thong Pha Phum National Park and Doi Inthanon National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
