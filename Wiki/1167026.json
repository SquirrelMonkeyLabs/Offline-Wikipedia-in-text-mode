 "text": "The Musuh Bisik War (Jawi: ڤرڠ موسوه بيسيق; Thai: กระซิบสงครามศัตรู) is a military conflict that occurred in 1831 between the Rattanakosin Kingdom and the Kedah Sultanate. This war was the rise of the people of Kedah to oppose the Siamese position in Kedah. This war was named the Whispering Enemy because of the surprise attack tactics used by the Siamese side, who seemed to whisper before attacking. This conflict ended with the Siamese occupation of Kedah for 10 years, before Kedah managed to regain Kedah through diplomacy. == References == Category:History of Malaysia Category:History of Thailand Category:18th-century conflicts",
