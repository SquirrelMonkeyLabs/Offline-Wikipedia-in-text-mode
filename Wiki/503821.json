She had a job as a magazine editor. She became pregnant, so she asked her boss for shorter work hours. Osakabe's boss wanted her to quit her job. Osakabe was pregnant twice and she lost the baby twice. Then Osakabe asked for a leave of absence so she could leave her job to become pregnant, then return to the job. Her boss refused. Osakabe quit her job, but she took her case to a labor tribunal. In June, 2014, Osakabe won her case. == Work == Osakabe started a support group called Matahara Net. The word comes from the English words \"maternity and harassment\". The word \"matahara\" is now a legal term. == References == == Other websites == * 2015 International Women of Courage Awards, U.S. State Department photostream on Flickr * Secretary's International Women of Courage Award (U.S. Department of State) Category:Women who received the International Women of Courage Award Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese activists Category:People from Kanagawa Prefecture",
