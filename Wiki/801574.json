After the death of his father in 972, Volodymyr moved to Scandinavia from Novgorod as his brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brothers in order to gain the power in Kyiv. In Sweden and Norway he gathered a Varangian army and took Novgorod from his brother Yaropolk. By 980, Volodymyr had consolidated the Kyiv kingdom from modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and minor parts of modern day Russia. In 981 he captured the Cherven towns from the Poles. In 981–984 he suppressed and conquered a few Slavic tribes including Vyatychi and Radymychi. In 985 Volodymyr made a war against the Volga Bulgars.Janet Martin. Medieval Russia.
