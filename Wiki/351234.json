 "text": "The Northern white rhinoceros, or the Northern square-lipped rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni), is one of the two subspecies of the white rhinoceros. These animals are extinct in the wild, but there were currently seven left in captivity. These seven lived in the Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic. Four of the seven rhinoceroses were transported to Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, Africa, where scientists hope they will successfully breed and save this subspecies from extinction. One of three remaining in the Czech Republic died in late May 2011. The two other rhinoceroses now live at the San Diego Zoo's Safari Park in California. In March 2018, Sudan, the last male white rhinoceros, died after being euthanized.Eyder Peralta (2018) \"Sudan, World's Last Male Northern White Rhino, Dies\" NPR, March 20, 2018.
