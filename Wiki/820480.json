The works with the other Northern Ireland Office ministers.

Scotland and Wales have had the Secretary of State for Scotland (1885) and Secretary of State for Wales (1964) for a long time but Northern Ireland did not have a Secretary. This was caused by the Government of Northern Ireland and Parliament of Northern Ireland. The office of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was created after the Northern Ireland government (at Stormont) was suspended. The government was later ended after civil problems. The British government was worried that the Parliament of Northern Ireland was losing control of the situation. On 30 March 1972, the country was put under the direct rule of the british Parliamen. The Secretary of State replced three jobs from the previous government. These were: * the Governor of Northern Ireland - The main representative of the British monarch * the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland - now the First Minister of Northern Ireland and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland * the Minister of Home Affairs - Now the Minister of Justice Direct rule was expected to last for only a short time. Sharing the pwer was preferred as the solution. It has been renewed by a vote in Parliament each year. The Sunningdale Agreement in 1973 created the Northern Ireland Executive from 1 January 1974. It was ended by the Ulster Workers' Council strike on 28 May 1974. The Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention (1975–1976) and Northern Ireland Assembly (1982–1986) could not restore the government. Following the Belfast Agreement (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) on 10 April 1998 removed many of the duties of the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland Office. Many of the powers of the Secretary have been given to the Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive. The secretary of state in now limited to representing Northern Ireland in the UK cabinet and controling the operation of the administration. They are also in charge of several other areas. These include security, human rights, some public inquiries and elections. The secretary of state officially lives in Hillsborough Castle. It was the official home of the governor of Northern Ireland. The castle is still a royal residence of the monarch in Northern Ireland. == List of secretaries of state for Northern Ireland == Portrait Name Term of office Term of office Length of term Party Prime Minister William Whitelaw MP for Penrith and The Border 24 March 1972 2 December 1973 Conservative Edward Heath Francis Pym MP for Cambridgeshire 2 December 1973 4 March 1974 Conservative Edward Heath Merlyn Rees MP for Leeds South 5 March 1974 10 September 1976 Labour Harold Wilson Roy Mason MP for Barnsley 10 September 1976 4 May 1979 Labour James Callaghan Humphrey Atkins MP for Spelthorne 5 May 1979 14 September 1981 Conservative Margaret Thatcher Jim Prior MP for Lowestoft (until 1983) MP for Waveney (from 1983) 14 September 1981 11 September 1984 Conservative Margaret Thatcher Douglas Hurd MP for Witney 11 September 1984 3 September 1985 Conservative Margaret Thatcher Tom King MP for Bridgwater 3 September 1985 24 July 1989 Conservative Margaret Thatcher Peter Brooke MP for Cities of London and Westminster South 24 July 1989 10 April 1992 Conservative Margaret Thatcher Peter Brooke MP for Cities of London and Westminster South 24 July 1989 10 April 1992 Conservative John Major Sir Patrick Mayhew MP for Tunbridge Wells 10 April 1992 2 May 1997 Conservative John Major Mo Mowlam MP for Redcar 3 May 1997 11 October 1999 Labour Tony Blair Peter Mandelson MP for Hartlepool 11 October 1999 24 January 2001 Labour Tony Blair John Reid MP for Hamilton North and Bellshill 25 January 2001 24 October 2002 Labour Tony Blair Paul Murphy MP for Torfaen 24 October 2002 6 May 2005 Labour Tony Blair Peter Hain MP for Neath (also Welsh Secretary) 6 May 2005 28 June 2007 Labour Tony Blair Shaun Woodward MP for St Helens South 28 June 2007 11 May 2010 Labour Gordon Brown Owen Paterson MP for North Shropshire 12 May 2010 4 September 2012 Conservative David Cameron (Coalition) Theresa Villiers MP for Chipping Barnet 4 September 2012 14 July 2016 Conservative David Cameron (Coalition) David Cameron (II) Theresa Villiers MP for Chipping Barnet 4 September 2012 14 July 2016 Conservative James Brokenshire MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup 14 July 2016 8 January 2018 Conservative Theresa May Karen Bradley MP for Staffordshire Moorlands 8 January 2018 24 July 2019 Conservative Theresa May Julian Smith MP for Skipton and Ripon 24 July 2019 13 February 2020 Conservative Boris Johnson Brandon Lewis MP for Great Yarmouth 13 February 2020 7 July 2022 Conservative Boris Johnson Shailesh Vara MP for North West Cambridgeshire 7 July 2022 6 September 2022 Conservative Boris Johnson Chris Heaton-Harris MP for Daventry 6 September 2022 5 July 2024 Conservative Liz Truss Chris Heaton-Harris MP for Daventry 6 September 2022 5 July 2024 Conservative Rishi Sunak Hilary Benn MP for Leeds South 5 July 2024 Incumbent * Labour Keir Starmer * Incumbent's length of term last updated: . ==Notes== Category:1972 establishments in the United Kingdom",
