 "text": "Robert the Magnificent () (22 June 1000 - 1/3 July 1035), was the sixth Duke of Normandy from 1027 until he died returning from a pilgrimage. Robert's reign was a turbulent period in the history of Normandy. He was the father of William the Conqueror, who in 1066 became King of England. == Career == Robert was the second son of Richard II of Normandy and Judith.The Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumieges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni, Vol. II, Books V-VIII, ed. Elisabeth M.C. Van Houts (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995), pp. 40-1 He was probably born between 1005 and 1010.David C. Douglas, William the Conqueror (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964), p. 15 Their father had decided that the older son, Richard III, would succeed him as duke. Robert would became Count of Hiémois. In August 1026 their father, Richard II, died and Richard III became the fifth duke. But once Richard III began to reign, Robert was not satisfied with his position. He raided the diocese of his uncle Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen.David Crouch, The Normans: The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 46 He also captured his brother's fortress city of Falaise. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027.David C. Douglas, William the Conqueror (Berkeley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1964), p. 32 Finally Richard III laid siege to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised his fealty. ===Early reign=== When Richard III died shortly after Robert's surrender, there were suspicions that Robert might have caused his brother's death.David C. Douglas, William the Conqueror (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964), p. 32 Robert was accepted, however, as the sixth duke following his brother. But the civil war Robert I had started against his brother Richard III didn't stop when the two made peace. There were still many feuds which had started between neighboring barons. These continued in Normandy during much of Robert’s reign. It was also during this time that many of the lesser nobility left Normandy to seek their fortunes in southern Italy and elsewhere. Soon after he became duke and possibly in revenge for supporting his brother, Robert I gathered an army and began raiding the lands of his uncle, Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen.David Crouch, The Normans, The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2002), p. 48 Only a brief truce allowed his uncle to leave Normandy in exile. The Archbishop then placed an edict of excommunication on Robert and all of Normandy. The edict was only removed when Archbishop Robert was allowed to return and all his lands were restored. Robert also attacked another powerful church leader, his cousin Hugo d'Ivry, Bishop of Bayeux. Robert banished him from Normandy.François Neveux. A Brief History of The Normans (Constable & Robbinson, Ltd, London, 2008), p. 100 Robert also seized a number of church properties belonging to the abbey of Fécamp.David Crouch, The Normans, The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2002), p. 49 ===Outside of Normandy=== In spite of all his troubles in Normandy Robert decided to get involved in the civil war in Flanders.David Crouch, The Normans, The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2002), pp. 49-50 This feud was between Baldwin V, Count of Flanders and his father Baldwin IV who the younger Baldwin had driven out of Flanders. Baldwin V, supported by king Robert II of France, his father-in-law, was persuaded to make peace with his father in 1030. This happened only after Duke Robert promised the elder Baldwin his military support. Robert gave shelter to Henry I of France against his mother, Queen Constance. The queen wanted her younger son Robert to succeed his father Robert II as king of France.Elisabeth M C Van Houts, The Normans in Europe (Manchester University Press, Manchester and New York, 2000), p. 185 For his help Henry I gave Robert the French Vexin. In the early 1030s Alan III, Duke of Brittany began to expand from the area of Rennes and appeared to have wanted the area around Mont Saint-MichelDavid Crouch, The Normans, The History of a Dynasty (Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2002), p. 50 After raiding Dol and stopping Alan's attempts to raid Avranches, Robert mounted a major campaign against his cousin Alan III. However, Alan appealed to Archbishop Robert of Rouen (they were both his nephews). The Archbishop arranged a peace between Duke Robert and his vassal Alan III. Robert's cousins, the Athelings Edward and Alfred, had been living in exile at the Norman Court. They were the sons of his aunt Emma of Normandy and Athelred, King of England.Christopher Harper-Bill; Elisabeth Van Houts, A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World (Boydell Press, Woodbridge, UK, 2003), p. 31 At some point Robert attempted an invasion of England on their behalf but was stopped by unfavorable winds. The king of England, Cnut the Great sent envoys to Duke Robert offering to settle half the Kingdom of England on Edward and Alfred.The Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumièges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni, Ed. & Trans. Elizabeth M.C. Van Houts, Vol. I (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992), pp. 78-80 After postponing the invasion he chose to also postpone the decision until after he returned from Jerusalem. ===The Church and his pilgrimage=== Robert's attitude towards the Church changed completely since his uncle's return from exile.François Neveux. A Brief History of The Normans (Constable & Robbinson, Ltd, London, 2008), p. 102 To make up for what he had done to the Church earlier he restored all the property that he or his vassals had taken.François Neveux. A Brief History of The Normans (Constable & Robbinson, Ltd, London, 2008), p. 103 He also decided to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to make up for his sins.Samuel Griswold Goodrich, A pictorial history of France (Philadelphia, E.H. Butler & Co., 1861), p. 65 After making his illegitimate son William his heir, he set out on his pilgrimage.The Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumièges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni, Ed. & Trans. Elizabeth M.C. Van Houts, Vol. I (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992), pp. 80-5 He travelled by way of Constantinople and reached Jerusalem. He fell seriously ill and died on the return journey at Nicaea on 2 July 1035. His son William, aged about eight, succeeded him.François Neveux, A Brief History of the Normans, trans. Howard Curtis (Constable & Robinson, Ltd. London, 2008), p. 110 According to the historian William of Malmesbury, decades later, Robert's son William sent a mission to Constantinople and Nicaea to return his father's body to Normandy for burial.William M. Aird, Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy: C. 1050-1134 (Boydell Press, Woodbridge, UK, 2008), p. 159 n. 38 Permission was granted, but, having travelled as far as Apulia (Italy) on the return journey, the envoys learned that William himself had died. They then decided to reinter Robert's body in Italy. ==Issue== By his concubine, Herleva of Falaise, he was father of: * William the Conqueror (c.1028–1087).David C.
