 "text": "A jumpsuit is a one-piece garment with sleeves and legs. It has no coverings for feet, hands or head. The original jump suit is the functional one-piece garment used by parachuters. Jumpsuits are garments of convenience, as they're quicker to put on and remove than outfits with two or more pieces. Variants of jumpsuits include flight suits, made of thicker fabric to retain heat, rompers, short-sleeved suits with often shorts instead of trousers, short- sleeved orange or striped suits used in North America as prison uniforms, and onesies, track suit style jumpsuits sometimes worn as pyjamas.
