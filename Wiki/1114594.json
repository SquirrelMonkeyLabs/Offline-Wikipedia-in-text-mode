Its goal was to spread Mahathir's views in rural areas. This happened during conflicts between Mahathir and the administration of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Business friends of Mahathir funded the newspaper. The front page said 'Let Mahathir speak!' Inside, the paper had speeches by Mahathir calling Abdullah a liar and coward unfit for his position. ==References== Category:Politics of Malaysia Category:Mahathir Mohamad",
