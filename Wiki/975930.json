 "text": "An extragalactic planet, known as an extragalactic exoplanet or an extroplanet, is a star-bound planet or rogue planet located outside of the Milky Way Galaxy. Due to the very far distances to such worlds, they would be very hard to detect instantly. However, indirect evidence suggests that such far planets exist. Nonetheless, the most distant planets known are SWEEPS-11 and SWEEPS-04, these two stars are located in Sagittarius with a distance of approximately 27,710 light years from the Sun, while the Milky Way is between 100,000 and 180,000 light years in diameter. This means that even galactic planets located farther than that distance have not been detected. == References == Category:Planets",
