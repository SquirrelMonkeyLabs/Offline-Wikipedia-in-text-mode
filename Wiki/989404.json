Female celebrities such as Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, made displaying whale tails popular in the early 2000s. Low-rise jeans and thong panties became popular at the same time Low-waisted trousers, such as low-rise jeans or hip-huggers, and higher-cut thongs led to greater exposure of the whale tail.Garchik, Leah (2004-08-23). \"Daily Datebook\".
