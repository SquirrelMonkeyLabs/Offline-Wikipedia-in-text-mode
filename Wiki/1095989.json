 "text": "The Phillipine flying frog, southeast Asian tree frog, brown-eyed tree frog, frilled tree frog, rough frill-armed tree frog, or rough-armed tree frog (Kurixalus appendiculatus) is a frog. It lives in the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. People have seen it between 0 and 500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and forests that have been cut down and are growing back. This frog lives near streams with slow water and in swamps. People have seen them on woody plants. The tadpoles swim in puddles and small pools where the water does not move. These frogs fight each other over good places to look for food. It only eats a few kinds of food, mostly animals without spines. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms for palm oil. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
