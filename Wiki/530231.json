 "text": "Unilateral disarmament is a policy option where a single country disarms or renounces weapons without expecting other nations or rivals to also renounce their use of weapons. It was most commonly used in the twentieth century in the context of unilateral nuclear disarmament, a recurrent mission of peace movements in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Nations do not often choose to dismantle their entire military capability. Unilateral disarmament is usually sought in one technical competency, such as weapons of mass destruction. Non-violent political movements from that of Mahatma Gandhi to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament have recommended unilateral disarmament as a step toward world peace. == References == Category:Politics by issue",
