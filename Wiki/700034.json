It is now led by John Woolley as King John. The Kingdom referred to itself as a Micronation for many years, however now referred to as a country. == Etymology == The name Talossa comes from the Finnish word talossa, meaning \"inside the house\" (that is, the root talo meaning house or building, in the inessive case). It was selected by the country's founder, Robert Ben Madison, because it described the kingdom's territorial claim (then limited to his bedroom). ==References== Category:Antarctic territorial claims Category:Geography of Antarctica Category:Micronations Category:Milwaukee Category:Republics",
