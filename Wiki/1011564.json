People have seen it between 1300 and 1550 meters above sea level. This frog lives in a type of forest called primary rainforest. That is rainforest that has never been cut down. It lives on mountains. The adult male frog is about 43.4 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog is green in color with white spots. There is webbed skin on the front feet and back feet. The inner parts of the legs are yellow or reddish in color. The iris of the eye is silver in color with some gold color on the top. The frog sounds like \"Auuu\" when it sings. The tadpoles swim in water. The name \"Yinggelin\" means \"Mountain of parrots\" in Chinese. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of dying out because it lives in only one place, the Yinggeling Mountains. Scientists think climate change could hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
