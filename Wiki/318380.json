 "text": "Enzo Favio Fortuny (born June 7, 1981 in Veracruz, Mexico) is a Latin American voice actor. He is always credited as Enzo Fortuny. While he remains as a specialist in young men's voices, his range is ample enough to allow him to portray either gentler roles (like Yukito Tsukishiro) or much rougher ones (like InuYasha). He is the Latin American Disney XD channel speaker and the official Latin American Dub-over artist of Drake Bell and Elijah Wood. ==Filmography== * The Lord of the Rings movies series (2001 & 2002) - Frodo Baggins (voiceover for Elijah Wood) (all Latino Versions) * InuYasha (2002–2006) - InuYasha (Latino Version) * Harry Potter movie series - Fred and George Weasley (Latino Version) * Toy Story - Sid (Latino Version) * Drake & Josh (2004–2007) - Drake Parker (Latino Version) ==References== Category:Child actors Category:Mexican movie actors Category:Mexican voice actors Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Veracruz",
