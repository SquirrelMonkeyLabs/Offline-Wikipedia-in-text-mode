 "text": "Gomoku Narabe Renju is a Japanese exclusive Famicom video game released in 1983. The game was later re-released in Japan on the Wii's Virtual Console years later. It was one of the first games to be released on the console. The game is a version of the Japanese video game known outside of the country as connect-five. The cartridge's color is black. A successor to the game, titled Super Gomoku Narabe Renju, was released on the Super Famicom. It, alongside Mahjong, was also released in the Japanese version of Animal Crossing, called Animal Forest +, as a collectible NES/Famicom game (in the overseas version, this was replaced with either Soccer or Excitebike). Other than the ports as mentioned earlier of the 1983 version for the Japanese version of Animal Crossing and Virtual Console, it has not been released again or made a second game of since. == Gameplay == Before starting the game, the player can choose between three difficulty levels, ranging from easy to medium to hard. Next, you can choose if you wish to play with a computer player or another person. Each player has an assigned color: either black or white. During each turn, the player will place a chip down on the grid board. The first player to create a row of 5 chips of one color wins. == Other websites == * Virtual Console page on Nintendo's official website (Japanese). * Gomoku Narabe Renju at GameFAQs Category:Famicom Disk System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:1983 video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Virtual Console games Category:2006 video games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
