The poles were made from bamboo sticks, or other strong but flexible woods. The kite line was made from string, or twine. Modern kites are made from synthetic materials, such as ripstop nylon or more exotic fabrics on the sails. They have fiberglass or carbon fiber poles, and use dacron or dyneema for the kite lines. Today, there are different types of kites. Some are large and are made to look good. Some are smaller and are made for speed, children and competitions. Also, there are many different types of kites.
