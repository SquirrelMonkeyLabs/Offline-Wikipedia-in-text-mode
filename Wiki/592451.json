 "text": "Paul Delos Boyer (July 31, 1918 - June 2, 2018) was an American biochemist, analytical chemist, and a professor of chemistry at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Boyer shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for research on the \"enzymatic mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\" (ATP synthase) with John E. Walker, making Boyer the only Utah-born Nobel laureate; the remainder of the Prize in that year was awarded to Danish chemist Jens Christian Skou for his discovery of the Na+/K+-ATPase. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Boyer died two months shy of his 100th birthday in Los Angeles, California on June 2, 2018 of respiratory failure.In memoriam: Paul Boyer, 99, Nobel laureate in chemistryPaul D.
