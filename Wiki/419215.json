 "text": "Striptease is a 1996 comedy-drama movie. Striptease is based on a novel by the same name, which was released three years prior to the movie. The stories in this movie are about an exotic dancer who gets involved in serious child custody matters and corrupt politics. Demi Moore is exotic dancer Erin Grant, who was earlier a Federal Bureau of Investigation secretary. Also in the movie is Burt Reynolds as Congressman David Dildeck and Rumer Willis (Moore's real- life daughter) as Erin's daughter Angela. Striptease got negative reviews similar to Showgirls the previous year. Unlike Striptease, however, Showgirls became a strong cult favorite within one decade after its release.
