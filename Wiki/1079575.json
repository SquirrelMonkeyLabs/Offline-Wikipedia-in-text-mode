 "text": "Battery swapping is an electric vehicle technology that enables the rapid exchange of a depleted battery with a fully charged one. This method provides a swift alternative to traditional charging, commonly applied in electric forklifts. It offers an efficient solution for maintaining electric vehicle functionality without prolonged charging delays. == History == As far back as 1896, people were talking about a service where you could swap out a used-up battery for a fully charged one. The Hartford Electric Light Company actually started offering this service between 1910 and 1924. They did this through the GeVeCo battery service, mainly for electric trucks. If you owned a vehicle, you'd buy it without a battery and then get one separately from the General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), which was partly owned by General Electric. Beginning in 1917, a similar service operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Electric cars. A rapid battery replacement system was implemented to service 50 electric buses at the 2008 Summer Olympics. == References == Category:Electric vehicles",
