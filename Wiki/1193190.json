 "text": "The chapel of Saint Mary Queen of Peace is a Catholic church located in Villa Las Estrellas, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, in the Chilean commune of Antartica, within the Magallanes Region and Chilean Antarctica, approximately 1580 km from Punta Arenas. The temple is basically a large metal container, modified to resemble a temple, with electricity and a suitable heating system inside. Religious ceremonies are performed by a deacon, who lives permanently in the village. The chapel is fairly new. It was built near the end of the 20th century. Today it is the southernest Catholic church in Chile and one of the most southern in the world. It is also one of only seven Christian churches in Antarctica, which are the continentâ€™s only places for religious worship. == References == Category:Antarctica",
