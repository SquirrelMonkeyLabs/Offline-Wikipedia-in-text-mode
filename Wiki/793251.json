Castile was driving with his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter when they were pulled over by Officer Yanez and his partner. Yanez asked Castile for his license and registration and Castile told him that he was legally carrying a firearm. The officers told him not to reach for it, to which Castile told them he was not reaching for his weapon. Yanez fired 7 rounds at close range, hitting Castile 5 times. Castile died 20 minutes later.https://www.ramseycounty.us/sites/default/files/County%20Attorney/Exhibit%201a%20-%20Traffic%20Stop%20Transcript.pdfhttps://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MNHENNE/2016/07/07/file_attachments/582665/2016-3828%2BCastile%252C%2BPhilando.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170607174350/http://www.startribune.com/the- latest-lab-supervisor-traces-bullets-in-castile-car/427038431/ == References == Category:People shot and killed by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Black Lives Matter",
