 "text": "The AEW Women's World Championship is a professional wrestling championship in All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It is the top women's championship in AEW. ==History== The title was introduced by Brandi Rhodes in a segment at All Out on August 31, 2019. The first champion was Riho, who defeated Nyla Rose in the main event on the October 2 debut episode of Dynamite. During Thunder Rosa's first reign as champion, she got injured. AEW president Tony Khan said that Rosa would keep the championship but a new interim champion would be crowned. The interim champion would then face Rosa after she returned from injury to see who would become the undisputed champion. Toni Storm defeated Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D., Jamie Hayter, and Hikaru Shida in a four-way match at All Out. Storm would lose the interim championship to Jamie Hayter at Full Gear. Hayter became the official champion when Thunder Rosa gave the original championship up. This made Hayter's interim reign official. \"Timeless\" Toni Storm is the current champion. She is in her fourth reign as champion, which is the most for the title. She defeated Mariah May at Grand Slam Australia. == Title history == == References == == Other websites == *Official website Category:All Elite Wrestling championships",
