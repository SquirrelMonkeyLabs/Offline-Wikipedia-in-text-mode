 "text": "The Vice-President of Zambia is the second highest position in the executive branch of the Republic of Zambia. The Vice-President was previously appointed by the President before the amendment of the Constitution in 2016. Under the amended Constitution, when a sitting President dies, resigns or is removed from office, the Vice-President automatically assumes the presidency, unlike when the Constitution demanded holding of presidential by-election within 90 days. This is so because now every presidential candidate shall pick a running mate for Vice-President and the two will share the vote meaning voting for a President is an automatic vote for the Vice-President. The Vice-President also heads the Office of the Vice-President, a government ministry. ==List== Portrait Name Took office Left office Political party Kenneth Kaunda 22 January 1964 24 October 1964 UNIP Reuben Kamanga 24 October 1964 October 1967 UNIP Simon Kapwepwe October 1967 October 1970 UNIP Mainza Chona October 1970 August 1973 UNIP Mainza Chona 25 August 1973 27 May 1975 UNIP Elijah Mudenda 27 May 1975 20 July 1977 UNIP Mainza Chona 20 July 1977 15 June 1978 UNIP Daniel Lisulo 15 June 1978 18 February 1981 UNIP Nalumino Mundia 18 February 1981 24 April 1985 UNIP Kebby Musokotwane 24 April 1985 15 March 1989 UNIP Malimba Masheke 15 March 1989 31 August 1991 UNIP Levy Mwanawasa 7 November 1991 3 July 1994 MMD Godfrey Miyanda 4 July 1994 2 December 1997 MMD Christon Tembo 2 December 1997 April 2001 MMD Enoch Kavindele 4 May 2001 29 May 2003 MMD Nevers Mumba 29 May 2003 4 October 2004 MMD Lupando Mwape 4 October 2004 September 2006 MMD Rupiah Banda 9 October 2006 2 November 2008 MMD George Kunda 2 November 2008 23 September 2011 MMD Guy Scott 23 September 2011 28 October 2014 PF Inonge Wina 26 January 2015 24 August 2021 PF Mutale Nalumango 24 August 2021 Incumbent UPND ==References== Zambia Category:1964 establishments in Africa Category:1991 establishments in Africa",
