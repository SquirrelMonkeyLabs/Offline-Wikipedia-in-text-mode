 "text": "osu! is a rhythm game made by Dean \"Peppy\" Herbert in 2007. It has gotten good reviews and has been recommended by professional gamers as a way of improving cursor aim and gaining advantage in other games. A repository of the game, mostly written in C#, can be found in GitHub. Most of the levels (beatmaps) are made by the community, which are made with the game's level creator. osu! has 4 game modes, osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania. osu!standard, as its name suggests, is the most popular one. osu! started as a PC emulation of the DS game Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan. Peppy made it during an all-nighter, and released the first version on July 1st, 2007 to a few of his friends. After receiving positive feedback, he worked more on the project, adding additional features to the game. Some features, namely a custom level creator and leaderboards, were not included in the original game, which further increased the appeal of the game. After the creation of a website osu.ppy.sh, multiplayer, and increased custom level quality and quantity, what was initially a small project eventually eclipsed the game it emulated. As of 2024, osu! has tens of millions of accounts considered active, and over 17 billion total plays. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2007 video games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Music video games Category:Windows games",
