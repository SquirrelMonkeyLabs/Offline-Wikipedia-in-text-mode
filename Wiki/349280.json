He was a semi-regular on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis during its first season (1959–60). Beatty made his movie debut in Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass (1961), opposite Natalie Wood. In 1967, when he was 28, he produced and acted alongside Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackman in Bonnie and Clyde. It was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, and seven Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor.
