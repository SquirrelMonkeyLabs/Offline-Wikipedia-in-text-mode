 "text": "The Watford DC line is a commuter railway line from London Euston to Watford Junction in Watford, Hertfordshire. Its services are operated by London Overground. The line runs beside the West Coast Main Line (WCML) for most of its length. The London Underground Bakerloo line shares the section of the line from Queen's Park to Harrow & Wealdstone. The rolling stock used on the line is Class 378 \"Capitalstar\". The \"DC\" in the title refers to line being electrified using direct current. This was done in the early twentieth century by the London and North Western Railway. By contrast the WCML uses alternating current from overhead lines. == Related pages == * LNWR electric units Category:London Overground Category:Rail transport in London Category:Watford",
