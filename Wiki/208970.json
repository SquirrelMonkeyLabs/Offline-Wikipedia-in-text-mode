 "text": "The 2007 SuccessTech Academy shooting was a School shooting at SuccessTech Academy in Cleveland, Ohio on October 10, 2007. 14 year old Asa H Coon shot 2 students and 2 teachers injuring them before committing suicide in a classroom on the fourth floor of the building. Asa Coon, a student at the school, entered the school shortly before 1pm armed with two revolvers and three tactical folding knives. After being punched in the face for bumping into Michael Peek, Coon shot Peek in the abdomen around 1:03pm as he walked away. He walked through the school's halls shooting at another student, Darnell Rodgers, but the bullet just scratched Rodgers, hurting his elbow. Then Coon went to a social studies class where he shot the teacher Michael Grassie in the chest. Another teacher, David Kachadourian, was shot in the shoulder while helping his students get to a safe place. A 14-year-old student, Trinnetta McGrady, had knee and back injuries from being stepped on in a hallway by students who were trying to get away. The shooting ended when Coon walked into a empty classroom and fatally shot himself in the right side of his head. A controversial crime scene photo taken of Coon after his suicide was leaked to the public from a radio disc jockey from the Rover's Morning Glory show. A Cleveland police officer Walter Emerick, who took the picture using his camera phone was suspended from his job for eight days for sending the photo to other people, eventually leading to it being leaked on the Internet. ==References== Category:2007 in the United States Category:2000s in Cleveland, Ohio Category:2000s crimes in the United States Category:Deaths by firearm in the United States Category:Suicide",
