 "text": "The Treaty of London was a treaty that was signed on 30 May 1913 and moved borders of countries after the First Balkan War. The Balkan League, made up of Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Montenegro, won the war from the Ottoman Empire. One important border to decide was Albania, which had declared its independence on 28 November 1912. All of the Ottoman Empire except Albania was given to the Balkan League. Because not everyone was happy with the Treaty of London, the Second Balkan War started on June 13. Peace came after the Treaty of Bucharest was signed on 12 August 1913. It caused tension between what became the Allied Powers and the Central Powers and helped start World War I.
