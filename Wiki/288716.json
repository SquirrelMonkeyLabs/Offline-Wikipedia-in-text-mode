 "text": "Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (18 July 1853 – 4 February 1928) was a Dutch physicist. In 1902, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect. He also derived the transformation equations that were later used by Albert Einstein to describe space and time. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Hendrik Lorentz was born in Arnhem, Gelderland (The Netherlands), the son of Gerrit Frederik Lorentz (1822–1893). In 1862, after his mother's death, his father married Luberta Hupkes. ===Career=== ====Lorentz and special relativity==== In 1905, Einstein would use many of the concepts to write his paper entitled \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\",. See also: English translation. known today as the theory of special relativity. Because Lorentz laid the fundamentals for the work by Einstein, this theory was originally called the Lorentz-Einstein theory. ====Lorentz and general relativity==== Lorentz was one of few scientists who supported Einstein's search for general relativity from the beginning – he wrote several research papers and discussed with Einstein personally and by letter. For instance, he attempted to combine Einstein's formalism with Hamilton's principle (1915). ===Death=== In January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on February 4. ==Related pages== *Lorentz force ==References== ==Other websites== *in the Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science, Amsterdam Category:1853 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Dutch academics Category:Dutch Nobel Prize winners Category:People from Arnhem Category:Dutch theoretical physicists",
