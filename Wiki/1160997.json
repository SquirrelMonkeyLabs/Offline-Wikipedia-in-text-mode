 "text": "An American Viticultural Area (AVA) is a place named by the government as a wine grape-growing region in the United States. This helps wineries and wine drinkers. Wineries want their drinkers to know about where their wine is from. This is because wine has different flavor if its wine grapes are grown in certain places. Wine drinkers look for AVAs they enjoy and some wines from popular AVAs cost more. If a bottle of wine has an AVA label, at least 85% of the grapes of the wine are grown in the AVA and the wine must be finished in the same state as the AVA. == Related pages == * Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée == References == Category:United States geography-related lists Category:Wine Category:Wine regions",
