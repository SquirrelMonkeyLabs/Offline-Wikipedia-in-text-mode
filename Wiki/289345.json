 "text": "Snowball is a fictional character in The Simpsons. Snowball is the Simpson family's pet cat. She first appeared in the episode, I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot. There have been five cats in the Simpson family, and the current cat is named Snowball V (later renamed Snowball II). The first version of Snowball was killed when it was run over by a Chrysler, and the second cat, Snowball II, was run over by Dr. Hibbert's Mercedes-Benz G500. Snowball III drowned trying to catch a goldfish in the aquarium while Lisa was in the kitchen preparing his cat food for the first time. The fourth cat was named Coltrane (but was also known as Snowball IV) and was killed when she jumped out of a window after being scared by Lisa's saxophone. The cats were not all the same color; some were white, some were black, and another one looked like Bart. They all died except for Snowball V, the newest cat, which was given to Lisa by the crazy cat lady.
