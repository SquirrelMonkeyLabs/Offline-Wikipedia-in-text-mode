 "text": "Pig is a jeopardy (risk) dice game played with one die. In jeopardy dice games, a player decides to roll or hold (stop rolling). A player that rolls risks a turn total, and may gain a higher turn total or score nothing. A player that holds scores the turn total. John Scarne wrote about Pig as a common dice game in 1945.Scarne, John. 1945. Scarne on Dice. Harrisburg, PA: Military Service Publishing Co. Optimal (perfect) play has been computed.Todd W. Neller and Clifton G.M. Presser. Optimal Play of the Dice Game Pig, The UMAP Journal 25(1) (2004), pp. 25â€“47. Teachers often use Pig for fun lessons.Links to Pig websites Computer Science Resources for the Game of Pig == Rules == On a player's turn, a player can roll or hold: *roll: The player can roll a die. **When a player rolls a 1 (called a \"pig\"), the turn ends and the player score does not change. **When a player rolls a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the turn continues and the player adds the roll to the turn total. *hold: The player says \"hold\" and gives the die to the next player. **When a player \"holds\", the turn ends and the player adds the turn total to the score. The first player to score 100 or more points wins. == Example play == For example, Ann begins a turn with a roll of 5. She could hold and score 5 points, but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 2. She could hold with a turn total of 7 points (2 + 5 = 7), but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 1 (\"pig\"). She must end her turn. Her score does not change. She hands the dice to the next player, Bob. Bob rolls a 4, 5, 3, 5, and 5. He then decides to hold. Bob adds 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 22 points to his score. ==References== == Other websites == * The Game of Pig website * Pig applet Category:Dice games",
