 "text": "Lake Göygöl is the second largest lake in Azerbaijan. The lake has a length of 48 km and stretches to widths of up to 3 km across. It is named after a 14th- century Azerbaijani king, Huseyn Göygöl who ruled his kingdom and military forces just kilometres from the water, and used it as their main water source. Lake Göygöl is now known today as a secluded lake that regional people use for fishing and swimming. The lake contains a heightened amount of calcium and oxohydroxide within the water. This has caused some local fish (The Fauna of Azerbaijani) to grow up to 4x their regular size. Category:Lakes of Azerbaijan",
