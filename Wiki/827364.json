 "text": "Boana is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. They are called gladiator frogs, gladiator treefrogs or Wagler Neotropical treefrogs. These frogs live in tropical Central and South America from Nicaragua to Argentina. They also live in the Caribbean, in Trinidad and Tobago. For a while, scientists thought using this genus was a mistake. They started using it again after taking a long look again at Hylidae. They decided that about 70 species that they had put in the genus Hyla should be in Boana instead. Since then, scientists have written reports about many newly discovered Boana species. ==Species== As of April 2020, there are 95 species of frogs in this genus: Hyla palliata and Hypsiboas hypselops are also listed in this article because scientists are not sure about them. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Frogs of South America",
