It is listed as critically endangered on IUCN's Red List, due to its location range being less than 5 square kilometers and because of deforestation of the mangroves in which they live. The pygmy three toed sloth is not prey to any natural predator, as it lives on an isolated island where there aren't many other animals. == Diet == Pygmy three toed sloths eat the leaves from various trees. == Appearance == The fur of the pygmy three toed sloth is covered with algae.
