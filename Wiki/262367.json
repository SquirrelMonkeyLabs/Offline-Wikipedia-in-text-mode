The straight is about 25km long. The water is not very deep. There are two bridges over the strait. The A5 road (which goes all the way to central London), goes across by the Menai Suspension Bridge. There is also the Britannia Tubular Bridge. Category:Geography of Anglesey Category:Straits of Europe Category:Bodies of water of the United Kingdom",
