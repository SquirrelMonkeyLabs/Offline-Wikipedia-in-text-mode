 "text": "The At-Taqwa Mosque () is a mosque in Dayuan Township, Taoyuan County, Taiwan. It is the seventh and latest mosque in Taiwan. The mosque was built in 2013. ==History== The construction of the mosque was started by an Indonesian- Taiwanese couple who had an Indonesian shop around Dayuan. The couple purchased a land beside their shop to build a mosque. After collecting all of the money needed to make the mosque, the mosque was finally constructed and opened on 9 June 2013. The establishment of the mosque shows that the number of Muslims is growing in Taiwan, where many of them work in factories, shops or houses. Many of those Muslims come from Indonesia. This can be considered as the fourth Muslim migration to Taiwan. ==Architecture== The mosque area is 130 square meters. It has three floors, where it consists of male prayer hall, female prayer hall, guess room, classes and dormitories. ==References== Category:Mosques in Taiwan Category:2013 establishments in Asia Category:2010s establishments in Taiwan",
