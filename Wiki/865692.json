 "text": "Marie (born Princess Marie Alexandra Victoria of Edinburgh; 29 October 1875 â€“ 18 July 1938) was the last Queen of Romania from 1914 to 1927 as the wife of King Ferdinand I. She was the first born daughter of Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. She was also a granddaughter both Emperor Alexander II and Queen Victoria. Marie's early years were spent in Kent, Malta and Coburg. After refusing a proposal from her cousin, the future King George V, she was chosen as the future wife of Ferdinand, then crown prince of Romania, in 1892. Marie was crown princess between 1893 and 1914, and became immediately popular with the Romanian people. In 1930, Marie's eldest son Carol, who had waived his rights to succession, deposed his son and usurped the throne, becoming King Carol II. He removed Marie from the political scene and strove to crush her popularity. Afterwards Marie moved away from Bucharest and spent the rest of her life either in the countryside or at Balchik Palace, her summer residence in Southern Dobruja by the Black Sea. In 1937, she became ill with cirrhosis and died in 1938. == References == Category:1875 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Deaths from cirrhosis Category:English Anglicans Category:People from Ashford, Kent Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland)",
