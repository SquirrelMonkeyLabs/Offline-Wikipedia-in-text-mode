While some other kinds of asteroids cross over Mars' and Earth's orbits, nearly all of the amor asteroids do not. The best known amor asteroid is 433 Eros. It circled around and landed upon by the NEAR Shoemaker. About 1,200 of all the asteroids in space are amor asteroids, with about 200 of them numbered, or given a number.
