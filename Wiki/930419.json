 "text": "The Brisbane Lions are a professional Australian rules football club from Brisbane, Queensland, that plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). The club was formed in 1996 when the Fitzroy Lions and the Brisbane Bears merged. They are the most successful AFL club in the 2000s, having been in four AFL Grand Finals in a row, winning in 2001, 2002 and 2003 (although losing the 2004). Their current home ground in the AFL is The Gabba and their current home ground in the AFLW is Brighton Homes Arena. == Training == The Brisbane Lions train at Brighton Homes Arena with the men's team main coach being Chris Fagan and the women's team main coach being Craig Starcevich. In the week before a home game at The Gabba, the men's team will train there to prepare to play there later that week. The women's team will do the same when they occasionally play at The Gabba rather than Brighton Homes Arena. ==Club song== The club song, The Pride of Brisbane Town, is sung to the tune of the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The lyrics to the song are below. We are the pride of Brisbane Town, We wear maroon, blue and gold. We will always fight for victory, Like Fitzroy and Bears of old. All for one and one for all, We will answer to the call. Go Lions, Brisbane Lions, We'll kick the winning score You'll hear our mighty roar! ==Related pages== * Australian rules football in Queensland ==Other websites== * Official website Category:Australian rules football clubs in Queensland Category:Sports clubs and teams in Brisbane Category:1990s establishments in Australia",
