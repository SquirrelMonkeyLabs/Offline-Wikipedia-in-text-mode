 "text": "Counting the cost is the name of a pair of parables Jesus told. The two parables are written in the New Testament in Luke 14:25-33. ==What Jesus said== Large crowds were travelling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: ==What it means== The disciples of Jesus gave up everything they had for the kingdom of God, even their lives. To follow \"God's salvific aim\" meant to put family and possessions in second place.Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , pp. 566-567.Charles McCollough, The Art Of Parables: Reinterpreting the Teaching Stories of Jesus in Word and Scripture, Wood Lake Publishing, 2008, , pp. 94-95. Christians believe the cost of being a disciple is worth the promised rewards. ==References== Category:Parables of Jesus",
