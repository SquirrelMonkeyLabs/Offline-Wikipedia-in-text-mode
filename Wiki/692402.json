 "text": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy (CRP) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (because it involves the nerve roots). CIDP is closely related to Guillain–Barré syndrome and it is thought to be the chronic counterpart of that acute disease. Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy. Several variants have been reported. Specially important are: *An asymmetrical variant of CIDP is known as Lewis-Sumner Syndrome.http://www.cidpusa.org/LEWIS%20SUMMER.dwt *A variant with CNS involvement named combined central and peripheral demyelination (CCPD)Jun-ichi Kira, Ryo Yamasaki, Hidenori Ogata, Anti- neurofascin autoantibody and demyelination, Neurochemistry international, Dec. 2018, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2018.12.011 ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the nervous system",
