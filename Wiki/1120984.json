 "text": "Pendekar Bujang Lapok (English: The Three Over-age Bachelor Warriors) is a 1959 black-and-white comedy film from Singapore. Directed by P. Ramlee, it is the second film in the Bujang Lapok series and stars P. Ramlee, S. Shamsuddin, and Aziz Sattar. The film was shot at Jalan Ampas, Singapore. Pendekar Bujang Lapok features the same main characters, actors, and personalities as the earlier Bujang Lapok film, but it is not a sequel since it doesn't connect to the events of the first film. In October 2014, The Straits Times named it one of the top five Malay films made in Singapore. The film won Best Comedy at the 6th Asian Film Festival in 1959. ==Cast== * P.
