 "text": "The Okinawa green tree frog, Okinawa aogaeru, Amami aogaeru, Amami green tree frog, or green flying frog (Zhangixalus viridis) is a type of frog. It lives in Japan, in Okinawa. It lives on three islands, Okinawajima, Iheyajima, and Kumejima. The adult male frog is about 45-56 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 65-77 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is very green but it can be brown. There are disks on its toes for climbing. The belly is yellow or white in color. People have seen this frog in wetlands and paddy fields. People have seen this frog between 50 and 500 meters above sea level. The adult frog makes a bubble foam near the end of the water in a rice paddy, marsh, or other place with water. The male frog sometimes digs a hole for the eggs. When the eggs hatch, the foam turns into liquid. The liquid goes into the paddy or pool, and the tadpoles go with it. The tadpoles can be 40 mm or even 50 mm long. Tadpoles have a long tail with small spots on it. The young frogs are 17-19 mm long from nose to rear end. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
