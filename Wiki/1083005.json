She joined the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary congregation. She was assigned to teach elementary school and high school. She taught for 29 years. Keller earned her B.A. in Mathematical Sciences, and Master's Degree in mathematics at DePaul University. She went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and became the first woman to have a Ph.D. in computer science. She resumed teaching and took side classes all the while. She did graduate work at Purdue, the University of Michigan, and Dartmouth College. She became the first female staff member in their previously male-only computer science center and led it for 20 years. She also taught at Clarke University and established a masterâ€™s degree program for computer science there. Another one of her achievements was working on the development of the computer language BASIC. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:American computer scientists Category:1913 births Category:Year of death missing",
