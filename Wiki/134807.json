 "text": "The Thal desert is in Punjab, Pakistan. It is a large area mainly between the Jhelum River and Sindh rivers near the Pothohar Plateau. It has little vegetation — mostly thorny bushes — over a breadth of 70 miles. In Thal the people are very poor because the whole land is arid and depends upon the weather conditions. They cultivate grains only. It is the most illiterate area in Punjab Province. Noor Pur Thal has ten Union councils. Category:Deserts of Pakistan",
