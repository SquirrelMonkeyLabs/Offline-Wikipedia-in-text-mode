 "text": "The lacrimal bone is the smallest bone in the face; about the size of the little fingernail. It is at the front of the inside wall of the eye socket. The lacrimal bone is involved in crying. It is part of the tear duct, where tears drain from the eye. The lacrimal sac is where tears flow when you cry. The tears then go down a duct inside the nose. This is why you can get a runny nose from crying. Anatomy and Physiology Saladin, 7e 2015 ==More images== File:Lacrimal bone - animation.gif|Where the lacrimal bones are (shown in green).
