Minuchin developed structural family therapy, which talked about problems within a family by talking about the relationships between family members, or between subsets of family. When Minuchin moved to New York in 1981, he established the Family Studies Institute, where he could teach family therapists and interface directly with the foster care system through consultation services. Minuchin died of heart disease at a care facility in Boca Raton, Florida on October 29, 2017 at the age of 96.Salvador Minuchin, a Pioneer of Family Therapy, Dies at 96 - New York Times obituary ==References== ==Other websites== * The Minuchin Center * The Philadelphia Child and Family Therapy Training Center Category:1921 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Argentine scientists Category:American psychologists Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Argentine writers Category:Writers from New York City",
