In 1862, Boone was arrested and briefly held in Camp Douglas on suspicion that he had helped a Confederate prisoner to escape. Boone first ran for mayor of Chicago in 1855. He campaigned on a platform attacking Catholics and immigrants. After he was elected, he ordered the enforcement of a law against selling alcohol on Sundays -- but only in immigrant neighborhoods.
