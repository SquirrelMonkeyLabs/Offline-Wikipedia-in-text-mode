 "text": "Microsoft Visual C++ is a coding environment made by Microsoft, mainly used for coding in C and C++. The software provides helpful tools for programmers, such as a debugging tool to help find bugs in written code. The program is available in both trial and free versions. Some programs require the Visual C++ library package to be installed on the computer in order to run in the first place. The previous version of Visual C++ was called Microsoft C/C++, originally used to compile code written in C. The first version of Microsoft Visual C++ was officially released in February of 1993. The product was first created as an environment for C programming, however it only supported the original C library rather than the C99 revision. In 2013, Visual C++ included support for various C99 features, however it was not until 2015 that Visual C++ included full support of the C99 standard library. The C11 revision that replaced the C99 revision is still not supported in recent versions of Visual C++, however the company has plans to add them in future versions. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Building Win32 Applications Using Visual C++ 2005 Express * Visual C++ Tools and Templates in Visual Studio Editions * Visual C++ standalone build tools * Microsoft's 'Going Native' Channel Nine show * Rejuvenating the Microsoft C/C++ Compiler , September 2015 Category:Microsoft",
