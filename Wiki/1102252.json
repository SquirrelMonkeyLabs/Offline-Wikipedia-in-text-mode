 "text": "The Yugoslav Partisans were a resistance group during World War II. In 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by Nazi Germany and other axis powers. The territory was divided and annexed between the axis, but people resisted, and resistance groups were formed. One was called the Yugoslav Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito (a Yugoslav Communist of Croat and Sloven origin). In September 1944, the Soviets crossed the Yugoslav border to help the Partisans. They liberated the capital (Belgrade) the next month. By 1945, the Partisans were formed into a proper military (with 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th armies). They liberated the whole country in May 1945. == Notes and References == Category:History of Yugoslavia Category:20th century in Europe",
