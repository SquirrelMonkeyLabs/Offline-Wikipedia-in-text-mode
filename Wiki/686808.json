Smollett released his first extended play album, The Poisoned Hearts Club in 2012. Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California. Some sources say he was born in 1982. Others say he was born in 1983. ==In the justice system== Smollett was indicted on February 20, 2019, for disorderly conduct. Authorities have taken him to court, for an incident that is sometimes known as the 2019 hate crime hoax. He paid two men to attack him, and he filed a false police report. On March 26, 2019, Smollett's defense team reached a deal with prosecutors. They agreed to drop all charges. Smollett agreed to perform community service and lose the money he paid for his bail. In December 2021, Smollett was convicted of five felony counts of disorderly conduct, and he was sentenced in March 2022 to 150 days in county jail. The 150-day sentence is not final, yet (as of March 2023). ==References== Category:1982 births Category:African-American actors Category:African-American singers Category:American television actors Category:American movie actors Category:Singers from California Category:Actors from California Category:Living people Category:Criminals from California",
