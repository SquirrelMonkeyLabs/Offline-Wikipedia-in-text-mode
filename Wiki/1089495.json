 "text": "This is a list of countries sorted by income inequality metrics, such as Gini coefficients. The Gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1. If the number was 0, everyone in the country would be equal. If the number was 1, a country would be unequal, with one person having all the income. No country has a score of 0 or 1. ==OECD countries== ===Gini coefficient, before taxes and transfers=== Country Gini Year 0.441 2020 0.486 2019 0.489 2019 0.438 2020 0.495 2017 0.551 2021 0.432 2019 0.445 2019 0.465 2019 0.516 2020 0.519 2019 0.497 2019 0.525 2019 0.463 2019 0.369 2017 0.520 2018 0.449 2019 0.511 2018 0.501 2018 0.483 2020 0.495 2019 0.490 2019 0.435 2020 0.453 2020 0.454 2020 0.436 2020 0.452 2018 0.511 2019 0.383 2019 0.444 2019 0.405 2020 0.491 2019 0.433 2020 0.402 2019 0.502 2019 0.507 2020 0.517 2021 Source: Measure: Gini (market income, before taxes and transfers) ===Gini coefficient, after taxes and transfers=== Country Gini Year 0.318 2020 0.274 2019 0.262 2019 0.280 2020 0.460 2017 0.487 2021 0.248 2019 0.268 2019 0.305 2019 0.265 2020 0.292 2019 0.296 2019 0.308 2019 0.286 2019 0.250 2017 0.292 2018 0.342 2019 0.330 2018 0.334 2018 0.355 2020 0.357 2019 0.305 2019 0.420 2020 0.304 2020 0.320 2020 0.263 2020 0.281 2018 0.310 2019 0.222 2019 0.246 2019 0.331 2020 0.320 2019 0.276 2020 0.316 2019 0.415 2019 0.355 2020 0.375 2021 Source: Measure: Gini (disposable income, post taxes and transfers) ==Related pages== *Gini coefficient == References == Category:Lists of countries Category:Economics",
