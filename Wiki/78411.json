 "text": "Valencian (valencià) is the historical, traditional, and official name used in the Valencian Community (Spain) for the language spoken in this region, also known as Catalan (català) in the Spanish Autonomous Communities of Catalonia, Aragon and the Balearic Islands; in the country of Andorra; in the southern French region of the Roussillon; and in the Italian city of Alghero on the island of Sardinia. In linguistics \"Valencian\" is also used to identify this distinctive variant spoken in central and southern Valencia which has gained its own currency within the Catalan domain. == Language or dialect? == The official authorities, which are the government of the Valencian Community and the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, accept Valencian as a dialect of Catalan. The Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana and several associations disbelieve this opinion. They believe Valencian is a language in its own. They also accuse the official authorities of mixing Valencian with Catalan. This is done by approaching the Valencian ortography and grammar to the Catalan one. ==References== Category:Romance languages Category:Valencian Community Category:Languages of Spain",
