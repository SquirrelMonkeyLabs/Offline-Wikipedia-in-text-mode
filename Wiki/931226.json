 "text": "This is a list of Namibian Twenty20 International cricketers. In April 2018, the ICC decided to give full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Namibia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will have T20I status. This list has all members of the Namibia cricket team who have played at least one T20I match. It is arranged in the order in which each player won his first Twenty20 cap. Where more than one player won his first Twenty20 cap in the same match, those players are listed alphabetically by surname. Namibia played their first T20I match on 20 May 2019 against Ghana at the ICC T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier Finals. ==Key== General * – Captain * – Wicket-keeper * First – Year of debut * Last – Year of latest game * Mat – Number of matches played Batting * Runs – Runs scored in career * HS – Highest score * Avg – Runs scored per dismissal * * – Batsman remained not out * 100 – Centuries scored * 50 – Number of half centuries Bowling * Balls – Balls bowled in career * Wkt – Wickets taken in career * BBI – Best bowling in an innings * Ave – Average runs per wicket Fielding * Ca – Catches taken * St – Stumpings affected ==List of players== :Statistics are correct as of 22 May 2022.Players / Namibia / T20I caps – ESPNcricinfo.
