 "text": "Mahinda V was King of Anuradhapura in the 10th and 11th centuries. He was the last king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and the last from the House of Lambakanna II. In 993, Anuradhapura was invaded and captured by the Chola, under the command of Rajaraja Chola I. Mahinda V fled to Ruhuna, the southern part of the country. He was later taken prisoner and taken to India, where he died as a prisoner in 1029. The Mahavamsa records that the rule of Mahinda V was weak and he was unable to control Sri Lanka correctly. The country was powerless and his army refused to follow orders. ==References== Category:10th- century births Category:1029 deaths Category:Prisoners Category:Kings and Queens of Sri Lanka",
