 "text": "LuaLua TV is a Bahraini TV channel. It was broadcast in London and started broadcasting in 2011. It was blocked by all of the GCC countries including Bahrain. In June of 2021, the FBI took away LuaLua's domain along with other TV channels such as Press TV, due to the channels allegedly having links to Iran which violated US laws. However the website came back under a new domain. == References == Category:Arabic-language television stations",
