 "text": "Friday the 13th is a date that happens when the 13th day of a month falls on a Friday. Many people believe this day is unlucky. It can happen at least once a year, and sometimes up to three times in a single year. == Why is it Unlucky? == The idea of Friday the 13th being unlucky comes from a mix of two things: fear of the number 13 (called \"triskaidekaphobia\") and the belief that Fridays are unlucky. For example: * In Christian tradition, Jesus was crucified on a Friday. * The number 13 is often seen as unlucky because it is one more than 12, which is thought to be a \"complete\" number (like 12 months in a year or 12 hours on a clock). Some stories also connect the day to a tragic event, such as the arrest of the Knights Templar in France on Friday, October 13, 1307. However, this story may not be the real reason for the superstition. == How Often Does It Happen? == Friday the 13th happens at least once a year, but can happen up to three times in the same year. If the first day of a month is a Sunday, then the 13th of that month will be a Friday. Some years, like 2023 and 2024, have two Friday the 13ths, while others may have only one. == Occurrence == Friday the 13th is not as rare as some might think. It occurs at least once every year and can happen up to three times in a single year. The pattern is determined by the Gregorian calendar, which repeats every 400 years. Over this cycle, Friday the 13th happens about 688 times. === Frequency === The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July in either a leap year starting on Sunday (AG) or common year starting on Monday (G) to September the following year in a common year starting on Tuesday (F) (e.g. 2001–02, 2012–13 and 2018–19), or from August in a common year starting on Friday (C) to October the following year in a leap year starting on Saturday (BA) (e.g. 1999–2000 and 2027–28). The shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a common year starting on Thursday (D) (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026). Frequency within a single year There can only be up to three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March, and November in a common year starting on Thursday (such as 2009, 2015, or 2026) (D), or January, April, and July in a leap year starting on Sunday (such as 1984, 2012, or 2040) (AG). In the 1990s, there was one Friday the 13th in 1993, 1994, 1997 and 1999, two in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995 and 1996 and three in 1998 for a total of 17 Friday the 13ths in the 1990s. In the 2000s, there was one Friday the 13th in 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2008, two Friday the 13ths in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2007 and three Friday the 13ths in 2009 for a total of 17 Friday the 13ths. In the 2010s, there was one Friday the 13th in 2010, 2011, 2014 and 2016, two Friday the 13ths in 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and three Friday the 13ths in 2012 and 2015 for a total of 18 Friday the 13ths. In the 2020s, 2021 and 2022 each had one Friday the 13th and 2020 and 2023 had two. 2025, 2027 and 2028 will have one Friday the 13th, 2024 and 2029 will have two, and 2026 will have three, for a total of 16 Friday the 13ths in the 2020s. This information shows that the frequency of Friday the 13ths increased slightly between the 1990s and 2010s but will decrease again in the 2020s. == In Popular Culture == Friday the 13th is a famous theme in movies and stories. The \"Friday the 13th\" movie series, which began in 1980, is about a fictional killer named Jason Voorhees. These movies are well-known for being scary and are popular among fans of horror films. == What Do People Do on Friday the 13th? == * Some people avoid traveling or making big decisions because they think something bad might happen. * Others celebrate it as a fun or spooky day. For example, some tattoo shops offer special deals for Friday the 13th tattoos. == Similar Superstitions == Other cultures have their own unlucky days. For example: * In Spain and Greece, Tuesday the 13th is thought to be unlucky. === Tuesday the 13th === ==== 1. The Day \"Tuesday\" ==== * In Spanish, Tuesday is called \"Martes,\" named after Mars, the Roman god of war. Mars symbolizes conflict, destruction, and violence, which gives the day a sense of foreboding. * In Greek mythology, Tuesday is linked with Ares, the Greek equivalent of Mars, reinforcing associations with bad luck and chaos. ==== 2. The Number 13 ==== * Just like in other cultures, the number 13 is considered unlucky. It is often seen as irregular or incomplete compared to 12, which is considered a \"perfect\" number (e.g., 12 months, 12 zodiac signs, 12 apostles). * In Christian tradition, 13 is sometimes connected to the Last Supper, where Jesus dined with his 12 apostles before his betrayal and crucifixion. ==== 3. Historical Events ==== * Fall of Constantinople (1453): In Greek history, Tuesday is remembered as the day Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. This occurred on May 29, 1453, which was a Tuesday. The event was devastating for Greeks and is still considered an unlucky association with the day. ==== 4. Cultural Traditions ==== * In Spain, Greece, and Latin America, the combination of Tuesday and 13 intensifies bad omens because both the day and the number are seen as inauspicious on their own. Together, they are considered doubly unlucky. * In Italy, Friday the 17th is considered bad luck instead of Friday the 13th. ==== Friday the 17th ==== Friday the 17th is considered unlucky in Italy and some other parts of Southern Europe. This superstition has roots in religion, history, and the symbolism of the number 17 in Italian culture. While it might seem unusual compared to Friday the 13th in English-speaking countries, the reasons for the superstition are deeply embedded in Italian tradition. === Why Is the Number 17 Unlucky? === # Roman Numerals and Death #* In Roman numerals, the number 17 is written as XVII. #* When rearranged, it can form the word VIXI, which in Latin means \"I have lived\" (implying \"I am dead\"). #* This association with death and bad luck makes 17 an ominous number in Italian culture. # Biblical Connections #* According to some interpretations, the Great Flood described in the Bible began on the 17th day of the second month. This adds a layer of misfortune to the number in religious contexts. #* Friday itself has religious significance as the day of Jesus' crucifixion in Christian tradition, making the combination of Friday and 17 doubly unlucky. # Numerology #* In Italian numerology, 17 is often associated with imbalance or disruption. It is seen as less \"complete\" than numbers like 16 or 18, which symbolize harmony or success. === Why Friday? === * Friday has long been considered an unlucky day in Christian traditions because it is believed to be the day of Jesus' crucifixion. * The combination of Friday (a traditionally unlucky day) and 17 (an unlucky number in Italy) creates a day considered particularly inauspicious. === Superstitions Around Friday the 17th === * Many Italians avoid important activities on this day, such as traveling, getting married, or making big financial decisions. * Some airlines and hotels in Italy skip the number 17, much like the number 13 is skipped in English-speaking countries. * In Formula One racing, Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo once avoided using the number 17 on their cars. Friday the 13th is an interesting mix of myths, traditions, and popular culture. Whether you believe it is unlucky or not, it remains a curious part of human history. Category:Superstitious dates",
