 "text": "The WAGR F class were a total of 57 freight steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1902 to 1972. The F class were built by DÃ¼bs & Coy of Glasgow, Scotland and later its successor the North British Locomotive Coy from 1902 to 1913 as 4-8-0 locomotives for use on goods trains. Throughout their years of service, they were frequently fitted with experimental equipment. Superheating of the F class began in 1924 and continued up to 1948 - resulting in the Fs class, though when they were relegated to shunting duties in the 1950s they were rebuilt to normal saturated locomotives for economic reasons. Two of the F class are preserved, No. 398 (452) at Collie, and Fs class No. 460 (407) at Bassendean Railway Museum. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
