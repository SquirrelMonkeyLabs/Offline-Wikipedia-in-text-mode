The operation, which resulted in the dhow being sunk as well as two United States Navy SEALs going missing, took place in the Arabian Sea just off the coast of Somalia. ==Seizure== According to the United States military, U.S. Navy SEALs took off from the USS Lewis B. Puller, an Expeditionary Mobile Base (ESB) with the goal to seize control of an Iranian dhow, which was believed to be transporting supplies to the Houthis. The U.S. Navy SEALs were supported by U.S. military helicopters and UAVs. In the operation, the United States seized control of the vessel and captured parts for Iranian ballistic missile and cruise missiles. They also captured propulsion, guidance, and warheads used by the Houthis for medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles. During the operation, two U.S. Navy SEALs were lost at sea during the mission and the entire crew of the dhow were captured. After completing the seizure, the U.S. military deemed the dhow was “unsafe” and was sunk by the United States Navy. == Related pages == * List of military operations during 2024 ==References== Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Houthi Movement Category:January 2024 events Category:Red Sea crisis",
