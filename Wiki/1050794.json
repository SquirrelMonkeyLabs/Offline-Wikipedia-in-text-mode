 "text": "The 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup will be the 14th edition of the men's One Day International (ODI) team tournament, which is held every four years. It is being organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), and will be held in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia during October and November 2027. This will be the second tournament to be co-hosted by South Africa and Zimbabwe, following the 2003 edition, and the first to be co-hosted by Namibia. A total of 14 teams will take part, four more than in the previous edition. This is a deadlink which needs to be replaced. Australia will be the defending champions, having won the 2023 competition. ==Qualification== South Africa and Zimbabwe (co-hosts) along with the top eight teams in the ICC ODI rankings will qualify directly for the tournament, while the remaining four spots will be decided by the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Although Namibia will co- host the tournament for the first time in their history, they cannot qualify directly because they are not a full ICC member, and as a result they will have to compete in the pre-tournament qualifier.
