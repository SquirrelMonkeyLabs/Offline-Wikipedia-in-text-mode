It was formed in 1928 for mothers of those lost in World War I. The organization has a congressional charter under Title 36 ยง 211 of the United States Code. The name came from the custom of families of servicemen hanging a banner called a service flag in the windows of their homes. The flag had a star for each family member in the Armed Forces. Living members of the military were represented by a blue star. Those who died in combat were represented by a gold star. Membership in the organization is open to any woman who is a U.S. citizen or legal resident. They must have had a child die in active service in the U.S. military. The place or time of the military service does not matter. The circumstances of death do not matter either.Mothers of those missing in action can be a part of the organization. ==References== Category:Military of the United States Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States",
