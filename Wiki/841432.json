The egg custard is made of egg yolks, black pepper and parmesan and/or pecorino. == Origins == Some people claim that the name Carbonara comes from the black carbon look that the peppers give off. Others believe that the origins of Carbonara come from an old dish eaten by shepherds in Lazio. This dish was called cacio e ova. == Preparation == In traditional Italy, cream is not used (instead they use yolk), but in other countries, cream is applied to the pasta as it makes the dish more stable. == References == Category:Pasta Category:Italian food",
