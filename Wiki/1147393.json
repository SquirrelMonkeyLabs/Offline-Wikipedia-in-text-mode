Scientists saw the frog between 100 and 640 meters above sea level. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Parque Nacional Natural Farallones de Cali. ==Young== Scientists think the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Humans cut down the forests to make farms, to get wood to build with, and to make places for people to live. Some of the farms are against the law. Bad chemicals from farms, can also kill this frog ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
