 "text": "The Untersberg Arena is a football stadium in the Austrian town of Grödig in Salzburg. It is the home ground of SV Grödig. ==History== The facility was completed in 1989 under the name Sportanlage Grödig. With SV Grödig's promotion to the first league in the 2007/08 season, an adaptation became necessary. After the renovation work in 2008, the covered main stand had 310 seated places and also has 1,890 standing places. During the 2010/11 winter break, another stand for 755 spectators was built on the east side of the arena. After promotion to the Bundesliga, the arena was expanded in the summer of 2013. It offers space for 4,128 spectators. In addition to the main playing field, the stadium has a training field suitable for competitions and an artificial turf field. There are 1,100 car parking spaces and 13 bus parking spaces available at the stadium. On February 18, 2015, the Bundesliga's licensing committee withdrew approval for games in the top division for the future because the pitch was unplayable. A new pitch made of natural grass with associated pitch heating was installed. Senate 3 of the Austrian Football Bundesliga examined the newly laid grass area in the stadium on March 9, 2015. The club was able to immediately return to its home ground. In the 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons, FC Liefering played as a tenant in the stadium, and the UEFA Youth League home games of FC Red Bull Salzburg (FC Liverpool, SSC Napoli, KRC Genk and Derby County) also took place in the Untersbergarena.
