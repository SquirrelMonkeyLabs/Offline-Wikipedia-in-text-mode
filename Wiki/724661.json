 "text": "Acetone peroxide (also called APEX) is a very explosive and dangerous chemical compound. It is often seen as a dimer or trimer. This means that the molecules of acetone peroxide are connected to each other two or three times. Acetone peroxide is very explosive and can explode if it is exposed to a flame. == Usage == Acetone peroxide does not see much use in armies around the world, because it does not last very long. It only lasts around 10 days. However, it is very popular among terrorist groups, because it is cheap to make and very energetic. It is also one of the few explosives that do not contain nitrogen, making it hard to find. The chemical compound can be produced by mixing distilled acetone (commonly found in nail polish removers and paint thinners), concentrated hydrogen peroxide, and acid catalyst (can be found in drain cleaners), then mixing the acetone and hydrogen peroxide in a 1:1 ratio, then by slowly mixing the acid catalyst in, then filtering the precipitate out of the chemical compound and washing the precipitate, and lastly let the acetone peroxide dry in a cool, dark place.
