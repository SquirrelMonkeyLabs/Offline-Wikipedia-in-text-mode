 "text": "Primal Scream are a Scottish rock band originally formed in 1982 in Glasgow by Bobby Gillespie (vocals) and Jim Beattie. The band's current band members are Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Martin Duffy (keyboards), Simone Butler (bass), and Darrin Mooney (drums). Primal Scream had been performing live from 1982 to 1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band were a key part of the mid-1980s indie pop scene. They later made psychedelic and garage rock music, before using a dance music element to their sound with their 1991 album Screamadelica. Their latest album Chaosmosis was released on 18 March 2016. ==Discography== *Sonic Flower Groove (1987) *Primal Scream (1989) *Screamadelica (1991) *Give Out But Don't Give Up (1994) *Vanishing Point (1997) *XTRMNTR (2000) *Evil Heat (2002) *Riot City Blues (2006) *Beautiful Future (2008) *More Light (2013) *Chaosmosis (2016) ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Scottish musical groups",
