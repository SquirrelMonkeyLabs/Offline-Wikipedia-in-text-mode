 "text": "Parasailing is a sport. Parasailers are put into a harness that is attached to a parachute. They hold on to a rope and are towed at high speeds behind a vehicle (usually a boat, but sometimes a truck on land). The parachute helps them rise up into the air behind the vehicle. People parasail for the thrill and also to get a good, high view of the scenery around them. Parasailing is a popular recreational activity that was developed in the 1960s. Dangers include falling too fast while in the air with injuries upon landing. Category:Sports for the disabled",
