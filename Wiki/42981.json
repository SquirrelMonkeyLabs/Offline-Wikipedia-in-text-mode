 "text": "Loki (, often Anglicized as ) is a god in Norse mythology. Loki is the son of Fárbauti and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr. Loki is married to Sigyn. They have a son, Narfi and/or Nari. Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr. While in the form of a horse, Loki was impregnated by Svaðilfari and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Loki is referred to as the father of Váli in Prose Edda. This source also refers to Odin as the father of Váli twice and Váli is only said to be a son of Loki once. Loki's relation with the gods varies by source. Loki sometimes helps the gods and sometimes behaves badly towards them. Loki can change his shape. He has appeared in the form of a salmon, a mare, a fly, and possibly an old woman named Þökk . Loki's good relations with the gods end with his role in causing the death of the god Baldr. During Ragnarök, Loki is said to fight against the gods among the forces of the jötnar. He will fight the god Heimdallr, and they two will kill each other. Loki is talked about in the Poetic Edda, the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, the Norwegian Rune Poems, in the poetry of skalds and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be shown on the Snaptun Stone, the Kirkby Stephen Stone, and the Gosforth Cross. Scholars disagree about Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology. Some have described him as a trickster god. ==Other media== Loki has been used in many different forms of media in modern popular culture. Most notable of this is his use in Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Hiddleston has played Loki in the movies Thor, Thor: The Dark World, Thor: Ragnarok, The Avengers and Avengers: Endgame. He also played versions of Loki in the TV series Loki on Disney+.
