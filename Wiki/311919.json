The Norwegian Crusade was next, from 1107 to 1110. King Sigurd I led the crusade.Riley-Smith, 1986, p. 132 Sigurd was the first European king to go on crusade to the Holy Land. He did not lose any battles. The Norwegian crusade seems to have been similar to earlier Viking raids. ==References== ===Other reading=== * * (Old Norse: ) ===Notes=== Category:History of Norway Category:Crusades Category:1100s Category:1110",
