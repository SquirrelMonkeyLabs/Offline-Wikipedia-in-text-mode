 "text": "The Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway (DNSR) was a cross-country railway running northâ€“south between Didcot, Newbury and Winchester in England. The line opened in stages between 1882 and 1885. Owing to lack of money, it never reached Southampton, so trains from Winchester to Southampton went by another route. The line closed between 1960 and 1962 and some sections have become cycle routes. There are plans to build a cafe, the \"Handlebar Cafe\", on the cycle route near Winchester. ==References== Category:Closed railway lines in South East England",
