 "text": "Andrew Roy Gibb (5 March 1958 – 10 March 1988) was an English singer popular in the 1970s. He was the younger brother of Barry (born 1946), Maurice (1949–2003) and Robin Gibb (1949–2012), The Bee Gees. He was born in Manchester, but spent most of his childhood in Queensland. He died in Oxford of myocarditis (a heart problem) caused by an infection, shortly after his 30th birthday. While his years of alcohol and cocaine abuse were not the direct cause of death, they certainly did not help his condition. == References == == Other websites == * Category:1958 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Deaths from myocarditis Category:English pop musicians Category:English singers Category:Infectious disease deaths in England Category:Musicians from Manchester",
