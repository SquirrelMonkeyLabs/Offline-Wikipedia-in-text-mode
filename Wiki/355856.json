 "text": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called electroshock, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are caused by electricity in unconscious patients to treat illness. The process is completed by placing electrodes on the sides of the patient's head (on either both or just one side) and sending a small electric current through the brain. This lasts for about half a second. The patient is also made unconscious before the treatment for safety reasons. The therapy without informed consent is medical abuse and Article 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles prohibit to \"care\" any sexual orientation and gender identity though any therapy including this. == Related pages == *MindFreedom International Category:Psychiatry Category:Controversies Category:Medical procedures",
