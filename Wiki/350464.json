Charlotte was the daughter of the Prince Regent (later George IV of the United Kingdom). But they didn't have any children because the marriage only lasted for 1 year. Here's why: On 3 November 1817, when the Princess’s labour began, she was particularly overdue and a long and difficult delivery resulted in the birth of a still-born son two days later. After the birth Princess Charlotte initially appeared to recover, but due to complications she died five hours later in the early hours of 6 November. ==References== Category:1790 births Category:1865 deaths Category:Monarchs of Belgium Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece",
