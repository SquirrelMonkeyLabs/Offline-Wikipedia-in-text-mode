Makoun is married and has four children, including Jean III Makoun, who followed his footstep to be a footballer. In April 2011, Makoun was given a compassionate leave by Aston Villa to return to Cameroon after his wife and one of his children were involved in a car crash. In addition to speaking French, Makoun also speaks English, learning the language from his time at Villa Park. In March 2012, he was fined for parking illegally from his time at Olympiacos. ==Honours== Lille * UEFA Intertoto Cup: 2004 Olympiacos * Super League Greece: 2011–12 * Greek Cup: 2011–12 Cameroon * Africa Cup of Nations runner-up: 2008 ==References== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Cameroonian footballers Category:People from Yaoundé",
