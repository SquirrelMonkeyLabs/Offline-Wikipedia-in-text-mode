 "text": "The Canadian National Exhibition is an annual fair that happens in Toronto. It is the largest annual fair in Canada, and the sixth largest in North America, with 1.5 million visitors each year. The fair started in 1879 and has happened every year except during World War I and World War II when the fairground was used instead by the Canadian Army to train soldiers. It also did not happen in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fair is held in the last two weeks of August and the first few days of September and ends on Labour Day. At the fair, people can see shows and exhibits, demonstrations of new technology, farm animals, and they can also enjoy rides such as roller coasters and play games. ==References== Category:1878 establishments in Canada Category:Exhibitions Category:Toronto Category:Festivals in Canada",
