 "text": "The Harmonia Macrocosmica is a star atlas by Andreas Cellarius. It was published in 1660 by Johannes Janssonius. The first part of the atlas has copper plate prints showing the universe models of Claudius Ptolemy, Nicolaus Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. In the second part are star maps of the Christian constellations. The atlas also had plates supporting the views of the Catholic Church, so the book was not placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a list of publications the Catholic Church censored. == References == ==Other websites== Category:17th-century books Category:Astronomy Category:Science books Category:1660s works",
