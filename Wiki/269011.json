The club started in July 1859, and had played continuously since then, which makes it the second oldest club in any code, in the world. The club was an original member of the Victorian Football Association which formed in 1877. It left the association with a number of other clubs to form the Victorian Football League in 1897. It is now a member of the Australian Football League. ==Club song== We are Geelong, the greatest team of all We are Geelong, we're always on the ball We play the game as it should be played At home or far away Our banners fly high, from dawn to dark Down at Kardinia Park So! Stand up and fight, remember our tradition Stand up and fight, it's always our ambition Throughout the game to fight with all our might Because we're the mighty blue and white And when the ball is bounced, to the final bell Stand up and fight like hell. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Geelong Football Club website Category:Australian rules football clubs in Victoria Category:Geelong",
