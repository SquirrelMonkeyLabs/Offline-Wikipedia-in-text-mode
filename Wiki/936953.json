 "text": "Vikidia is a free online encyclopedia based on wiki, content has a general theme adapted for children, and is open to the participation of people of all ages. One of the users who joined Wikipedia, Mathias Damour (registered under the name Astirmays), differed in that the texts should be corrected before being published instead of being created and edited by the children themselves, not believing that they would see a closing agreement in the aforementioned discussion. That is why on November 17, 2006, autonomously and independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, the Vikidia wiki was launched. As of December 2022, Vikidia has articles in French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Armenian, Greek, Catalan, Basque, and Sicilian. For example, the section in French contains 37.1 thousand articles, in English – 4.2 thousand articles, in Russian – a few hundred. ==References== Category:Wikis Category:MediaWiki websites",
