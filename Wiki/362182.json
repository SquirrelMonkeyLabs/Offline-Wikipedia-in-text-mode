He was known for his roles as Jed Clampett in The Beverly Hillbillies and as Barnaby Jones in Barnaby Jones. Ebsen was the oldest voice guest star in television history with his voice role as Chet Elderson in King of the Hill. Ebsen was originally cast to play the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. However, Ray Bolger, who was playing the Tin Man, convinced Ebsen to trade roles for a rehearsal. Ebsen had a very bad allergic reaction to the aluminum dust in the Tin Man's makeup.

He was later married to Nancy Wolcott from 1944 until they divorced in 1985. Ebsen was last married to Dorothy Knott from 1985 until his death in 2003.
