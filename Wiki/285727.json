It is the fourth biggest city in Kansas. ==History== ===19th century=== Olathe was created by Dr. John T. Barton in Spring 1857. He came to the center of Johnson County, Kansas. He later told about his ride to friends: \"...the prairie was covered with verbena and other wild flowers. I kept thinking the land was beautiful and that I should name the town Beautiful.\" Purportedly, Barton asked a Shawnee interpreter how to say \"Beautiful\" in his native language. The interpreter responded, \"Olathe.\" Olathe was incorporated in 1857. It was not the first city in Johnson County. Because it grew very quickly, it became the county seat in October 1859. Growing hatred across the United States about the issue of slavery led to many fights between abolitionist settlers and nearby slave state Missouri. These fights would grow, and they would become a part of the bigger fight known as Bleeding Kansas. When Kansas became a state in 1861, it was a free state. When it became a state, violence stopped. Peace, however, would continue to elude Olathe for many years to come. In 1861 Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city. It had one company of soldiers, and it had the local militia. On September 6, 1862, William Quantrill led guerrilla Confederate soldiers in an attack against Olathe. A half dozen people died, and most of the city was destroyed. Quantrill captured the outpost, and he tried forcing the men to fight for the Confederacy.William E. Connelley, Quantrill and the Border Wars (Cedar Rapids, Iowa: Torch Press, 1909), pp. 234, 271.

Noble, letter, The War of the Rebellion, Series II, Vol. IV, pp. 721-2. Kansas militia continued to stay in the Olathe military post for the rest of the Civil War. Confederate soldiers would try to attack Olathe two more times. The first time happened on August 20–21, 1863 as Quantrill was going through on his way to Lawrence, Kansas (see Lawrence Massacre). The second raid happened on October 24-5, 1864, when Confederate Major General Sterling Price with 10,000 men went through on their retreat South (see Price's Raid).Connelley, pp. 397-8.First Lieut.
