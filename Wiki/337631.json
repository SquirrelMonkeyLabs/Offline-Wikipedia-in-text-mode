Maharaja Umaid Singhji got Umaid Bhawan Palace built in Jodhpur at the time of famine so as to provide employment to public. Its ruler, the Maharaja of Jodhpur, expressed a wish to join Pakistan but Lord Mountbatten warned him that his subjects were mostly Hindus and his accession to Pakistan would create problems.
