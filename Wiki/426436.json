Mathews made his debut in 2009 and played 119 Test matches, scoring 8,167 runs at an average of 44.62, with 16 centuries. Sri Lanka's Test calendar for 2025 consists of only four matches—two against Australia and two against Bangladesh. Mathews expressed concern over the declining focus on Test cricket in the country. Additionally, Sri Lanka did not qualify for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, with the top eight ODI teams securing places. The qualified teams include Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. Sri Lanka is set to host Bangladesh from 17 June to 16 July 2025 for a full series comprising two Tests, three ODIs, and three T20Is. The Test matches will be part of the 2025–2027 ICC World Test Championship cycle.
