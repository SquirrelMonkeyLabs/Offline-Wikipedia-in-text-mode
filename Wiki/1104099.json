 "text": "Apollonius of Pergaeus (, c. 262 BC – c 190 BC) was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician, well-known for his works related to conics . His innovative methods and terminology, especially in the field of conics, influenced many later scholars including Ptolemaeus, Francesco Maurolico, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, and René Descartes. Apollonius gave the terms of ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola as we use today. The hypothesis of eccentric orbits used to explain the apparent orbits of the planets and the rate of change of the Moon, or Apollonius's Theorem, was his discovery, later described by Ptolemaeus in volume XII.1 of Almagest. Apollonius also studied the Moon. A crater on the Moon was named after him. == Reference == * * Apollonius. Apollonii Pergaei quae Graece exstant cum commentariis antiquis. Edited by I. L.
