 "text": "\"Why Socialism?\" is an article written by Albert Einstein in May 1949 that appeared in the first issue of the socialist journal Monthly Review. It showed problems with capitalism, economic competition, and an increasing wealth inequality. It talks about control of mass media by private capitalists making it difficult for citizens to be truthfully informed, and political parties being influenced by rich backers. Einstein said that these problems can only be corrected with planned economy which keeps a strong democracy to protect the rights of individuals. ==References== Category:Socialism Category:Albert Einstein Category:1949 establishments",
