 "text": "The Pacific Coast League (PCL) is a Minor League Baseball league based in the Western United States. Like the International League, the PCL plays at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball (MLB). The league started in 1903 and was a popular baseball league in the region until 1958 when MLB teams moved there and MLB games began to be shown on television. It was named the Pacific Coast League because it started with only teams from the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, which are next to the Pacific Ocean. After MLB took control of Minor League Baseball in 2021, it was called the Triple-A West for one season before going back to the PCL name in 2022. ==Teams== Division Team Founded MLB affiliation Affiliated since City Stadium East Albuquerque Isotopes 2003 Colorado Rockies 2015 Albuquerque, New Mexico Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park El Paso Chihuahuas 2014 San Diego Padres 2014 El Paso, Texas Southwest University Park Oklahoma City Dodgers 1962 Los Angeles Dodgers 2015 Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark Round Rock Express 2000 Texas Rangers 2021 Round Rock, Texas Dell Diamond Sugar Land Space Cowboys 2012 Houston Astros 2021 Sugar Land, Texas Constellation Field West Las Vegas Aviators 1983 Oakland Athletics 2019 Las Vegas, Nevada Las Vegas Ballpark Reno Aces 2009 Arizona Diamondbacks 2009 Reno, Nevada Greater Nevada Field Sacramento River Cats 2000 San Francisco Giants 2015 Sacramento, California Sutter Health Park Salt Lake Bees 1994 Los Angeles Angels 2001 Salt Lake City, Utah Smith's Ballpark Tacoma Rainiers 1960 Seattle Mariners 1995 Tacoma, Washington Cheney Stadium ==References== ==Other websites== *Minor League Baseball's official website Category:Baseball leagues",
