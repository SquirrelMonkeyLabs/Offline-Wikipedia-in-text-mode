 "text": "Vera Clinic is a healthcare institution based in Istanbul, Turkey, specializing in hair transplant and cosmetic surgery. == History == Vera Clinic was founded in 2013 as Estevera, a specialized hair transplant clinic that primarily served the local Turkish market. In 2015, the clinic was rebranded, changing its name to Vera Clinic and focusing on expansion and health tourism. In 2017, Vera Clinic became the first clinic worldwide to utilize sapphire blades in hair transplant surgeries. In 2020, the clinic introduced OxyCure, its proprietary brand, which employs oxygen-infused technologies to accelerate healing, reduce inflammation, and improve the quality of the scalp and transplanted hair. The following year, Vera Clinic received a European Award in Medicine for Hair Transplant Surgery. The company started using stem cell technology in hair transplants and offers Regenera Activa, a treatment that extracts and processes regenerative cells from the patient's scalp to stimulate new hair growth. == References == Category:Companies of Turkey",
