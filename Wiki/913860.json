The term is used to refer to the Desert Fathers, monks who went to live an ascetic lifestyle in the desert, about a century earlier. Notable examples were Syncletica of Alexandria, Theodora of Alexandria, Sarah of the Desert, Melania the Elder, Melania the Younger, Olympias the Deaconess, and Eustochium.
