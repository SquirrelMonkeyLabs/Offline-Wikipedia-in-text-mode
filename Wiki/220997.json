 "text": "is a Japanese girl group. They are what is known as an \"idol group\", although they have distanced themselves from the \"idol\" stereotype. Most of their songs are happy songs with upbeat music, but they have sad and angry songs too. The group can also be called . They are the most important group in the Hello! Project company. The group is managed by Tsunku, who writes all the lyrics and most of the music the songs, and even produces them. They were the best- selling female group in Japan for several years, but their sales dropped quite a lot later on, perhaps due to the loss of certain popular members, or because of decisions made by Tsunku or someone else at Hello! Project or their management company Up-Front Works. In the past couple of years, however, they have regained some of their popularity in Japan, and they have also gained more foreign fans. == History == In late 1997, in Japan, a male singer- songwriter called Tsunku, held a contest to find a girl to be the lead singer of the band Sharam Q, which he was the frontman of. A lot of young girls came to the contest, and some of them became finalists. There is where Tsunku came up with the idea of making a girl group. This new group was called Morning Musume (Morning Daughters). The group was formed by Kaori Iida, Yuko Nakazawa, Asuka Fukuda, Aya Ishiguro and Natsumi Abe. They became known as the \"First Generation\" of the group. There have now been twelve of these \"Generations\". Most of these \"Generations\" have a few members. But the Third, Seventh, Twelfth and Sixteenth Generations only had one member each. From the start, the songs performed by these girls sold well. They became very famous in Japan (their fame later reached other countries too, thanks to their fans on the World Wide Web), and Tsunku formed other small groups inspired by Morning Musume. He created Hello!Project to hold them all. Over time, when the girls become older and mature, they usually graduate from the group (but they can be kicked out for not behaving in the way that idols are supposed to behave). After that, they usually become soloists or models. New girls apply for a spot in the group whenever auditions are held. Thousands of girls apply, but very few make it in. == Members == === Current members=== Name Birth date Age Join date Generation Member colour* Position Notes Erina Ikuta July 7, 1997 27 January 2, 2011 9 Yellow Green Leader, vocalist, lead dancer, lead rapper Former child model Sakura Oda March 12, 1999 25 September 14, 2012 11 Lavender Sub Leader, Main vocalist, lead dancer Former member of Hello!
