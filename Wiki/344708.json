 "text": "The following is a list of current National Football League stadiums, sorted by how many people it holds, their locations, their first year of usage and home teams. ==Shared stadiums== As of the current 2021 season, two sets of teams share a stadium—the New York Giants and New York Jets with MetLife Stadium, and the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams with SoFi Stadium—meaning there are only 30 full-time NFL stadiums. The Steelers share a stadium with Pitt (college team). The Miami Dolphins share a stadium with the Miami Hurricanes (college team). The Las Vegas Raiders share a publicly owned stadium with UNLV (college team) as co-tenants. ==NFL at overseas== The NFL uses several other stadiums on a regular basis in addition to the teams' designated regular home sites. The Jacksonville Jaguars currently have an agreement to play at least one regular-season home game per year at Wembley Stadium in London, England, as part of the NFL International Series through 2020. Another London venue, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, is also a regular International Series host. ==Pro Football Hall of Fame Game== Fawcett Stadium in Canton, Ohio, is the location of the annual exhibition Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. ==Capacity== The New York Giants and New York Jets' MetLife Stadium is the largest stadium in the NFL by its regular seating capacity. The Dallas Cowboys' AT&T; Stadium can expand past that of MetLife Stadium by means of using standing-room and temporary seating, which makes AT&T; Stadium currently the only NFL stadium capable of holding 100,000 or more spectators, though it normally only seats 80,000. With the opening of SoFi Stadium, the smallest NFL stadium is Soldier Field, home to the Chicago Bears. ==List== Stadiums are listed by their seating capacity for NFL games. Some stadiums can be expanded to fit larger crowds for other events such as concerts or conventions.
