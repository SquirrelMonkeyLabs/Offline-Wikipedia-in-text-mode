 "text": "The Big Four was a name used to describe the four largest railway companies in the United Kingdom in the period 1923â€“47. The name was coined by The Railway Magazine in its issue of February 1923: \"The Big Four of the New Railway Era\". The Big Four were: * Great Western Railway (GWR) * London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) * London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) * Southern Railway (SR) The companies were formed as a result of the Railways Act 1921, in a process known as \"The Grouping\" (of the railways), which came into effect on 1 January 1923. On 1 January 1948, the companies were nationalised to form British Railways as a result of the Transport Act 1947. ==Related pages== * List of railway companies involved in the 1923 Grouping Category:Big Four (British railway companies)",
