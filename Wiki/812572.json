 "text": "An election was held on November 3, 2020 to elect a Senator from the U.S. state of Arkansas. The main people in the election were Tom Cotton (Republican Party) and Ricky Dale Harrington Jr. (Libertarian Party). This election was strange because there was no person from the Democratic Party in the election. This was because the only person in their primary election, Josh Mahony, withdrew and it was too late for anyone else to be in the primary. Only Cotton was in the Republican Party's primary election. ==Results== ==References== Category:2020 United States Senate elections Category:Arkansas",
