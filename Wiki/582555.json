 "text": "Giric was king of the Picts from 878-889. He died around c. 890, showing he may have been deposed or personally abdicated. He ruled with Eochaid, a disputed king of the Picts who claimed the throne during the whole of Giric's reign. He succeeded Donald Áed, after murdering him in 878. == Birth == Giric may have been born in c. 832 but this is widely considered theory and not taken as fact, the exact date of Giric is unknown but was definitely after 812. == Reign == In 878 Giric murdered king Áed, making him the king of the Picts/Scots. He was the 2nd last king of the Picts/Scots along with Eochaid who ruled with him during his entire reign, he claimed the throne after Áed's death as he was king of Strathclyde and may have been named successor by Áed during 877-878. == Eochaid == Eochaid was a claimant and had a disputed reign, he was born around c. 860, making him nearly 30 years younger than Giric, since Giric was born in c. 832 (according to sources), Eochaid may have murdered Giric to try and take the throne himself. == Abdication/Deposition == Giric may have abdicated in 889 or have been deposed. It is known that when Giric stopped ruling that Eochaid may have also stopped ruling as records show him dying after 889 and Eochaid's rule also ended in 889. == Death == In 890 Giric died in Scotland. Not much is known about his death as he did not rule at the time and Donald II took the throne after his abdication or deposition. ==References== Category:Kings and Queens of Scotland Category:9th-century births Category:890 deaths Category:9th century in Scotland",
