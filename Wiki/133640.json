 "text": "Rosh Hashanah (, literally \"head of the year,\" Biblical: , Israeli: , Yiddish: ) is a Jewish holiday commonly referred to as the \"Jewish New Year.\" It is observed on the first day of Tishrei, the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. The festival lasts for two days. Rosh Hashanah is the first of the High Holidays or Yamim Noraim (), or Asseret Yemei Teshuva (The Ten Days of Repentance) which are days specifically set aside to focus on repentance that conclude with the holiday of Yom Kippur. The story of Rosh Hashanah is about Abraham and his belief in God when he was told to sacrifice his son. It is customary to send \"A Good and Happy Year\" greetings on Rosh Hashanah to family and friends. == Years == Jewish year and Gregorian year: * 5778 = 2017-2018 * 5779 = 2018-2019 * 5780 = 2019-2020 * 5781 = 2020-2021 * 5782 = 2021-2022 ==References== * Category:Jewish festivals and holidays",
