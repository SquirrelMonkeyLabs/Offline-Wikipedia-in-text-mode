 "text": "The Heidelberg Tavern massacre occurred in Observatory, Cape Town on 30 December 1993. Three people associated with the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) entered the tavern and shot at the crowd. They killed four students and the owner of a restaurant which was close. The owner had gone outside to investigate, because he had heard gunshots. An unexploded bomb (with nails strapped to it) was found in the restaurant, close to the main entrance. == Massacre == During the years of apartheid, Observatory was one of the few de facto \"grey\" suburbs where all races lived together. On the evening of 30 December 1993, three men entered a popular student venue on Station Road, called the Heidelberg Tavern and opened fire, killing four people and injuring five. The three APLA operatives - Humphrey Luyanda Gqomfa, Vuyisile Brian Madasi and Zola Prince Mabala - were convicted in November 1994 for what became known as the Heidelberg Massacre. On 16 July 1998, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission granted the three amnesty. ==References== Category:Attacks on bars Category:Mass murder in 1993 Category:Apartheid- related violence Category:1990s in South Africa",
