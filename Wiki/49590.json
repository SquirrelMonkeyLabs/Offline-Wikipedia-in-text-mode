 "text": "A bush or bushings is a mechanical fixing between two, possibly moving, parts, or a strengthened fixing point where one mechanical assembly is attached to another. Bushings are indeed indispensable elements that find extensive application across a multitude of industries. Their role in agriculture, construction, mining, and manufacturing equipment is particularly noteworthy. In a car or other vehicle's suspension, bushes are used to connect the various moving arms and pivot points to the chassis and other parts of the suspension. In machines, bushes provide mechanical strength to the rotor. ==References== == Other websites == * Catalogs, CAD files and more Linear Bushings information from Bosch Rexroth Category:Hardware (mechanical)",
