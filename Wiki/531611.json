 "text": "Abdul Hamid II (21 September 1842 â€“ 10 February 1918) was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He was the last sultan to have complete control over the Empire. He was responsible of the Hamidian massacres. Killing between 100.000 - 300.000 Armenians. He witnessed many revolutions and wars. Abdul Hamid II ruled from 1876, until he was overthrown by a group of people calling themselves the \"Young Turks\" in 1909. Abdul Hamid II was the last ruler who nearly had total authority. Meaning that his authority was hardly limited by policies or reforms such as a constitution. == Rule == He modernized the Ottoman Empire during his reign. Railways, schools and hospitals were built under his rule. He also seeked to unify the Muslims in the Empire under Pan- Islamism. Others had tried to unify people in the Empire under Ottomanism (identity based on shared belonging to the Ottoman Empire). Sultan Abdul Hamid II was the one who authorized the building of the Hamidiye Mosque, which was finished in 1886. The Mosque was built near the Yildiz Palace, and its decoration style combines the classical Ottoman with Neo-Gothic. It became a symbol for the ruler's authority. His reign ended as Young Turks revolted against him. In 1909, being persona non grata, he was forced to abdicate in favor of his brother, who became Sultan Muhammad V. Abdul Hamid II spent his last years under house arrest at the Beylerbeyi Palace in Istanbul, where he died in 1918. ==References== Category:Sultans of the Ottoman Empire Category:1842 births Category:1918 deaths Category:People from Istanbul",
