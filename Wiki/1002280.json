Luke Cage first appeared in Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #1 (June 1972) and was created by Archie Goodwin, George Tuska, Roy Thomas, and John Romita Sr. He was the first black superhero to be featured as the protagonist and title character of a comic book. He obtained his powers in an accident in Seagate Prison that left him with near impervious skin and superhuman strength. After legally changing his name, Cage decided to become a \"hero for hire\" where he would help anyone he came across, but at the cost of a money fee. He would soon take the moniker \"Power Man\" and became a full-fledged superhero, and became the partner of Iron Fist, Misty Knight, Colleen Wing, Victor Alvarez, and Jessica Jones (his later wife). He is a well known member of the Defenders and the Manhattan Defenders, and was a member of the Secret Avengers, New Avengers, Secret Defenders, Fantastic Four, Marvel Knights, Heroes for Hire, and the Dark Avengers. == In other media == Since his debut in the comics, the character has appeared in numerous media, such as in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he was portrayed by Mike Colter. == Source == * Some text was copied from Luke Cage at Superheroes Wiki, which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license.
