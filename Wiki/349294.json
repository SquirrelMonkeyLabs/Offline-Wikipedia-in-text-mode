 "text": "A hole-in-one in golf is when a player hits the ball from the tee and into the hole in one shot. It is most possible on a par-3 hole. Some people have done it on shorter par-4 holes. Nearly all par 4 and par 5 holes are too long for golfers to reach in a single shot. Getting the ball in the hole in two shots is called an albatross. Category:Golf Category:Sports words",
