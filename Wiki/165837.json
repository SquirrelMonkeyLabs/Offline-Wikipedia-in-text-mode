 "text": "The Baker Street & Waterloo line, otherwise known as simply the Baker & Waterloo line or Bakerloo line (), is a line of the London Underground. It is coloured brown on the Tube map. It runs partly on the surface and partly at deep level, from Elephant & Castle in south-east to Wealdstone in north-west of London. The lines serves 25 stations of which 15 are underground. The line is around long. The line gets its name because it goes through the stations Baker Street tube station and Waterloo tube station. North of Queens Park, the line runs next to the West Coast Main Line. == Stations == Note: For the former Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, see the Jubilee line article.

The project was to start at the late 1940s, but they cancelled it for an unknown reason. Then in the 21st century, they revised the extension plan and proposed it again. So far, nothing has been agreed. The 1940s version of the extension had two stations. One rumour of why they cancelled the project was because Camberwell was quite a bad location to do further extensions. ==Former Stations== ===Watford Branch=== Between 1917 and 1982, Bakerloo line trains continued along the DC line past Harrow & Wealdstone to Watford Junction.
