 "text": "The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), developed by the IETF and created in 1998 as RFC 2326, is a protocol for use in streaming media systems, which allows a client to remotely control a streaming media server, issuing VCR-like commands such as \"play\" and \"pause\", and allowing time-based access to files on a server. The sending of streaming data itself is not part of the RTSP protocol. Most RTSP servers use the standards-based RTP as the transport protocol for the actual audio/video data. The RTSP server from RealNetworks also features RealNetworks' proprietary RDT as the transport protocol. ==Clients== * GStreamer * Media Player Classic * MPEG4IP * MPlayer * QuickTime * Avi player * RealPlayer * Skype * VLC media player * Winamp * Windows Media Player * Xine * MythTV via Freebox * Gom player ==Server software== * QuickTime Streaming Server: Apple's closed-source streaming server that ships with Mac OS X Server * Darwin Streaming Server: Open-sourced version of Quicktime Streaming Server maintained by Apple * pvServer: Formerly called PacketVideo Streaming Server, this is Alcatel-Lucent's streaming server product. * Helix DNA Server: RealNetworks' streaming server.
