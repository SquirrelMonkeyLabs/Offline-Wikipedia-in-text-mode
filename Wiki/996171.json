In this year they also won the Mitropacup. In 1934 Graf left Austria and played for Wiener Sport-Club until 1942. ==National team== In May 1928 Graf made his debut for the national team when Yugoslavia was defeated 3-0 in Vienna. The second and last match in the national team followed in July 1932 versus Sweden because the competition on his position was high at that time.
