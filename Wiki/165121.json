In 1919, William Wrigley, Jr., who sold chewing gum, bought the island. When he died he gave it to a trust. The island has many plants and animals that live nowhere else on Earth. According to the National Resources Defense Council, Avalon Beach is one of the dirtiest beaches in the United States. ==Other websites== * Catalina Island Museum for Island History * The Catalina Island Conservancy * USC Wrigley Institute * Santa Catalina Island Interpretive Center * Collectors of Catalina Island Pottery & Tile Category:Islands of the United States Category:Geography of Los Angeles Category:Landforms of California",
