 "text": "Alfred Barye \"Le Fils\" or Alf Barye (Paris, France, 21 January 1839 – Paris, France, 1882) was a French sculptor of the Belle Époque. He was a student of his father, the artist Antoine-Louis Barye. In cooperation with Émile Guillemin, Barye did the artwork for \"The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback\". Other works of his were animal bronzes as well as Oriental subjects. At his father's request, he signed his work as \"fils\" to differentiate his work from his father's. As was his father Antoine-Louis Barye, Alfred Barye became Ferdinand Philippe d'Orléans favorite sculptor, and later the quasi-official sculptor of Napoleon III. He signed many of his sculptural works as Barye or A. Barye, the same signature used by his father. This has caused as much confusion today as it did during his lifetime, and many of Alfred’s models are mistakenly attributed to and sold as his father’s works. After much family disagreement and at the insistence of his father, he began signing his work as Alf. Barye, and later A. Barye Fils. It has been suggested, but never confirmed, that Alfred Barye was responsible for quite a few unauthorized lifetime casts of his father’s works. Many works mistakenly attributed to Antoine-Louis Barye are actually by his brilliant son, Alfred Barye. The young Alfred worked for a long time in his father's studio; while he conceived and created the works himself, his father appropriated them by signing them with the name Antoine-Louis Barye and preventing his son from using the Barye signature. Growing up, Alfred began to rebel against the violence of Antoine- Louis Barye. Father and son did not speak to each other for several years. The Barye rebellion finds a symbolic moment in Alfred’s artistic collaboration with another son of art, Émile Guillemin, with whom he formed a strong friendship and mutual esteem. == Museum == Barye's bronzes are now in many museums' collections: * Louvre Museum, Paris * Musée d'Orsay, Paris * Brooklyn Museum, New York City * Fogg Museum, Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts * Busch–Reisinger Museum, Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts * Arthur M.
