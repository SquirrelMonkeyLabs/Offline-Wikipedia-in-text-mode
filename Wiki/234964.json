 "text": "The 1960 United States presidential election happened on November 8, 1960. This election was between Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon, of which Kennedy slimly won. Incumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower was not allowed to run again due to serving two terms. This was the first presidential election in American history in which both candidates debated against each other on television. On television, Kennedy appeared rested and calm while Nixon appeared sick and unconfident. More television viewers thought that Kennedy won the debate, while more radio listeners thought that Nixon won the debate. This election was the last to not count District of Columbia as an electoral vote until the 1964 election. Senator John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for president on January 2, 1960. Vice President Richard Nixon announced his candidacy on January 9, 1960. This was the last election where Ohio voted for the losing candidate until 2020. ==Candidates== ===Democratic Party=== Democratic candidates * John F.
