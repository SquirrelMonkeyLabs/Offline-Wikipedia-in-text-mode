She was viewed as a child progidy, due to her talent at such a young age. She won many of the national competitions in South Korea. At age 13, Chung and her family moved to the United States to further her musical education. Later Chung would study under Joseph Szigeti in Europe. Chung began performing in concert halls in the U.S. such as with the New York Philharmonic and Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She substituted for violinists Itzhak Perlman and Nathan Milstein, which were significant opportunities.
