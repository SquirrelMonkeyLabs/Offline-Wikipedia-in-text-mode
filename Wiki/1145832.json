 "text": "The United States presidential election of 1856 saw the election of James Buchanan, a Democrat. It was a three-way race, with the major candidates being James Buchanan, John C. Fremont (Republican), and Millard Fillmore (Know- Nothing.) James Buchanan's vice-president was John C. Breckenridge. Slavery was a major issue in the election, with the democrats being largely for it, the republicans being largely against it, and the know-nothings were divided on the issue. This was the election before the 1860 presidential election, which Abraham Lincoln won. James Buchanan (cropped).jpg|James Buchanan John Charles Fremont crop.jpg|John C.
