He was considered one of the typical Church Fathers in terms of eloquence. Being classically trained philosopher and preacher, he infused Hellenism into the early Church and was well-known among Byzantine prelates and theologians. Gregory had an crucial impact on the model of Trinitarian theology, for both Greek and Latin church. Many of his theological works still continue to influence theologians today, especially on the issue of the relationship between Trinity. Gregory was venerated in both Eastern and Western Christianity. Together with Basil the Great and Gregory of Nyssa, he was known as the Fathers of Cappadocia . In Roman Catholicism, he was considered as Doctor of the Church. Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism honored him as one of Three Holy Hierarchs along with Basil the Great and John Chrysostom. == References == Category:Doctors of the Church Category:Theologians Category:Christian saints",
