It is a two- seated convertible with a removable hardtop. It has a 4.7 L V12 engine that was based on the 3.5 L V12 used in the 1992 Ferrari F92A Formula One car. Only 349 Ferrari F50's were made. This was because Ferrari wanted it to be rare. The last F50 was produced in Maranello, Italy in July 1997. It was made in 5 different colors: red, dark red, yellow, black and silver. The Ferrari F50 can reach a top speed of 205 miles per hour. Category:Ferrari",
