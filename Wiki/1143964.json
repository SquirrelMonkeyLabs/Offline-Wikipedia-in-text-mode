 "text": "John XXIII (c. 1365 – 22 December 1419), born Baldassare Cossa, was an antipope during the Western Schism. He served as antipope from 1410 to 1415. == Early life == Baldassare Cossa was born in Naples, Italy, around 1365. He came from a noble family and pursued a career in the church. He studied law at the University of Bologna and later became a cardinal under Pope Boniface IX. == Western Schism == The Western Schism (1378–1417) was a period when the Catholic Church was divided, with multiple popes claiming authority. In 1410, after the death of Antipope Alexander V, Baldassare Cossa was elected as pope by a group of cardinals who supported the Pisan line during the schism. He took the name John XXIII. == Council of Constance == The schism was causing great division in the church, so in 1414 the Council of Constance was called to end it. John XXIII attended the council but was pressured to resign in 1415 to help reunify the church. After resigning, he was imprisoned for a time by the council. == Later life and death == After his resignation, John XXIII was eventually released and spent his remaining years in Florence. He died on 22 December 1419. == References == == Other websites == * Catholic Hierarchy: Baldassare Cardinal Cossa Category:Antipopes Category:1360s births Category:1419 deaths Category:Italian cardinals Category:Italian popes",
