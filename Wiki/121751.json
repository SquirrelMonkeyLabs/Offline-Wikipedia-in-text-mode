 "text": "Promotion and relegation are terms used in many sports. Being promoted means moving up a league to one of a higher status. This usually happens when a team wins their league. Relegation normally happens to the team(s) at the bottom of the league at the end of the competition. They are moved down a league to one of a lower status. For example: *Team A wins the league and is promoted from the Second Division to the First Division. *Team B finishes last in the First Division and is relegated to the Second Division.
