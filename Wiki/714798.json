 "text": "The Boone's Lick Road or Boonslick Trail was an early 1800s transportation route. It went from eastern to central Missouri in the United States. It went east-west on the North side. It went along the Missouri River. The trail started in the river port of St. Charles. The trail was important in the westward expansion of the United States and the development of Missouri becoming a state. The trail ended at Franklin. Franklin was the start of the better-known Santa Fe Trail. First mapped by the sons of Daniel Boone, the path ended at a salt lick in Howard County used by the pair to manufacture salt. Today the lick is maintained as Boone's Lick State Historic Site. Towns created along the trail include Franklin, Smithton, Columbia, Fulton, Williamsburg, and Warrenton and others. ==References== ==Other websites== *Boone's Lick Road Association *Boonslick Historical Society Category:History of Missouri",
