Despite their families' pleas, the French government refused to bring them home. In January 2023, the UN condemned France for this decision, following previous condemnations in 2022. The only hope for these children lies with their families in France, who are demanding their repatriation. In the spring of 2023, over a hundred French children remain in dire conditions in Syrian camps, their future uncertain. All this is happening while concerns grow about Daesh's resurgence in the region. ==Distinction== *2023 : Mention of the Jury at Justice Documentary Festival ParisEric HancokThe oldest film festival on French Justice was relaunched this year on NewsBreak.com *2023 : Albert Londres Prize == References == Category:French documentary movies Category:2020s documentary movies Category:2023 movies",
