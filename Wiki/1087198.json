 "text": "The Java Indonesian tree frog or pearly tree frog (Nyctixalus margaritifer) is a frog. It lives in Java, Indonesia. People have seen it between 700 and 1200 meters above sea level. People have seen it between 50 and 1800 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down but people have also seen it in coffee farms. It lives in places where the tree branches come together like a roof. The female frog lays eggs in bits of water high up in the trees. The water is in holes in the trees. The tadpoles swim and grow in the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people cutting down its forests may harm it. Some of the places where the frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
