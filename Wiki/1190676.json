The GCB is a member of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), which represents several Caribbean nations in the International Cricket Council (ICC). Guyanans play internationally for the West Indies. The team has been active since 1865. It was originally called Demerara, and then British Guiana, before it became Guyana in 1966. Home matches are played at the Providence Stadium. The team formerly played at the Bourda, in Georgetown. ==References== Category:First-class cricket teams in the West Indies Category:National sports teams of Guyana",
