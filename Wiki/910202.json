 "text": "Niloy Chatterjee (also known as Niloy Chakroborty, and by his pen name Niloy Neel), was a Bangladeshi secular blogger and atheist activist. He was a popular blogger in the Bangladeshi atheist blogging community. He was an organizer of the Science and Rationalist Association Bangladesh, and received his master's degree in Philosophy from Dhaka University in 2013. Niloy was a writer of the Mukto-Mona, a blogging platform for secularists and freethinkers, and was associated with the Shahbag Movement. == Murder == Chatterjee was killed on 7 August 2015. A group of about six men armed with machetes attacked him at his home in the Goran neighborhood of Dhaka, and hacked him to death. Police told that the attackers had tricked his wife to allow them into Chatterjee's home before killing him. His best friend Sahedul Sahed said that Neel had previously reported to the police that he feared for his life, but no action had been taken. Ansarullah Al Islam Bangladesh, an Al Qaeda group, claimed responsibility for Niloy's killing. ==Investigation== The United Nations asked for a quick and fair investigation of the murder saying, \"It is vital to ensure the identification of those responsible for this and the previous horrendous crimes, as well as those who may have masterminded the attacks.\" Amnesty International condemned the killing and said that it was the \"urgent duty (of the government) to make clear that no more attacks like this will be tolerated\". Other entities condemning the killing include the German Government, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Human Rights Watch, the Communist Party of Bangladesh, Gonojagoron Moncho, and other political parties of Bangladesh, both rightist and leftist. ==Responses== Writer Taslima Nasrin criticized the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and her government saying, \"Sheikh Hasina's government is morally culpable. I am squarely blaming the state for these massacres in installment. Its indifference and so-called inability to rein in the murderous Ansarullah brigade is solely predicated on the fear of being labelled atheists.\" == References == Category:Bangladeshi bloggers Category:Assassinated Bangladeshi activists Category:2015 deaths Category:Atheists",
