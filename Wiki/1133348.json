 "text": "Christina Saj /saɪ/ (Ukrainian: Христина Сай) (born 1967 in Syracuse NY) is a Ukrainian American artist living and working in New Jersey. She is best known for her paintings bridging traditional Byzantine iconography and contemporary art. She has created icons in the modern vernacular, that are neither pastiche, nor nostalgic reference, but rather as meant religious symbol. == Biography == Christina Saj is a first generation American, whose family emigrated to the US after WWII from Ternopil, Ukraine. Saj grew up in Montclair, NJ where she returned after completing her undergraduate and graduate studies. == Education and Early Career == Saj earned a BA in Fine Art in 1988 from Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville NY, followed by an MFA in Painting from the Milton Avery Graduate School for the Arts at Bard College, Annandale on Hudson in 1992, she also studied Byzantine Art History at Wadham College, Oxford University, and spent time at SACI in Florence, Italy. Early in her career she learned traditional techniques of icon painting using egg tempera (a medium that employs pure pigment ground with an emulsion of egg and water) on a ground of levkas, while studying precepts of Byzantine Iconography with Petro Cholodny the Younger, whose icons can be found in Lourdes, Rome and in NY. Despite traditional training, Saj has often used found or unconventional materials in her work such as wood, metal, glass, collage elements and mixed media. Her works are based on traditional prototypes and therefore can be recognized as venerable objects of worship. In her 1997 solo exhibition “Remembering Myth” Saj explored the realization that all cultures search for spiritual meaning and thus began to pursue universal symbols with broad spiritual concepts. == Style and Technique == Saj is a prolific artist who is equally comfortable producing intimate work and large scale painting in an architectural context. In her 1997 solo exhibition “Remembering Myth” Saj explored the realization that all cultures search for spiritual meaning and thus began to pursue universal symbols with broad spiritual concepts. Saj’s work features strong compositions, an ambitious palette that takes delight in decorative effects and ornamentation. Her two-dimensional works merge representation with abstraction to create mystical spaces. She imbues the work with influences from traditional folk art, Ukrainian embroidery patterns, pysanka designs, and traditional religious iconography. A 1991 series made with industrial metal screens reduced her subjects to the purest geometric forms using subtle changes in texture and color to achieve definition. When exhibiting these works, Saj sometimes offered a traditional illustration and/or a biblical reference alongside it. == Exhibitions and Collections == Saj’s work has been exhibited at venues as The Ukrainian Museum, Union Theological Seminary, The Marian Library at University of Dayton, Museum of Biblical Art (NYC), The National Cathedral, (DC) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine (NYC), The Museum of Cultural Heritage (Kiev, Ukraine), Andrey Sheptytskky The National Museum in (Lviv, Ukraine), and the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art in Chicago. The Arts and Emhassies Program selected her Tree of Life series for the Qatar Embassy in Doha, Qatar. In 2019 the Ukrainian Museum in NYC invited Saj to do a public engagement installation project for them. REcreate, an installation consisting of 12 large panels with moveable parts invited museum goers to co-create works by reassembling removable pieces with the artist. The magnetized paintings turned passive viewers into co-creators, encouraging them to think about composition the way artists do. Participants posted their creations with the hashtag #RecreateAtUM which turned their artworks into an online exhibition on Instagram. In 2021, The Ukrainian Museum exhibited the Saj’s response to COVID-19 titled Finding Sanctuary During the Pandemic, a collection of paintings on vinyl records that lined a wall in the lobby and an adjacent gallery to dramatic effect: The circular forms provided a sacred space at a stressful time to demonstrate that even amid the chaos, there is beauty, and there is art. == Publications == Saj’s work has been published in the New England Review, WovenTale Press, Our Life Magazine, The Christian Century, and CIVA: Voices, ad Liturgical Press. == Curatorial Work == Saj was the Founder and Director of ARTspace 129 a gallery in Montclair NJ (2004-2007). She curated and presented six exhibitions of regional artists annually. == Residencies == In 2022 she was awarded a residency at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts in New York City. ResIn 2008, as part of a residency Saj created an installation of the Six Days of Creation at New Brunswick Theological Seminary which was installed in the sanctuary on the New Brunswick campus. == Selected Solo Exhibitions == * Lucky Charms, Talisman of a former life 81 Leonard Gallery, NYC 2023 * Finding Sanctuary: Painting thru the Pandemic, Ukrainian Museum, NYC 2022 * Sacred Space: Art as Sanctuary, First Presbytarian Church, Ann Arbor MI 2022 * Longing For What Belongs to Us FreshAirMontclair, 73 See Gallery, Montclair NJ 2020 * Sacred Space: Art as Sanctuary, First Presbytarian Church, Ann Arbor MI 2022 * Longing For What Belongs to Us FreshAirMontclair, 73 See Gallery, Montclair NJ 2020 * RE:create – Christina Saj’s Transformative Paintings, Ukrainian Museum, NYC 2019 * Cruciform, Central Presbyterian Church, Atlanta GA 2014 * Let the Angels Sing! 5th Avenue Presbyterian, New York, NY 2012 * Chorus of Angels, Christ Church Episcopal, Glen Ridge NJ | 2011 * Angels, Shepherds and Kings Central Presbyterian Church, Atlanta GA 2011 * On a Wing and A Prayer, Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, GA 2011 * Images of Faith, Grantham Church, Grantham, PA 2010 * Form Seeking Expression, Marian Library, University of Dayton, Dayton OH 2010 * The Six Days of Creation, New Brunswick Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, NJ 2008(39) * Visions and Imaginings, artpsace 129, Montclair, NJ 2006 * Lisova Pisnia, Ukrainian Education Cultural Center Gallery, Philadelphia PA 2004 * The Tree of Life, American Embassy, Doha, Qatar thru 2006 * Words and images, works on paper The Rosalind & Alfred Lippman Gallery, Temple B’nai Jeshurun Short Hills, NJ 2003 * Indomitable Spirit: Paintings of Faith, Hope and Remembrance, The Interchurch Center NY, NY 2001 * The Guiding Spirit, The Bible Technologies Conference, Chantilly, VA 2000 * The Corporate Landscape, Brodsky Gallery, Chauncey Conference Center, Princeton, NJ2000 * Painted Prayers, St. James Chapel, Union Theological Seminary, Columbia University, NY, NY 2000 * Drawing on Inspiration, Midland Gallery; Montclair, NJ 1999 * Music as Art/Art as Music, Central Presbyterian Church, Montclair, NJ 1999 * Celebration of Faith, Central Presbyterian Church, Montclair, NJ 1997 * Remembering Myth, Midland Gallery; Montclair, NJ 1997 * Allegories, The Lobby Gallery, Deutsche Bank, New York, NY 1995-06 * Saints, Kings and Prophets, The Lobby Gallery, Deutsche Bank, New York, NY 1995 * Contemporary Icons, Norbert Considine Gallery, Stuart Country Day School, Princeton, NJ 1994 * New Painting, Ukrainian Canadian Art Foundation, Toronto, Canada 1993 == References == == Other websites == * Christina Saj official Website * Ghosts of Byzantium Literature and Medicine Johns Hopkins University Press * Rachel Nicholl’s Walking on Water Category:American artists Category:1967 births Category:Living people",
