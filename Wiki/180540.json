 "text": "A supercontinent is a large area of land which has more than one continental core, or craton. They are formed by continental plates coming together. Continental plates have periodically collided and assembled in periods of orogeny (mountain-building) to form supercontinents. The cycle of supercontinents forming, breaking up, separating, and re-forming through plate tectonics happens about every 2000 million years. Eurasia is certainly a supercontinent, but the Americas are usually thought of as separate continents. Even more clearly, Gondwana and Laurasia were supercontinents formed by the breakup of the global supercontinent Pangaea. The land bridge between North and South America is geologically a rather temporary connection. Because of this, the Americas are usually not described as one supercontinent. == Ancient supercontinents == Throughout Earth's history, there have been many supercontinents. In order of age (oldest to newest), the ancient supercontinents were: Supercontinent name Age (Ma) Period/Era Range Comment Vaalbara 3,636–2,803 Eoarchean-Mesoarchean Also known as a supercraton or just a continent Ur 2,803–2,408 Mesoarchean-Siderian Known as both a continent and a supercontinent Kenorland 2,720–2,114 Neoarchean-Rhyacian The continents may have also formed into two groupings Superia and Sclavia Arctica 2,114–1,995 Rhyacian-Orosirian Not generally known as a supercontinent, depending on definition Atlantica 1,991–1,124 Orosirian-Stenian Not generally known as a supercontinent, depending on definition Columbia (Nuna) 1,820–1,350 Orosirian- Ectasian Rodinia 1,130–750 Stenian-Tonian Pannotia 633–573 Ediacaran Gondwana 550–175 Ediacaran-Jurassic From the Carboniferous, formed part of Pangaea, not always known as a supercontinent Pangaea 336–175 Carboniferous- Jurassic == References == Continents",
