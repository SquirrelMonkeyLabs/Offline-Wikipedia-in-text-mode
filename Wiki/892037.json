 "text": "A canopy or forest canopy is part of a tree, forest, group of trees, or group of other tall plants. It is where the leaves spread out like a roof or umbrella. The canopy is where the most sunlight touches the plants, so it is where the most energy enters living things. It is also where the most gas exchange happens, where oxygen and carbon dioxide and water vapor go in and out of the leaves. Many animals live in the canopy. == References == Category:Trees Category:Habitats",
