She was educated in Chad's capital city of N'Djamena. She spent her holidays with the indigenous Mbororo people. These people are traditionally nomadic farmers, herding and tending cattle. During her educational courses, she got aware of the discrimination against an indigenous woman. She discovered that her Mbororo people were excluded from the educational opportunities. In 1999, she founded the \"Association of Indigenous Peul Women and Peoples of Chad\" (AFPAT). It was a community-based organization. It promoted the rights of girls and women in the Mbororo community. It inspired leadership and works in environmental protection. The organization received its operating permission in 2005. Since then, it participated in international negotiations on climate, sustainable development, biodiversity and environmental protection. == Bibliography == * == References == Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:BBC 100 Women",
