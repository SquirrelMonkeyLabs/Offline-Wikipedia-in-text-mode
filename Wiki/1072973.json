 "text": "Lovis Corinth (21 July 1858 â€“ 17 July 1925) was a German painter and printmaker. His work evolved from impressionism to expressionism. He was a member of the Berlin Secession group, and later was the group's president. He started as a naturalist painter, later becoming an impressionist. Corinth was at first opposed to expressionism, but after a stroke in 1911, he adopted many expressionistic qualities. This is seen in his use of more vibrant colours and of distortions.
