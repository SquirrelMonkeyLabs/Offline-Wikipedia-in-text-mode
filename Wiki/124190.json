XXVIII (1936); pp. 421424 (Latin \"Among the many consolations\"). == Mission == Although it reports directly to the Pontiff, the academy has considerable freedom in conducting its mission: the study of Science and the possible consequences for the human condition. Christian belief is not a prerequisite for membership to the academy, because first and foremost, it is a legitimate Scientific body that follows the Scientific Method. As of 2003 more than two dozen Nobel Prize winners (including Professor Ahmed Zewail, Chemistry 1999) and several Field Medal winners were counted as members.The Four-Hundredth Anniversary of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (2003); pp 116-117 Plenary sessions are interdisciplinary events held every other year to review new developments and discus progress made towards their mission. Common working groups include astronomy and cosmology, cognition and brain science, and genetics.The Four- Hundredth Anniversary of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (2003); pp 118 == Reorganization == * In multis solaciis, issued 28 October 1936 by Pope Pius XI, on the topic of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. == References == == Other websites == * Libreria Editrice Vaticana (1936): In multis solaciis * The Pontifical Academy of Sciences official website Category:Christian colleges and universities Category:1603 establishments",
