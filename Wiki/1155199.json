 "text": "The Emperor of Russia, also known as the Tsar, was the ruler of the Russian Empire. This title was used from the 16th century until the monarch was abolished in 1917. The Tsar had absolute power over the government, military, and religion in Russia. The position was usually passed down from father to son within royal families. The Tsars were considered to be divinely appointed and often ruled with strong authority, although some, like Peter the Great, made reforms to modernize Russia. The last emperor was Tsar Nicholas II. He abdicated from the throne in 1917 after Russia's defeat in World War I and following the Russian Revolution. His reign ended the Russian Empire and the Romanov dynasty's 300-year rule of Russia. == List of emperors == == References == Category:Russian Empire Category:Imperialism Category:Emperors and Empresses of Russia",
