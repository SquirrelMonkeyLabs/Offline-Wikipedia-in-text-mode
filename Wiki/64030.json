 "text": "Kilometres per hour (km/h or km·h−1) is a unit of measurement for speed or velocity. ==Definition== By definition, an object travelling at a speed of one km/h in a straight line for one hour moves one kilometre. The unit is the most commonly used unit of speed worldwide, more common than the SI unit of speed, metres per second (m/s or ms-1). ==Conversions== * 3.6 km/h ≡ 1 m/s, the SI unit of speed, metre per second * 1 km/h ≈ 0.277 78 m/s * 1 km/h ≈ 0.621 37 mph ≈ 0.911 34 feet per second * 1 knot ≡ 1.852 km/h (exactly) * 1 mile = 1.609344 km (~1.61 km) * n km/h ≈ (1.61 * n) mph (where n is a quantity of speed in km/h) * 1 mph = ~1.6 km/h ==Related pages== * Kinematics Category:Physics Category:Units of velocity",
