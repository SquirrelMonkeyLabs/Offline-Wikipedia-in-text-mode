 "text": "The Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen was one of the Ernestine duchies. The dukes were never very important in forming the history of Europe, and unlike their relative in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha never set out to form a long lasting dynasty. Like all of the German monarchies the duchy became part of the Weimar Republic after World War I. In the reshuffle of Ernestine territories after the death of the Saxe-Gothaducal line in 1825, Saxe- Meiningen got the territories of Hildburghausen and Saalfeld. The state of Saxe-Meiningen was merged into the new state of Thuringia in 1920. The capital of Saxe-Meiningen was Meiningen; it had an area of 2,468 km² and a population of 269,000 (1905). The summer residence was Altenstein.
