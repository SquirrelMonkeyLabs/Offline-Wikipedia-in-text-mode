 "text": "Dichromacy is a condition where an organism has two different types of functioning photoreceptors, which are called cone cells, and are contained in the eyes. Organisms with this condition are called dichromats. Dichromats only need two primary colors to see color. Dichromacy in humans is a form of color blindness due to one of the three cone cells not being inside of the eye or one of the cone cells being dysfunctional. == References == Category:Vision",
