 "text": "Electronic rock is a music genre that is a combination of rock music and electronic music. It has instruments often found in both genres. It started in late 1960s, when rock bands such as The Doors, Pink Floyd, Yes, and The Moody Blues started using the Moog synthesizer into their music. Sampling and tape manipulation would also become common with the genre. Electronic rock acts usually combine things from other music styles, including punk rock, industrial rock, hip hop, techno, and synthpop. It has helped create subgenres such as indietronica, dance-punk, and electroclash. Since the late 2000s, electronic rock has become more popular. ==References== Category:Electronic music Category:Rock music Category:Fusion music genres",
