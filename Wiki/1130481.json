 "text": "Angry Birds (sometimes called Angry Birds Classic) is a removed popular puzzle video game. It was first released for iOS devices on December 11, 2009. The game was developed by Rovio Entertainment, and would create a media franchise of the same name after it got really popular. It has a simple story: the pigs stole the birds' eggs, so the birds try to get them back. The game was available for lots of mobile devices and video game consoles and supported by Rovio with many free updates that add more features and levels. This was until mid-2019 when the game (along with many other old Angry Birds games released before Angry Birds Transformers) were removed from app stores. A remake made in Unity called Rovio Classics: Angry Birds was released on iOS and Android devices on March 31, 2022. In February 2023, it was removed again on Android and renamed to Red's First Flight on iOS. ==Gameplay== In every level, the player uses a slingshot to launch the birds at the pigs that are in buildings made of blocks. Each level gives the player a line of birds; the bird sitting on the slingshot is launched when the player pulls the bird back. The bird behind it jumps up, and it is the next bird to be launched. When a bird is launched, it can hit the buildings and make the blocks break. This can make the pigs fall and disappear. The bird can also hit the pig itself to destroy it. The player has to destroy all the pigs in the map to unlock another level. After winning a level, the player can earn one to three golden stars as a ranking depending on their score. Points can be earned by damaging blocks, defeating pigs, and having some birds left-over. ==Development== Rovio made 51 games before Angry Birds, but none of them were successful. They were about to go bankrupt in 2009, so designer Jaakko Iisalo pitched a drawing of cartoony wingless birds jumping at a tower of blocks. Using those characters and basing the physics-based gameplay on an Adobe Flash game called Crush the Castle, Angry Birds was made. The game wouldn't be popular until it became a featured app on the iOS App Store in the United Kingdom. ==Release== The first version of this game was released in December 2009 for Apple Inc.'s mobile operating system iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) and the Nokia N900. The iOS release was a huge success not long after it came out, so Rovio decided to make versions for other mobile platforms (Maemo, webOS, Android, Symbian, Series 40 and Windows Phone). They also made versions even for computer operating systems (Mac OS, Windows) and gaming consoles (PlayStation, Xbox 360). There is also a version for Google's social network Google Plus. Other versions include Angry Birds Free with Magic, a special edition of the game for Nokia; for more levels, players have to use NFC. ==Reception== {{Video game reviews | MC = iOS: 80/100 iOS (HD): 81/100 PSP: 77/100 | GameZone = iOS: 8.0/10 | IGN = iOS: 8.0/10 PSP: 7.5/10 Android: 8.0/10 | MW = iOS: | OPMUK = PSP: 90/100 | PG = iOS: 8.0/10 | TA = iOS: }} From December 2009 to November 2011, people downloaded more than 500 million copies of this game.
