He was accused of abusing boys at two boarding schools many years earlier, St. George's School and Royal Hospital School. The accusation said he watched boys take showers and then touched a boy. He was put on trial. Warr told the court the accusations were \"malicious lies\". The trial lasted seven days. The members of the jury talked to each other for 40 minutes and then decided he was not guilty. Near the end of his life, Warr said that being accused of child abuse was worse than being diagnosed with cancer. ==References== Category:People acquitted of sex crimes Category:Radio personalities Category:1953 births Category:2020 deaths",
