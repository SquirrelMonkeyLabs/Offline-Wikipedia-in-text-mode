 "text": "Princess Daisy (sometimes called Daisy) is a character from the Mario video games series. She first appeared in the Game Boy launch title Super Mario Land as the princess of Sarasaland, and is the secondary female character of the Mario series. She has a tomboyish personality and has often been paired with Luigi. ==Appearances== In her first appearance, Daisy had pale skin, long, orange hair, a red crown and a white pattern on her dress. Her appearance in the NES Open Tournament Golf is more or less the same, aside from her hair now being more of an auburn color. In later games, such as Mario Tennis and Mario Party 3, her appearance was changed, giving her a rounder face, a slightly darker skin tone, and a daisy-motif for her accessories, with flower jewels appearing on her crown, earrings and brooch. The daisy-motif has stuck ever since, though it should be noted that the daisy-motif was seen in her concept art for Super Mario Land. In Mario Party 4, Daisy's character design was altered yet again, giving her shorter hair, a new dress design, and once again a paler skin tone. Nowadays, Daisy no longer has pale skin. Instead it is now more of a pink tone. Princess Daisy and Princess Peach also have different gloves; while Peach's gloves end at around mid-triceps, Daisy's gloves end at the wrists. Daisy is equal in height to Peach, though she sometimes appear shorter in certain games. In her early game appearances, Daisy wore a red crown, and during some of the Nintendo 64 games she wore a pink crown. Nowadays, she wears a gold one, the same as Peach. In most of her game appearances, Daisy has worn a yellow and/or orange color scheme, usually in the form of a collared dress, with white and orange accents, meant to match that of Peach's pink-themed fashion just as Luigi's outfit does to Mario's. In Mario sports titles, Daisy and Peach are the only two characters to always wear different outfits from their regular ones. She is usually depicted in her orange underwear with a yellow shirt and daisy accessories and her pants down which are called white socks. In Super Mario Strikers, Daisy wears a two-piece outfit. In Mario Hoops 3-on-3, Daisy normally appears in her usual sports outfit but has a second unlockable costume. In Mario Strikers Charged, she pretty much looks the same as in Super Mario Strikers, but she has cover herself up with armor plating along with other characters, leaving a quarter of her leg and her lower torso exposed. ===Movie adaptation=== Princess Daisy appears as one of the main characters in the Super Mario Bros. movie. She is played by Samantha Mathis. Mario's (Bob Hoskins) younger brother Luigi (John Leguizamo) falls in love archaeologist Daisy. She is kidnapped by the Koopa Cousins, Iggy and Spike, and taken to the another dimension called Dinohattan, a land where dinosaurs evolved to become the main species. Dinohattan is ruled by President Koopa (Dennis Hopper), who took over Daisy's father by transforming him into a fungus using a de-evolution gun. Daisy had a piece of meteorite that could be used to merge Dinohattan and Manhattan so Koopa could take over the human world. After the Mario Bros. defeat Koopa, Daisy stays behind in Dinohattan to help her restored father. The movie ends with Daisy showing up at Mario and Luigi's apartment to alert them that there is a problem, setting up a never-made sequel. ==Playable appearances== # Mario Tennis (2000) # Mario Party 3 (2000) # Mario Party 4 (2002) # Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour (2003) # Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
