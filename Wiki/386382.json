 "text": "Mohammad Aminul Islam () (born February 2, 1968 in Dacca) is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He played 13 tests for Bangladesh. He also played 39 ODIs. He scored the first hundred for Bangladesh. He, along with other senior players like Minhajul Abedin Nannu and Akram Khan, took Bangladesh towards Test status. He scored a scintillating 145 against India in their inaugural test, showing all the world of his class, and made the 2nd Bangladeshi test 50 after Habibul Bashar had reached his own. However, Bulbul, as he was affectionately called, lost his form afterwards and only managed to cross 50 twice more in Test mattches. Now he works for ICC, aiming to develop cricket in countries where it isn't a big sport, like China for instance, and aims to spread cricket throughout the world.
