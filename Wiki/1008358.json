 "text": "The minimal tree frog (Zhangixalus minimus) is a frog. It lives in China. People have seen it in one place, Dayao Mountain in Guangxi Province. People have seen this frog in evergreen forests with trees that have leaves (not pine trees). The adults sit on small woody plants or near ponds. People have seen them next ot roads. The female frog makes a white foam nest to lay eggs in. People have seen this frog between 900 and 1600 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. The frog's home has at least one protected park in it: Huaping Nature Reserve. There used to be some threat from people cutting down trees, but much of this has stopped. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
