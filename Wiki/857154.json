 "text": "Guard mounting, changing the guard, or the changing of the guard, is an official ceremony in which guards that take place in duties at important places are swapped with different guards. The ceremonies are usually planned very well. They started during peaceful times and war fighting drills, with it becoming more popular from the 17th and 18th centuries as it helped make the army less tired and more useful.
