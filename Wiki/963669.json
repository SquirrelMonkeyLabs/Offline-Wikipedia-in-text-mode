 "text": "The Clink was a prison in Southwark, London. It operated from the 12th century until 1780. The prison served the Liberty of the Clink, a local manor area owned by the Bishop of Winchester. As the Liberty owner, the Bishop kept all revenues from the Clink, and could put people in prison for failing to make their payments. The Clink prison was next to the Bishop's London-area residence of Winchester Palace. The Clink was perhaps the oldest men's prison and probably the oldest women's prison in England.Clink Prison Museum The name has become slang as a term for prison or a jail cell.Free dictionary == References == Category:Prisons in England Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Southwark Category:12th-century buildings and structures",
